the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original . ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday to discuss a draft version of the european union constitution , the german foreign minister joschka fischer called on europe 's " big three " -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- to show solidarity .
at the same time , he expressed understanding for smaller member states ' concerns about the future distribution of power within the eu . unresolved issues related to the constitution may make it difficult for the larger members to present a united front , and the smaller countries may not be willing to let the triumvirate lead the way . fischer calls for unity , but understands smaller states ' concerns before heading off to brussels , fischer called on the eu 's other larger member states - france and britain - to work together and present a united front on policy matters .
perhaps riding high from the eu 's successful intervention in iran last week , which was spearheaded by the three nations who all sent their foreign ministers to tehran , fischer told the german daily newspaper , the stuttgarter zeitung , that the iran mission showed how the " big three " must agree if the eu is to be effective . but fears of this kind of collective posturing is precisely what has smaller eu member states worried that their larger neighbors are planning a power grab .
and structural changes proposed within the eu draft constitution have done little to soothe these fears . many of the smaller states are against a proposal to cap the number of representatives to the european commission at 15 , which means each member state wo n't have a permanent voting representative .
offering an olive branch to the eu 's smaller states , joschka fischer told reporters in brussels on monday that he was sympathetic to such concerns . " there is clearly a contradiction between the need for efficiency , which supports the idea of a smaller commission , and the symbolic value of each state having its own permanent member , " fischer said .
he added that finding a consensus on the matter would n't be easy . other contentious points remain , including a proposal to replace the eu 's rotating presidency with a permanent one and a proposal to replace the current voting system with double majority voting , with influence allocated based on the size of states . as the end of the year approaches , the ministers are working against the clock to come up with an agreement all will sign on to .
italy , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency hopes to complete negotiations over the constitution by the end of the year . back to where they started from the draft version of the constitution was released to the public in june , after 15 months of careful negotiating within the convention on the future of europe .
at the time , many european leaders , fischer included , warned other nations not to fiddle with the delicate compromises the document contained . but since then , the eu has received more than 80 requests for changes , which has threatened to unravel the whole process and sparked several rounds of debate .
in the end however , fischer told reporters in brussels he thinks they will return to the original . " the more we go around about this , the more the opinion spreads - without anyone articulating it - that the draft we already have is actually very good , " said fischer . indeed , fischer 's assessment of the situation will have to prove true , if the eu member states are to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the year .
otherwise , the debate may continue well into next year 's irish presidency . italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , admits that he is eager to reach a consensus , but says the foreign ministers should not agree to accept any compromises that would threaten the ability of the eu to work effectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise or bust for eu constitution european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis -lrb- oct .

at the same time , he expressed understanding for smaller member states ' concerns about the future distribution of power within the eu . unresolved issues related to the constitution may make it difficult for the larger members to present a united front , and the smaller countries may not be willing to let the triumvirate lead the way . fischer calls for unity , but understands smaller states ' concerns before heading off to brussels , fischer called on the eu 's other larger member states - france and britain - to work together and present a united front on policy matters .
perhaps riding high from the eu 's successful intervention in iran last week , which was spearheaded by the three nations who all sent their foreign ministers to tehran , fischer told the german daily newspaper , the stuttgarter zeitung , that the iran mission showed how the " big three " must agree if the eu is to be effective . but fears of this kind of collective posturing is precisely what has smaller eu member states worried that their larger neighbors are planning a power grab .
and structural changes proposed within the eu draft constitution have done little to soothe these fears . many of the smaller states are against a proposal to cap the number of representatives to the european commission at 15 , which means each member state wo n't have a permanent voting representative .
offering an olive branch to the eu 's smaller states , joschka fischer told reporters in brussels on monday that he was sympathetic to such concerns . " there is clearly a contradiction between the need for efficiency , which supports the idea of a smaller commission , and the symbolic value of each state having its own permanent member , " fischer said .
he added that finding a consensus on the matter would n't be easy . other contentious points remain , including a proposal to replace the eu 's rotating presidency with a permanent one and a proposal to replace the current voting system with double majority voting , with influence allocated based on the size of states . as the end of the year approaches , the ministers are working against the clock to come up with an agreement all will sign on to .
italy , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency hopes to complete negotiations over the constitution by the end of the year . back to where they started from the draft version of the constitution was released to the public in june , after 15 months of careful negotiating within the convention on the future of europe .
at the time , many european leaders , fischer included , warned other nations not to fiddle with the delicate compromises the document contained . but since then , the eu has received more than 80 requests for changes , which has threatened to unravel the whole process and sparked several rounds of debate .
in the end however , fischer told reporters in brussels he thinks they will return to the original . " the more we go around about this , the more the opinion spreads - without anyone articulating it - that the draft we already have is actually very good , " said fischer . indeed , fischer 's assessment of the situation will have to prove true , if the eu member states are to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the year .
otherwise , the debate may continue well into next year 's irish presidency . italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , admits that he is eager to reach a consensus , but says the foreign ministers should not agree to accept any compromises that would threaten the ability of the eu to work effectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise or bust for eu constitution european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis -lrb- oct .

the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original . ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday to discuss a draft version of the european union constitution , the german foreign minister joschka fischer called on europe 's " big three " -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- to show solidarity .
at the same time , he expressed understanding for smaller member states ' concerns about the future distribution of power within the eu . unresolved issues related to the constitution may make it difficult for the larger members to present a united front , and the smaller countries may not be willing to let the triumvirate lead the way . fischer calls for unity , but understands smaller states ' concerns before heading off to brussels , fischer called on the eu 's other larger member states - france and britain - to work together and present a united front on policy matters .
perhaps riding high from the eu 's successful intervention in iran last week , which was spearheaded by the three nations who all sent their foreign ministers to tehran , fischer told the german daily newspaper , the stuttgarter zeitung , that the iran mission showed how the " big three " must agree if the eu is to be effective . but fears of this kind of collective posturing is precisely what has smaller eu member states worried that their larger neighbors are planning a power grab .
and structural changes proposed within the eu draft constitution have done little to soothe these fears . many of the smaller states are against a proposal to cap the number of representatives to the european commission at 15 , which means each member state wo n't have a permanent voting representative .
offering an olive branch to the eu 's smaller states , joschka fischer told reporters in brussels on monday that he was sympathetic to such concerns . " there is clearly a contradiction between the need for efficiency , which supports the idea of a smaller commission , and the symbolic value of each state having its own permanent member , " fischer said .
he added that finding a consensus on the matter would n't be easy . other contentious points remain , including a proposal to replace the eu 's rotating presidency with a permanent one and a proposal to replace the current voting system with double majority voting , with influence allocated based on the size of states . as the end of the year approaches , the ministers are working against the clock to come up with an agreement all will sign on to .
italy , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency hopes to complete negotiations over the constitution by the end of the year . back to where they started from the draft version of the constitution was released to the public in june , after 15 months of careful negotiating within the convention on the future of europe .
at the time , many european leaders , fischer included , warned other nations not to fiddle with the delicate compromises the document contained . but since then , the eu has received more than 80 requests for changes , which has threatened to unravel the whole process and sparked several rounds of debate .
in the end however , fischer told reporters in brussels he thinks they will return to the original . " the more we go around about this , the more the opinion spreads - without anyone articulating it - that the draft we already have is actually very good , " said fischer . indeed , fischer 's assessment of the situation will have to prove true , if the eu member states are to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the year .

but in the run up to the summit , raffarin made the surprise announcement that he believes other european union member states , including britain , should be privy to such meetings .
he told a german newspaper that while the franco-german relationship is important , " it ’ s not sufficient anymore . "
" it ’ s more important to expand our alliance than to weaken it , " raffarin told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a leading german daily .
" at the same time , our countries would be disquieted by a 25-member europe where efficient work is impossible .
for that reason , the german-french alliance is important , but not sufficient . "
raffarin said the special relationship between france and germany is making some eu partners nervous .
the governments in berlin and paris can act as a motor for the eu , but they shouldn ’ t be directing the traffic .
the strategic and institutional alliances that have been built up in recent years by paris and berlin could also be buttressed by the inclusion of britain , raffarin told the paper .
this would serve the eu particularly well , he added , when it comes to creating a common european defense and foreign policy .
he signaled that smaller eu states would also be welcome to join the dialogue .
increased regional cooperation the meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown of poitiers is meant to facilitate greater cooperation between germany ’ s states , or länder , and france ’ s regions in order to strengthen the franco-german alliance on a more local level .
raffarin recently introduced constitutional changes to give france ’ s 22 regions more independence , though he maintains that there is still a great difference between france ’ s decentralized government and germany ’ s federalist system .
" we ’ re not a federation , " he told the paper , " a french region could never be compared with a german bundesland . "
but that doesn ’ t rule out franco-german regional cooperation , he said .
on the agenda at poitiers are consultations about the economy , competition , research and technology .
the idea is to create competency networks between regions with similar industrial make-up or similar research interests .
another project due to be discussed is the creation of a joint french-german history book .
expanding the club it ’ s not clear yet how germany will react to raffarin ’ s recommendations to widen the circle of friendship to include other eu countries .
it was only earlier this year that berlin and paris reaffirmed their post-war relationship , with celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the elysee treaty , the document that sealed the franco-german friendship following the bitter divisions caused by world war ii .
raffarin ’ s stated aim , is to have more political engagement in europe , and reduce euro-skepticism , especially now as the eu prepares to take on 10 new member countries in 2004 .
several of those countries have expressed their fears that the larger , more powerful eu states will dominate the political agenda .

vw will officially release the figures on october 29th , but a report in spiegel magazine this week quoted a " top manager " as saying profits totalled just € 2million , compared to € 4.8 last year .
the costs of introducing the new golf , the weak dollar , and the crisis in brazil , where vw runs several production sites , were all sighted as reasons for the drop .
the downturn is not entirely unexpected : a report in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung at the beginning of october quoted a company source as reporting much the same thing , though no figures were named .
all the same , executives at the german carmaker are optimistic that 2004 will see things turnaround , and sales of the new golf - 135,000 will roll off the production line by the end of this year - will help turn things around . dw-world.de stop and go in 2003 for german carmakers as 2003 comes to a close , it looks like the year will offer the german car industry more than just gloom and doom -lrb- oct .

but in the run up to the summit , raffarin made the surprise announcement that he believes other european union member states , including britain , should be privy to such meetings .
he told a german newspaper that while the franco-german relationship is important , " it ’ s not sufficient anymore . "
" it ’ s more important to expand our alliance than to weaken it , " raffarin told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a leading german daily .
" at the same time , our countries would be disquieted by a 25-member europe where efficient work is impossible .
for that reason , the german-french alliance is important , but not sufficient . "
raffarin said the special relationship between france and germany is making some eu partners nervous .
the governments in berlin and paris can act as a motor for the eu , but they shouldn ’ t be directing the traffic .
the strategic and institutional alliances that have been built up in recent years by paris and berlin could also be buttressed by the inclusion of britain , raffarin told the paper .
this would serve the eu particularly well , he added , when it comes to creating a common european defense and foreign policy .
he signaled that smaller eu states would also be welcome to join the dialogue .
increased regional cooperation the meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown of poitiers is meant to facilitate greater cooperation between germany ’ s states , or länder , and france ’ s regions in order to strengthen the franco-german alliance on a more local level .
raffarin recently introduced constitutional changes to give france ’ s 22 regions more independence , though he maintains that there is still a great difference between france ’ s decentralized government and germany ’ s federalist system .
" we ’ re not a federation , " he told the paper , " a french region could never be compared with a german bundesland . "
but that doesn ’ t rule out franco-german regional cooperation , he said .
on the agenda at poitiers are consultations about the economy , competition , research and technology .
the idea is to create competency networks between regions with similar industrial make-up or similar research interests .
another project due to be discussed is the creation of a joint french-german history book .
expanding the club it ’ s not clear yet how germany will react to raffarin ’ s recommendations to widen the circle of friendship to include other eu countries .
it was only earlier this year that berlin and paris reaffirmed their post-war relationship , with celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the elysee treaty , the document that sealed the franco-german friendship following the bitter divisions caused by world war ii .
raffarin ’ s stated aim , is to have more political engagement in europe , and reduce euro-skepticism , especially now as the eu prepares to take on 10 new member countries in 2004 .
several of those countries have expressed their fears that the larger , more powerful eu states will dominate the political agenda .

but in the run up to the summit , raffarin made the surprise announcement that he believes other european union member states , including britain , should be privy to such meetings .
he told a german newspaper that while the franco-german relationship is important , " it ’ s not sufficient anymore . "
" it ’ s more important to expand our alliance than to weaken it , " raffarin told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a leading german daily .
" at the same time , our countries would be disquieted by a 25-member europe where efficient work is impossible .
for that reason , the german-french alliance is important , but not sufficient . "
raffarin said the special relationship between france and germany is making some eu partners nervous .
the governments in berlin and paris can act as a motor for the eu , but they shouldn ’ t be directing the traffic .
the strategic and institutional alliances that have been built up in recent years by paris and berlin could also be buttressed by the inclusion of britain , raffarin told the paper .
this would serve the eu particularly well , he added , when it comes to creating a common european defense and foreign policy .
he signaled that smaller eu states would also be welcome to join the dialogue .
increased regional cooperation the meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown of poitiers is meant to facilitate greater cooperation between germany ’ s states , or länder , and france ’ s regions in order to strengthen the franco-german alliance on a more local level .
raffarin recently introduced constitutional changes to give france ’ s 22 regions more independence , though he maintains that there is still a great difference between france ’ s decentralized government and germany ’ s federalist system .
" we ’ re not a federation , " he told the paper , " a french region could never be compared with a german bundesland . "
but that doesn ’ t rule out franco-german regional cooperation , he said .
on the agenda at poitiers are consultations about the economy , competition , research and technology .
the idea is to create competency networks between regions with similar industrial make-up or similar research interests .
another project due to be discussed is the creation of a joint french-german history book .
expanding the club it ’ s not clear yet how germany will react to raffarin ’ s recommendations to widen the circle of friendship to include other eu countries .
it was only earlier this year that berlin and paris reaffirmed their post-war relationship , with celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the elysee treaty , the document that sealed the franco-german friendship following the bitter divisions caused by world war ii .
raffarin ’ s stated aim , is to have more political engagement in europe , and reduce euro-skepticism , especially now as the eu prepares to take on 10 new member countries in 2004 .
several of those countries have expressed their fears that the larger , more powerful eu states will dominate the political agenda .

for that reason , the german-french alliance is important , but not sufficient . "
raffarin said the special relationship between france and germany is making some eu partners nervous .
the governments in berlin and paris can act as a motor for the eu , but they shouldn ’ t be directing the traffic .
the strategic and institutional alliances that have been built up in recent years by paris and berlin could also be buttressed by the inclusion of britain , raffarin told the paper .
this would serve the eu particularly well , he added , when it comes to creating a common european defense and foreign policy .
he signaled that smaller eu states would also be welcome to join the dialogue .
increased regional cooperation the meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown of poitiers is meant to facilitate greater cooperation between germany ’ s states , or länder , and france ’ s regions in order to strengthen the franco-german alliance on a more local level .
raffarin recently introduced constitutional changes to give france ’ s 22 regions more independence , though he maintains that there is still a great difference between france ’ s decentralized government and germany ’ s federalist system .
" we ’ re not a federation , " he told the paper , " a french region could never be compared with a german bundesland . "
but that doesn ’ t rule out franco-german regional cooperation , he said .
on the agenda at poitiers are consultations about the economy , competition , research and technology .
the idea is to create competency networks between regions with similar industrial make-up or similar research interests .
another project due to be discussed is the creation of a joint french-german history book .
expanding the club it ’ s not clear yet how germany will react to raffarin ’ s recommendations to widen the circle of friendship to include other eu countries .
it was only earlier this year that berlin and paris reaffirmed their post-war relationship , with celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the elysee treaty , the document that sealed the franco-german friendship following the bitter divisions caused by world war ii .
raffarin ’ s stated aim , is to have more political engagement in europe , and reduce euro-skepticism , especially now as the eu prepares to take on 10 new member countries in 2004 .
several of those countries have expressed their fears that the larger , more powerful eu states will dominate the political agenda .

for the first time since germany ’ s reunification in 1990 , the spd fell well behind the opposition christian democratic union and the former communist party of democratic socialists in many brandenburg cities .
compared to the last vote five years ago , the ruling spd lost 15 to 16 percent for a all-time low of 21 percent while the cdu pulled ahead to about 28 percent .
state premier matthias platzcek -lrb- spd -rrb- attributed his party ’ s slip in popularity to the federal politics of chancellor schröder .
" it didn ’ t help us at all , " he said referring to the package of austere social and economic reforms schröder and the federal coalition of spd and greens is pushing through parliament .
the setback in brandenburg is part of a larger trend of losses for the spd across the country .

daimler personnel chairman günther fleig told the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper that the company , under the working name job-start , would be created by 2005 and would be responsible for finding jobs within the company for daimler trainees as well as retraining existing employees to work in different daimler jobs as the need arises .
however , a cornerstone of the plan – one that would require workers to move to any of the company ’ s factories where their services are needed – drew criticism from daimler ’ s employee association .
" if implemented , the consequence of these plans would be that every future manufacturing employee would become a modern working nomad , having to move from factory to factory , " said worker ’ s council chairman erich klemm .
but daimler ’ s fleig said the plan would lead to better employee training as well as making employees more attractive to the company for longer due to retraining opportunities . more briefs 27.10.2003 -pipe- new pipelines for germany 's " chemical coast " 27.10.2003 -pipe- profits down at volkswagen 27.10.2003 -pipe- star alliance welcomes lot aboard 24.10.2003 -pipe- germany has fewest women managers in europe 24.10.2003 -pipe- poll : germans blame kohl government for economic woes 24.10.2003 -pipe- german import prices fall in september 23.10.2003 -pipe- germans work 25 percent less than in 1970 23.10.2003 -pipe- lufthansa wants to begin service to baghdad radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the 390-kilometer long pipeline will transport ethylene from the u.s.-owned chemical concern dow , located on the elbe , to its german subsidiary chemie-dreieck .
three other major pipelines are in the planning stages and should go in to operation over the next few years .
ethylene is made from natural gas and oil and serves as the basis for other chemicals which are used to make bottles and pipes .
though not poisonous , the chemical is very flammable , making its transportation through pipelines safer than above ground via truck or train .
lower saxony is looking to reinforce its reputation as the country 's " chemical coast " through the pipeline network and hopes to establish the region as a center for chemical production and protect 5,000 jobs related to the chemical industry . more briefs 27.10.2003 -pipe- profits down at volkswagen 27.10.2003 -pipe- star alliance welcomes lot aboard 24.10.2003 -pipe- germany has fewest women managers in europe 24.10.2003 -pipe- poll : germans blame kohl government for economic woes 24.10.2003 -pipe- german import prices fall in september 23.10.2003 -pipe- germans work 25 percent less than in 1970 23.10.2003 -pipe- lufthansa wants to begin service to baghdad 23.10.2003 -pipe- germany reportedly seeks refund for toll delays radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original . ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday to discuss a draft version of the european union constitution , the german foreign minister joschka fischer called on europe 's " big three " -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- to show solidarity .
at the same time , he expressed understanding for smaller member states ' concerns about the future distribution of power within the eu . unresolved issues related to the constitution may make it difficult for the larger members to present a united front , and the smaller countries may not be willing to let the triumvirate lead the way . fischer calls for unity , but understands smaller states ' concerns before heading off to brussels , fischer called on the eu 's other larger member states - france and britain - to work together and present a united front on policy matters .
perhaps riding high from the eu 's successful intervention in iran last week , which was spearheaded by the three nations who all sent their foreign ministers to tehran , fischer told the german daily newspaper , the stuttgarter zeitung , that the iran mission showed how the " big three " must agree if the eu is to be effective . but fears of this kind of collective posturing is precisely what has smaller eu member states worried that their larger neighbors are planning a power grab .

perhaps riding high from the eu 's successful intervention in iran last week , which was spearheaded by the three nations who all sent their foreign ministers to tehran , fischer told the german daily newspaper , the stuttgarter zeitung , that the iran mission showed how the " big three " must agree if the eu is to be effective . but fears of this kind of collective posturing is precisely what has smaller eu member states worried that their larger neighbors are planning a power grab .
and structural changes proposed within the eu draft constitution have done little to soothe these fears . many of the smaller states are against a proposal to cap the number of representatives to the european commission at 15 , which means each member state wo n't have a permanent voting representative .
offering an olive branch to the eu 's smaller states , joschka fischer told reporters in brussels on monday that he was sympathetic to such concerns . " there is clearly a contradiction between the need for efficiency , which supports the idea of a smaller commission , and the symbolic value of each state having its own permanent member , " fischer said .
he added that finding a consensus on the matter would n't be easy . other contentious points remain , including a proposal to replace the eu 's rotating presidency with a permanent one and a proposal to replace the current voting system with double majority voting , with influence allocated based on the size of states . as the end of the year approaches , the ministers are working against the clock to come up with an agreement all will sign on to .
italy , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency hopes to complete negotiations over the constitution by the end of the year . back to where they started from the draft version of the constitution was released to the public in june , after 15 months of careful negotiating within the convention on the future of europe .
at the time , many european leaders , fischer included , warned other nations not to fiddle with the delicate compromises the document contained . but since then , the eu has received more than 80 requests for changes , which has threatened to unravel the whole process and sparked several rounds of debate .
in the end however , fischer told reporters in brussels he thinks they will return to the original . " the more we go around about this , the more the opinion spreads - without anyone articulating it - that the draft we already have is actually very good , " said fischer . indeed , fischer 's assessment of the situation will have to prove true , if the eu member states are to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the year .
otherwise , the debate may continue well into next year 's irish presidency . italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , admits that he is eager to reach a consensus , but says the foreign ministers should not agree to accept any compromises that would threaten the ability of the eu to work effectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise or bust for eu constitution european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis -lrb- oct .

the strategic and institutional alliances that have been built up in recent years by paris and berlin could also be buttressed by the inclusion of britain , raffarin told the paper .
this would serve the eu particularly well , he added , when it comes to creating a common european defense and foreign policy .
he signaled that smaller eu states would also be welcome to join the dialogue .
increased regional cooperation the meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown of poitiers is meant to facilitate greater cooperation between germany ’ s states , or länder , and france ’ s regions in order to strengthen the franco-german alliance on a more local level .
raffarin recently introduced constitutional changes to give france ’ s 22 regions more independence , though he maintains that there is still a great difference between france ’ s decentralized government and germany ’ s federalist system .
" we ’ re not a federation , " he told the paper , " a french region could never be compared with a german bundesland . "
but that doesn ’ t rule out franco-german regional cooperation , he said .
on the agenda at poitiers are consultations about the economy , competition , research and technology .
the idea is to create competency networks between regions with similar industrial make-up or similar research interests .
another project due to be discussed is the creation of a joint french-german history book .
expanding the club it ’ s not clear yet how germany will react to raffarin ’ s recommendations to widen the circle of friendship to include other eu countries .
it was only earlier this year that berlin and paris reaffirmed their post-war relationship , with celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the elysee treaty , the document that sealed the franco-german friendship following the bitter divisions caused by world war ii .
raffarin ’ s stated aim , is to have more political engagement in europe , and reduce euro-skepticism , especially now as the eu prepares to take on 10 new member countries in 2004 .

the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original . ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday to discuss a draft version of the european union constitution , the german foreign minister joschka fischer called on europe 's " big three " -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- to show solidarity .
at the same time , he expressed understanding for smaller member states ' concerns about the future distribution of power within the eu . unresolved issues related to the constitution may make it difficult for the larger members to present a united front , and the smaller countries may not be willing to let the triumvirate lead the way . fischer calls for unity , but understands smaller states ' concerns before heading off to brussels , fischer called on the eu 's other larger member states - france and britain - to work together and present a united front on policy matters .
perhaps riding high from the eu 's successful intervention in iran last week , which was spearheaded by the three nations who all sent their foreign ministers to tehran , fischer told the german daily newspaper , the stuttgarter zeitung , that the iran mission showed how the " big three " must agree if the eu is to be effective . but fears of this kind of collective posturing is precisely what has smaller eu member states worried that their larger neighbors are planning a power grab .
and structural changes proposed within the eu draft constitution have done little to soothe these fears . many of the smaller states are against a proposal to cap the number of representatives to the european commission at 15 , which means each member state wo n't have a permanent voting representative .
offering an olive branch to the eu 's smaller states , joschka fischer told reporters in brussels on monday that he was sympathetic to such concerns . " there is clearly a contradiction between the need for efficiency , which supports the idea of a smaller commission , and the symbolic value of each state having its own permanent member , " fischer said .
he added that finding a consensus on the matter would n't be easy . other contentious points remain , including a proposal to replace the eu 's rotating presidency with a permanent one and a proposal to replace the current voting system with double majority voting , with influence allocated based on the size of states . as the end of the year approaches , the ministers are working against the clock to come up with an agreement all will sign on to .
italy , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency hopes to complete negotiations over the constitution by the end of the year . back to where they started from the draft version of the constitution was released to the public in june , after 15 months of careful negotiating within the convention on the future of europe .
at the time , many european leaders , fischer included , warned other nations not to fiddle with the delicate compromises the document contained . but since then , the eu has received more than 80 requests for changes , which has threatened to unravel the whole process and sparked several rounds of debate .
in the end however , fischer told reporters in brussels he thinks they will return to the original . " the more we go around about this , the more the opinion spreads - without anyone articulating it - that the draft we already have is actually very good , " said fischer . indeed , fischer 's assessment of the situation will have to prove true , if the eu member states are to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the year .
otherwise , the debate may continue well into next year 's irish presidency . italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , admits that he is eager to reach a consensus , but says the foreign ministers should not agree to accept any compromises that would threaten the ability of the eu to work effectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise or bust for eu constitution european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis -lrb- oct .

" there is clearly a contradiction between the need for efficiency , which supports the idea of a smaller commission , and the symbolic value of each state having its own permanent member , " fischer said .
he added that finding a consensus on the matter would n't be easy . other contentious points remain , including a proposal to replace the eu 's rotating presidency with a permanent one and a proposal to replace the current voting system with double majority voting , with influence allocated based on the size of states . as the end of the year approaches , the ministers are working against the clock to come up with an agreement all will sign on to .

but in the run up to the summit , raffarin made the surprise announcement that he believes other european union member states , including britain , should be privy to such meetings .
he told a german newspaper that while the franco-german relationship is important , " it ’ s not sufficient anymore . "
" it ’ s more important to expand our alliance than to weaken it , " raffarin told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a leading german daily .
" at the same time , our countries would be disquieted by a 25-member europe where efficient work is impossible .
for that reason , the german-french alliance is important , but not sufficient . "
raffarin said the special relationship between france and germany is making some eu partners nervous .
the governments in berlin and paris can act as a motor for the eu , but they shouldn ’ t be directing the traffic .
the strategic and institutional alliances that have been built up in recent years by paris and berlin could also be buttressed by the inclusion of britain , raffarin told the paper .
this would serve the eu particularly well , he added , when it comes to creating a common european defense and foreign policy .
he signaled that smaller eu states would also be welcome to join the dialogue .
increased regional cooperation the meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown of poitiers is meant to facilitate greater cooperation between germany ’ s states , or länder , and france ’ s regions in order to strengthen the franco-german alliance on a more local level .
raffarin recently introduced constitutional changes to give france ’ s 22 regions more independence , though he maintains that there is still a great difference between france ’ s decentralized government and germany ’ s federalist system .
" we ’ re not a federation , " he told the paper , " a french region could never be compared with a german bundesland . "
but that doesn ’ t rule out franco-german regional cooperation , he said .
on the agenda at poitiers are consultations about the economy , competition , research and technology .
the idea is to create competency networks between regions with similar industrial make-up or similar research interests .
another project due to be discussed is the creation of a joint french-german history book .
expanding the club it ’ s not clear yet how germany will react to raffarin ’ s recommendations to widen the circle of friendship to include other eu countries .
it was only earlier this year that berlin and paris reaffirmed their post-war relationship , with celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the elysee treaty , the document that sealed the franco-german friendship following the bitter divisions caused by world war ii .
raffarin ’ s stated aim , is to have more political engagement in europe , and reduce euro-skepticism , especially now as the eu prepares to take on 10 new member countries in 2004 .
several of those countries have expressed their fears that the larger , more powerful eu states will dominate the political agenda .

the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original . ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday to discuss a draft version of the european union constitution , the german foreign minister joschka fischer called on europe 's " big three " -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- to show solidarity .
at the same time , he expressed understanding for smaller member states ' concerns about the future distribution of power within the eu . unresolved issues related to the constitution may make it difficult for the larger members to present a united front , and the smaller countries may not be willing to let the triumvirate lead the way . fischer calls for unity , but understands smaller states ' concerns before heading off to brussels , fischer called on the eu 's other larger member states - france and britain - to work together and present a united front on policy matters .
perhaps riding high from the eu 's successful intervention in iran last week , which was spearheaded by the three nations who all sent their foreign ministers to tehran , fischer told the german daily newspaper , the stuttgarter zeitung , that the iran mission showed how the " big three " must agree if the eu is to be effective . but fears of this kind of collective posturing is precisely what has smaller eu member states worried that their larger neighbors are planning a power grab .
and structural changes proposed within the eu draft constitution have done little to soothe these fears . many of the smaller states are against a proposal to cap the number of representatives to the european commission at 15 , which means each member state wo n't have a permanent voting representative .
offering an olive branch to the eu 's smaller states , joschka fischer told reporters in brussels on monday that he was sympathetic to such concerns . " there is clearly a contradiction between the need for efficiency , which supports the idea of a smaller commission , and the symbolic value of each state having its own permanent member , " fischer said .
he added that finding a consensus on the matter would n't be easy . other contentious points remain , including a proposal to replace the eu 's rotating presidency with a permanent one and a proposal to replace the current voting system with double majority voting , with influence allocated based on the size of states . as the end of the year approaches , the ministers are working against the clock to come up with an agreement all will sign on to .
italy , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency hopes to complete negotiations over the constitution by the end of the year . back to where they started from the draft version of the constitution was released to the public in june , after 15 months of careful negotiating within the convention on the future of europe .
at the time , many european leaders , fischer included , warned other nations not to fiddle with the delicate compromises the document contained . but since then , the eu has received more than 80 requests for changes , which has threatened to unravel the whole process and sparked several rounds of debate .
in the end however , fischer told reporters in brussels he thinks they will return to the original . " the more we go around about this , the more the opinion spreads - without anyone articulating it - that the draft we already have is actually very good , " said fischer . indeed , fischer 's assessment of the situation will have to prove true , if the eu member states are to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the year .
otherwise , the debate may continue well into next year 's irish presidency . italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , admits that he is eager to reach a consensus , but says the foreign ministers should not agree to accept any compromises that would threaten the ability of the eu to work effectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise or bust for eu constitution european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis -lrb- oct .

perhaps riding high from the eu 's successful intervention in iran last week , which was spearheaded by the three nations who all sent their foreign ministers to tehran , fischer told the german daily newspaper , the stuttgarter zeitung , that the iran mission showed how the " big three " must agree if the eu is to be effective . but fears of this kind of collective posturing is precisely what has smaller eu member states worried that their larger neighbors are planning a power grab .
and structural changes proposed within the eu draft constitution have done little to soothe these fears . many of the smaller states are against a proposal to cap the number of representatives to the european commission at 15 , which means each member state wo n't have a permanent voting representative .
offering an olive branch to the eu 's smaller states , joschka fischer told reporters in brussels on monday that he was sympathetic to such concerns . " there is clearly a contradiction between the need for efficiency , which supports the idea of a smaller commission , and the symbolic value of each state having its own permanent member , " fischer said .
he added that finding a consensus on the matter would n't be easy . other contentious points remain , including a proposal to replace the eu 's rotating presidency with a permanent one and a proposal to replace the current voting system with double majority voting , with influence allocated based on the size of states . as the end of the year approaches , the ministers are working against the clock to come up with an agreement all will sign on to .
italy , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency hopes to complete negotiations over the constitution by the end of the year . back to where they started from the draft version of the constitution was released to the public in june , after 15 months of careful negotiating within the convention on the future of europe .
at the time , many european leaders , fischer included , warned other nations not to fiddle with the delicate compromises the document contained . but since then , the eu has received more than 80 requests for changes , which has threatened to unravel the whole process and sparked several rounds of debate .
in the end however , fischer told reporters in brussels he thinks they will return to the original . " the more we go around about this , the more the opinion spreads - without anyone articulating it - that the draft we already have is actually very good , " said fischer . indeed , fischer 's assessment of the situation will have to prove true , if the eu member states are to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the year .

but in the run up to the summit , raffarin made the surprise announcement that he believes other european union member states , including britain , should be privy to such meetings .
he told a german newspaper that while the franco-german relationship is important , " it ’ s not sufficient anymore . "
" it ’ s more important to expand our alliance than to weaken it , " raffarin told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a leading german daily .
" at the same time , our countries would be disquieted by a 25-member europe where efficient work is impossible .
for that reason , the german-french alliance is important , but not sufficient . "
raffarin said the special relationship between france and germany is making some eu partners nervous .
the governments in berlin and paris can act as a motor for the eu , but they shouldn ’ t be directing the traffic .
the strategic and institutional alliances that have been built up in recent years by paris and berlin could also be buttressed by the inclusion of britain , raffarin told the paper .
this would serve the eu particularly well , he added , when it comes to creating a common european defense and foreign policy .
he signaled that smaller eu states would also be welcome to join the dialogue .
increased regional cooperation the meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown of poitiers is meant to facilitate greater cooperation between germany ’ s states , or länder , and france ’ s regions in order to strengthen the franco-german alliance on a more local level .
raffarin recently introduced constitutional changes to give france ’ s 22 regions more independence , though he maintains that there is still a great difference between france ’ s decentralized government and germany ’ s federalist system .
" we ’ re not a federation , " he told the paper , " a french region could never be compared with a german bundesland . "
but that doesn ’ t rule out franco-german regional cooperation , he said .
on the agenda at poitiers are consultations about the economy , competition , research and technology .
the idea is to create competency networks between regions with similar industrial make-up or similar research interests .
another project due to be discussed is the creation of a joint french-german history book .
expanding the club it ’ s not clear yet how germany will react to raffarin ’ s recommendations to widen the circle of friendship to include other eu countries .
it was only earlier this year that berlin and paris reaffirmed their post-war relationship , with celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the elysee treaty , the document that sealed the franco-german friendship following the bitter divisions caused by world war ii .
raffarin ’ s stated aim , is to have more political engagement in europe , and reduce euro-skepticism , especially now as the eu prepares to take on 10 new member countries in 2004 .

the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original . ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday to discuss a draft version of the european union constitution , the german foreign minister joschka fischer called on europe 's " big three " -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- to show solidarity .
at the same time , he expressed understanding for smaller member states ' concerns about the future distribution of power within the eu . unresolved issues related to the constitution may make it difficult for the larger members to present a united front , and the smaller countries may not be willing to let the triumvirate lead the way . fischer calls for unity , but understands smaller states ' concerns before heading off to brussels , fischer called on the eu 's other larger member states - france and britain - to work together and present a united front on policy matters .
perhaps riding high from the eu 's successful intervention in iran last week , which was spearheaded by the three nations who all sent their foreign ministers to tehran , fischer told the german daily newspaper , the stuttgarter zeitung , that the iran mission showed how the " big three " must agree if the eu is to be effective . but fears of this kind of collective posturing is precisely what has smaller eu member states worried that their larger neighbors are planning a power grab .
and structural changes proposed within the eu draft constitution have done little to soothe these fears . many of the smaller states are against a proposal to cap the number of representatives to the european commission at 15 , which means each member state wo n't have a permanent voting representative .
offering an olive branch to the eu 's smaller states , joschka fischer told reporters in brussels on monday that he was sympathetic to such concerns . " there is clearly a contradiction between the need for efficiency , which supports the idea of a smaller commission , and the symbolic value of each state having its own permanent member , " fischer said .
he added that finding a consensus on the matter would n't be easy . other contentious points remain , including a proposal to replace the eu 's rotating presidency with a permanent one and a proposal to replace the current voting system with double majority voting , with influence allocated based on the size of states . as the end of the year approaches , the ministers are working against the clock to come up with an agreement all will sign on to .
italy , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency hopes to complete negotiations over the constitution by the end of the year . back to where they started from the draft version of the constitution was released to the public in june , after 15 months of careful negotiating within the convention on the future of europe .
at the time , many european leaders , fischer included , warned other nations not to fiddle with the delicate compromises the document contained . but since then , the eu has received more than 80 requests for changes , which has threatened to unravel the whole process and sparked several rounds of debate .
in the end however , fischer told reporters in brussels he thinks they will return to the original . " the more we go around about this , the more the opinion spreads - without anyone articulating it - that the draft we already have is actually very good , " said fischer . indeed , fischer 's assessment of the situation will have to prove true , if the eu member states are to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the year .
otherwise , the debate may continue well into next year 's irish presidency . italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , admits that he is eager to reach a consensus , but says the foreign ministers should not agree to accept any compromises that would threaten the ability of the eu to work effectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise or bust for eu constitution european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis -lrb- oct .

but in the run up to the summit , raffarin made the surprise announcement that he believes other european union member states , including britain , should be privy to such meetings .
he told a german newspaper that while the franco-german relationship is important , " it ’ s not sufficient anymore . "
" it ’ s more important to expand our alliance than to weaken it , " raffarin told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a leading german daily .
" at the same time , our countries would be disquieted by a 25-member europe where efficient work is impossible .
for that reason , the german-french alliance is important , but not sufficient . "
raffarin said the special relationship between france and germany is making some eu partners nervous .
the governments in berlin and paris can act as a motor for the eu , but they shouldn ’ t be directing the traffic .
the strategic and institutional alliances that have been built up in recent years by paris and berlin could also be buttressed by the inclusion of britain , raffarin told the paper .
this would serve the eu particularly well , he added , when it comes to creating a common european defense and foreign policy .
he signaled that smaller eu states would also be welcome to join the dialogue .
increased regional cooperation the meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown of poitiers is meant to facilitate greater cooperation between germany ’ s states , or länder , and france ’ s regions in order to strengthen the franco-german alliance on a more local level .
raffarin recently introduced constitutional changes to give france ’ s 22 regions more independence , though he maintains that there is still a great difference between france ’ s decentralized government and germany ’ s federalist system .
" we ’ re not a federation , " he told the paper , " a french region could never be compared with a german bundesland . "
but that doesn ’ t rule out franco-german regional cooperation , he said .
on the agenda at poitiers are consultations about the economy , competition , research and technology .
the idea is to create competency networks between regions with similar industrial make-up or similar research interests .
another project due to be discussed is the creation of a joint french-german history book .
expanding the club it ’ s not clear yet how germany will react to raffarin ’ s recommendations to widen the circle of friendship to include other eu countries .
it was only earlier this year that berlin and paris reaffirmed their post-war relationship , with celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the elysee treaty , the document that sealed the franco-german friendship following the bitter divisions caused by world war ii .
raffarin ’ s stated aim , is to have more political engagement in europe , and reduce euro-skepticism , especially now as the eu prepares to take on 10 new member countries in 2004 .
several of those countries have expressed their fears that the larger , more powerful eu states will dominate the political agenda .

but in the run up to the summit , raffarin made the surprise announcement that he believes other european union member states , including britain , should be privy to such meetings .
he told a german newspaper that while the franco-german relationship is important , " it ’ s not sufficient anymore . "
" it ’ s more important to expand our alliance than to weaken it , " raffarin told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a leading german daily .
" at the same time , our countries would be disquieted by a 25-member europe where efficient work is impossible .
for that reason , the german-french alliance is important , but not sufficient . "
raffarin said the special relationship between france and germany is making some eu partners nervous .
the governments in berlin and paris can act as a motor for the eu , but they shouldn ’ t be directing the traffic .
the strategic and institutional alliances that have been built up in recent years by paris and berlin could also be buttressed by the inclusion of britain , raffarin told the paper .
this would serve the eu particularly well , he added , when it comes to creating a common european defense and foreign policy .
he signaled that smaller eu states would also be welcome to join the dialogue .
increased regional cooperation the meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown of poitiers is meant to facilitate greater cooperation between germany ’ s states , or länder , and france ’ s regions in order to strengthen the franco-german alliance on a more local level .
raffarin recently introduced constitutional changes to give france ’ s 22 regions more independence , though he maintains that there is still a great difference between france ’ s decentralized government and germany ’ s federalist system .
" we ’ re not a federation , " he told the paper , " a french region could never be compared with a german bundesland . "
but that doesn ’ t rule out franco-german regional cooperation , he said .
on the agenda at poitiers are consultations about the economy , competition , research and technology .
the idea is to create competency networks between regions with similar industrial make-up or similar research interests .
another project due to be discussed is the creation of a joint french-german history book .
expanding the club it ’ s not clear yet how germany will react to raffarin ’ s recommendations to widen the circle of friendship to include other eu countries .
it was only earlier this year that berlin and paris reaffirmed their post-war relationship , with celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the elysee treaty , the document that sealed the franco-german friendship following the bitter divisions caused by world war ii .
raffarin ’ s stated aim , is to have more political engagement in europe , and reduce euro-skepticism , especially now as the eu prepares to take on 10 new member countries in 2004 .
several of those countries have expressed their fears that the larger , more powerful eu states will dominate the political agenda .

the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original . ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday to discuss a draft version of the european union constitution , the german foreign minister joschka fischer called on europe 's " big three " -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- to show solidarity .
at the same time , he expressed understanding for smaller member states ' concerns about the future distribution of power within the eu . unresolved issues related to the constitution may make it difficult for the larger members to present a united front , and the smaller countries may not be willing to let the triumvirate lead the way . fischer calls for unity , but understands smaller states ' concerns before heading off to brussels , fischer called on the eu 's other larger member states - france and britain - to work together and present a united front on policy matters .
perhaps riding high from the eu 's successful intervention in iran last week , which was spearheaded by the three nations who all sent their foreign ministers to tehran , fischer told the german daily newspaper , the stuttgarter zeitung , that the iran mission showed how the " big three " must agree if the eu is to be effective . but fears of this kind of collective posturing is precisely what has smaller eu member states worried that their larger neighbors are planning a power grab .
and structural changes proposed within the eu draft constitution have done little to soothe these fears . many of the smaller states are against a proposal to cap the number of representatives to the european commission at 15 , which means each member state wo n't have a permanent voting representative .
offering an olive branch to the eu 's smaller states , joschka fischer told reporters in brussels on monday that he was sympathetic to such concerns . " there is clearly a contradiction between the need for efficiency , which supports the idea of a smaller commission , and the symbolic value of each state having its own permanent member , " fischer said .
he added that finding a consensus on the matter would n't be easy . other contentious points remain , including a proposal to replace the eu 's rotating presidency with a permanent one and a proposal to replace the current voting system with double majority voting , with influence allocated based on the size of states . as the end of the year approaches , the ministers are working against the clock to come up with an agreement all will sign on to .
italy , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency hopes to complete negotiations over the constitution by the end of the year . back to where they started from the draft version of the constitution was released to the public in june , after 15 months of careful negotiating within the convention on the future of europe .
at the time , many european leaders , fischer included , warned other nations not to fiddle with the delicate compromises the document contained . but since then , the eu has received more than 80 requests for changes , which has threatened to unravel the whole process and sparked several rounds of debate .
in the end however , fischer told reporters in brussels he thinks they will return to the original . " the more we go around about this , the more the opinion spreads - without anyone articulating it - that the draft we already have is actually very good , " said fischer . indeed , fischer 's assessment of the situation will have to prove true , if the eu member states are to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the year .
otherwise , the debate may continue well into next year 's irish presidency . italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , admits that he is eager to reach a consensus , but says the foreign ministers should not agree to accept any compromises that would threaten the ability of the eu to work effectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise or bust for eu constitution european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis -lrb- oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 27.10.2003 french president : germany , france must open up to rest of europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jean-pierre raffarin -lrb- left -rrb- and german chancellor gerhard schröder on the day of franco-german summit , france ’ s president says berlin and paris , which are enjoying their closest bond in years , should invite other eu members to join their political consultations . german chancellor gerhard schröder met monday evening with french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin in the french town of poitiers in one of the regular meetings of the french and german governments , which are intended to strengthen the franco-german alliance .
but in the run up to the summit , raffarin made the surprise announcement that he believes other european union member states , including britain , should be privy to such meetings .
he told a german newspaper that while the franco-german relationship is important , " it ’ s not sufficient anymore . "
" it ’ s more important to expand our alliance than to weaken it , " raffarin told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a leading german daily .
" at the same time , our countries would be disquieted by a 25-member europe where efficient work is impossible .
for that reason , the german-french alliance is important , but not sufficient . "
raffarin said the special relationship between france and germany is making some eu partners nervous .
the governments in berlin and paris can act as a motor for the eu , but they shouldn ’ t be directing the traffic .
the strategic and institutional alliances that have been built up in recent years by paris and berlin could also be buttressed by the inclusion of britain , raffarin told the paper .
this would serve the eu particularly well , he added , when it comes to creating a common european defense and foreign policy .
he signaled that smaller eu states would also be welcome to join the dialogue .
increased regional cooperation the meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown of poitiers is meant to facilitate greater cooperation between germany ’ s states , or länder , and france ’ s regions in order to strengthen the franco-german alliance on a more local level .
raffarin recently introduced constitutional changes to give france ’ s 22 regions more independence , though he maintains that there is still a great difference between france ’ s decentralized government and germany ’ s federalist system .
" we ’ re not a federation , " he told the paper , " a french region could never be compared with a german bundesland . "
but that doesn ’ t rule out franco-german regional cooperation , he said .
on the agenda at poitiers are consultations about the economy , competition , research and technology .
the idea is to create competency networks between regions with similar industrial make-up or similar research interests .
another project due to be discussed is the creation of a joint french-german history book .
expanding the club it ’ s not clear yet how germany will react to raffarin ’ s recommendations to widen the circle of friendship to include other eu countries .
it was only earlier this year that berlin and paris reaffirmed their post-war relationship , with celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the elysee treaty , the document that sealed the franco-german friendship following the bitter divisions caused by world war ii .
raffarin ’ s stated aim , is to have more political engagement in europe , and reduce euro-skepticism , especially now as the eu prepares to take on 10 new member countries in 2004 .
several of those countries have expressed their fears that the larger , more powerful eu states will dominate the political agenda .

the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original . ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday to discuss a draft version of the european union constitution , the german foreign minister joschka fischer called on europe 's " big three " -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- to show solidarity .
at the same time , he expressed understanding for smaller member states ' concerns about the future distribution of power within the eu . unresolved issues related to the constitution may make it difficult for the larger members to present a united front , and the smaller countries may not be willing to let the triumvirate lead the way . fischer calls for unity , but understands smaller states ' concerns before heading off to brussels , fischer called on the eu 's other larger member states - france and britain - to work together and present a united front on policy matters .
perhaps riding high from the eu 's successful intervention in iran last week , which was spearheaded by the three nations who all sent their foreign ministers to tehran , fischer told the german daily newspaper , the stuttgarter zeitung , that the iran mission showed how the " big three " must agree if the eu is to be effective . but fears of this kind of collective posturing is precisely what has smaller eu member states worried that their larger neighbors are planning a power grab .
and structural changes proposed within the eu draft constitution have done little to soothe these fears . many of the smaller states are against a proposal to cap the number of representatives to the european commission at 15 , which means each member state wo n't have a permanent voting representative .
offering an olive branch to the eu 's smaller states , joschka fischer told reporters in brussels on monday that he was sympathetic to such concerns . " there is clearly a contradiction between the need for efficiency , which supports the idea of a smaller commission , and the symbolic value of each state having its own permanent member , " fischer said .
he added that finding a consensus on the matter would n't be easy . other contentious points remain , including a proposal to replace the eu 's rotating presidency with a permanent one and a proposal to replace the current voting system with double majority voting , with influence allocated based on the size of states . as the end of the year approaches , the ministers are working against the clock to come up with an agreement all will sign on to .
italy , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency hopes to complete negotiations over the constitution by the end of the year . back to where they started from the draft version of the constitution was released to the public in june , after 15 months of careful negotiating within the convention on the future of europe .
at the time , many european leaders , fischer included , warned other nations not to fiddle with the delicate compromises the document contained . but since then , the eu has received more than 80 requests for changes , which has threatened to unravel the whole process and sparked several rounds of debate .
in the end however , fischer told reporters in brussels he thinks they will return to the original . " the more we go around about this , the more the opinion spreads - without anyone articulating it - that the draft we already have is actually very good , " said fischer . indeed , fischer 's assessment of the situation will have to prove true , if the eu member states are to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the year .
otherwise , the debate may continue well into next year 's irish presidency . italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , admits that he is eager to reach a consensus , but says the foreign ministers should not agree to accept any compromises that would threaten the ability of the eu to work effectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise or bust for eu constitution european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis -lrb- oct .

but in the run up to the summit , raffarin made the surprise announcement that he believes other european union member states , including britain , should be privy to such meetings .
he told a german newspaper that while the franco-german relationship is important , " it ’ s not sufficient anymore . "
" it ’ s more important to expand our alliance than to weaken it , " raffarin told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a leading german daily .
" at the same time , our countries would be disquieted by a 25-member europe where efficient work is impossible .
for that reason , the german-french alliance is important , but not sufficient . "
raffarin said the special relationship between france and germany is making some eu partners nervous .
the governments in berlin and paris can act as a motor for the eu , but they shouldn ’ t be directing the traffic .
the strategic and institutional alliances that have been built up in recent years by paris and berlin could also be buttressed by the inclusion of britain , raffarin told the paper .
this would serve the eu particularly well , he added , when it comes to creating a common european defense and foreign policy .
he signaled that smaller eu states would also be welcome to join the dialogue .
increased regional cooperation the meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown of poitiers is meant to facilitate greater cooperation between germany ’ s states , or länder , and france ’ s regions in order to strengthen the franco-german alliance on a more local level .
raffarin recently introduced constitutional changes to give france ’ s 22 regions more independence , though he maintains that there is still a great difference between france ’ s decentralized government and germany ’ s federalist system .
" we ’ re not a federation , " he told the paper , " a french region could never be compared with a german bundesland . "
but that doesn ’ t rule out franco-german regional cooperation , he said .
on the agenda at poitiers are consultations about the economy , competition , research and technology .
the idea is to create competency networks between regions with similar industrial make-up or similar research interests .
another project due to be discussed is the creation of a joint french-german history book .
expanding the club it ’ s not clear yet how germany will react to raffarin ’ s recommendations to widen the circle of friendship to include other eu countries .
it was only earlier this year that berlin and paris reaffirmed their post-war relationship , with celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the elysee treaty , the document that sealed the franco-german friendship following the bitter divisions caused by world war ii .
raffarin ’ s stated aim , is to have more political engagement in europe , and reduce euro-skepticism , especially now as the eu prepares to take on 10 new member countries in 2004 .

the eu foreign ministers met in brussels on monday to discuss the draft version of the eu constitution .
though sticking points remain , joscka fischer thinks they will retain the original . ahead of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday to discuss a draft version of the european union constitution , the german foreign minister joschka fischer called on europe 's " big three " -lrb- germany , france and britain -rrb- to show solidarity .
at the same time , he expressed understanding for smaller member states ' concerns about the future distribution of power within the eu . unresolved issues related to the constitution may make it difficult for the larger members to present a united front , and the smaller countries may not be willing to let the triumvirate lead the way . fischer calls for unity , but understands smaller states ' concerns before heading off to brussels , fischer called on the eu 's other larger member states - france and britain - to work together and present a united front on policy matters .
perhaps riding high from the eu 's successful intervention in iran last week , which was spearheaded by the three nations who all sent their foreign ministers to tehran , fischer told the german daily newspaper , the stuttgarter zeitung , that the iran mission showed how the " big three " must agree if the eu is to be effective . but fears of this kind of collective posturing is precisely what has smaller eu member states worried that their larger neighbors are planning a power grab .
and structural changes proposed within the eu draft constitution have done little to soothe these fears . many of the smaller states are against a proposal to cap the number of representatives to the european commission at 15 , which means each member state wo n't have a permanent voting representative .
offering an olive branch to the eu 's smaller states , joschka fischer told reporters in brussels on monday that he was sympathetic to such concerns . " there is clearly a contradiction between the need for efficiency , which supports the idea of a smaller commission , and the symbolic value of each state having its own permanent member , " fischer said .
he added that finding a consensus on the matter would n't be easy . other contentious points remain , including a proposal to replace the eu 's rotating presidency with a permanent one and a proposal to replace the current voting system with double majority voting , with influence allocated based on the size of states . as the end of the year approaches , the ministers are working against the clock to come up with an agreement all will sign on to .
italy , the current holder of the rotating eu presidency hopes to complete negotiations over the constitution by the end of the year . back to where they started from the draft version of the constitution was released to the public in june , after 15 months of careful negotiating within the convention on the future of europe .
at the time , many european leaders , fischer included , warned other nations not to fiddle with the delicate compromises the document contained . but since then , the eu has received more than 80 requests for changes , which has threatened to unravel the whole process and sparked several rounds of debate .
in the end however , fischer told reporters in brussels he thinks they will return to the original . " the more we go around about this , the more the opinion spreads - without anyone articulating it - that the draft we already have is actually very good , " said fischer . indeed , fischer 's assessment of the situation will have to prove true , if the eu member states are to wrap up the negotiations by the end of the year .
otherwise , the debate may continue well into next year 's irish presidency . italy 's prime minister silvio berlusconi , admits that he is eager to reach a consensus , but says the foreign ministers should not agree to accept any compromises that would threaten the ability of the eu to work effectively . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de compromise or bust for eu constitution european commission president romano prodi has challenged eu members , current and future , to come to a consensus on the draft constitution or risk a crisis -lrb- oct .

but in the run up to the summit , raffarin made the surprise announcement that he believes other european union member states , including britain , should be privy to such meetings .
he told a german newspaper that while the franco-german relationship is important , " it ’ s not sufficient anymore . "
" it ’ s more important to expand our alliance than to weaken it , " raffarin told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung , a leading german daily .
" at the same time , our countries would be disquieted by a 25-member europe where efficient work is impossible .
for that reason , the german-french alliance is important , but not sufficient . "
raffarin said the special relationship between france and germany is making some eu partners nervous .
the governments in berlin and paris can act as a motor for the eu , but they shouldn ’ t be directing the traffic .
the strategic and institutional alliances that have been built up in recent years by paris and berlin could also be buttressed by the inclusion of britain , raffarin told the paper .
this would serve the eu particularly well , he added , when it comes to creating a common european defense and foreign policy .
he signaled that smaller eu states would also be welcome to join the dialogue .
increased regional cooperation the meeting in raffarin ’ s hometown of poitiers is meant to facilitate greater cooperation between germany ’ s states , or länder , and france ’ s regions in order to strengthen the franco-german alliance on a more local level .
raffarin recently introduced constitutional changes to give france ’ s 22 regions more independence , though he maintains that there is still a great difference between france ’ s decentralized government and germany ’ s federalist system .
" we ’ re not a federation , " he told the paper , " a french region could never be compared with a german bundesland . "
but that doesn ’ t rule out franco-german regional cooperation , he said .
on the agenda at poitiers are consultations about the economy , competition , research and technology .
the idea is to create competency networks between regions with similar industrial make-up or similar research interests .
another project due to be discussed is the creation of a joint french-german history book .
expanding the club it ’ s not clear yet how germany will react to raffarin ’ s recommendations to widen the circle of friendship to include other eu countries .
it was only earlier this year that berlin and paris reaffirmed their post-war relationship , with celebrations marking the 40th anniversary of the elysee treaty , the document that sealed the franco-german friendship following the bitter divisions caused by world war ii .
raffarin ’ s stated aim , is to have more political engagement in europe , and reduce euro-skepticism , especially now as the eu prepares to take on 10 new member countries in 2004 .
several of those countries have expressed their fears that the larger , more powerful eu states will dominate the political agenda .

he said the brothers , who had asked him to stop his revelations about their mother , were being used as " emotional cannons " in his row with buckingham palace .
he also said his book on princess diana , which comes out on monday , would never have been published if the royal family had made " just one phone call " to him .
the book has been serialised by the daily mirror for more than a week , and has included sensational revelations about the princess 's marriage , divorce , relationships and death .
speaking about the accusation that he had betrayed diana , he said : " i felt immediately that those boys were being manipulated and massaged by the system , by the palace , by the grey men in suits , by those people who did exactly the same to their mother . "

the county 's branch of roadpeace has been established by jean graham , from skegness , whose daughter cassie died in a road accident eight years ago .
mrs graham said the police were very helpful when her daughter died , but she still felt there was no-one around who really understood what her family was going through .
she said : " the volunteers are all people who have suffered from road deaths so they understand how you are feeling . "
susan spence , one of the first people to use the group , said : " it was great help to me - without it my anger would not have gone away .
" i was just so angry and there was no-one to help me . "
lincolnshire has one of the worst records in the country for road accidents - with 88 road-related deaths up to 20 october this year .
roadpeace also campaigns for better safety on the roads and tougher sentences for those who cause accidents .
