after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .
sweden had also demanded the closure of the coffee shops , where people for over 30 years have been able to buy and smoke cannabis without fearing legal repercussions . " we have a situation where in certain conditions we will not prosecute and these conditions are kept very strictly , " dutch justice minister piet hein donner told reporters .
" this decision does not cover that policy . " but he added that the netherlands had agreed to increase its penalties for the possession of small quantities of soft drugs from one month to a year in those circumstances which carried a sentence . plans to restrict shops to locals although remaining firm that the coffee shops would remain open , donner made some concessions .
among them was the annoucement that the dutch government would continue with its plans to restrict coffee shop owners from selling soft drugs to non-residents in a bid to halt drug tourism in holland . despite the dutch commitment to keeping the coffee shops open , those present were relieved to have reached agreement on the range of new laws which will cover all types of drug dealing , ranging from local networks to large-scale international operations . " europe has now equipped itself with an instrument to combat drug trafficking , " italy ’ s castelli said , beaming with weary satisfaction after having admitted earlier that it would be extremely difficult to achieve consensus . longer jail terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the agreed rules , offering , selling or producing drugs should be sanctioned with maximum jail terms of at least one to three years if individuals are caught producing or distributing drugs or cultivating opium poppies , coca bush or cannabis plants .
in cases involving large-scale international drug trafficking , jail terms should be at least five to 10 years , according to the agreement . new threat from expansion many in the eu say such an agreement is needed in view of the bloc 's eastern expansion in 2004 .
while the eu 's drug monitoring agency in lisbon reports that drug use inside the eu has been stabilizing after years of sharp increases , drug use has been rising in the 10 countries in central and eastern europe which will join the bloc next may . cnce considered simply transit areas for the movement of drugs to the eu , after accession the new member states will present traffickers with new and more lucrative markets . eu justice ministers say they hope that the severity of the new rules as well as the cross-border cooperation and harmonization will help combat the new threat and suppress the old . the agreed rules will now be passed to the european parliament for discussion .
if agreed upon there , the laws will enter into force 18 months after being formally approved by ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german and dutch ministers plan joint drug offensive german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis .

crushing the hopes of an entire region for economic recovery , the operating company of a proposed chip plant in eastern germany announced on friday that it will declare bankruptcy . the investors had already backed off and the federal government was showing no signs of making a last-ditch effort to save construction of the plant .
but a spokesman for the factor 's operating company on friday said there was still a slim chance that the project 's demise could be avoided : “ the board of directors still hasn ’ t signed the papers -lrb- to file for insolvency . -rrb- " the chip factory ’ s fate had already seemed sealed on thursday after government officials from the german state of brandenburg , who had supported the project with public funds , said that only the federal government could still salvage the plant . investors fail to give more money ever since its announcement three years ago , financing for the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project has been uncertain .
things came to a head when the plant ’ s biggest investor , the arab emirate of dubai , failed to hand over a payment of € 89 million in early november . the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million , didn ’ t send the money as it was waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million loan . brandenburg itself had given € 40 million to build the plant , which was intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , contributed the same amount . the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . need for new eu approval final straw a smaller plant would have required operating company communicant to file a completely new application for funds with the eu commission , setting back the project an additional six months , brandenburg ’ s former premier , manfred stolpe told german public television .
this additional delay had finally caused investors to jump ship , said stolpe , now responsible for pushing east german revitalization in the schröder government . his successor , matthias platzeck , had previously criticized stolpe for presenting the project as a sure thing three years ago .
stolpe countered that the chip plant ’ s financing had seemed solid at the time . the chip plant ’ s demise shocked residents of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the town at the german-polish border where the factory building ’ s shell had slowly risen over the past years . the area struggles with some of germany ’ s highest unemployment rates and people there saw the factory as a last hope for economic recovery .
about 1,300 jobs would have been created if the plant had been finished . third on a list of bad investments the chip plant became the third massive project with public investments in brandenburg to go belly up .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , filed for bankruptcy . state government officials hope to salvage the speedway by offering millions of euros in subsidies to a leaseholder .
a private consortium plans to fill cargolifter ’ s giant construction hall with the world ’ s largest indoor rain forest and open an amusement and water park there by oct .

cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

"
germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer : der kaiser of austria .
it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .
eichel makes a stand finance minister hans eichel was among the first into the fray last month when he criticized the cream of germany ’ s sporting heroes on a television talk show .
“ i ’ m not among the fans of people like boris becker , michael schumacher and franz beckenbauer , ” eichel said in an attack on those who have moved to switzerland and austria , where taxes are lower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : show me the money !
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker has had a taxing time .
it may be too much to expect a permanent return from boris becker , who was badly burned last year when a munich court convicted him of tax evasion and ordered him to pay a € 600,000 -lrb- $ 714,000 -rrb- fine .
it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .
fellow cross-border dwellers such as former wimbledon champion michael stich and champion speed skater anni friesinger are also happy to remain in austria while former tour de france champion jan ullrich has only just finished unpacking after he moved from the black forest to switzerland last year .
as for the racing schumacher brothers , the latest outburst from the government can not come as too much of a surprise , especially to ralf .
while his more successful and tactful brother michael keeps a low profile on his swiss farm , baby schumi has faced heated criticism since moving to salzburg in austria .
taxation jungle his cause was not helped by remarks he made last year which disparaged his home country .
“ germany is simply a taxation jungle , ” the younger schumacher said .
“ i don ’ t feel like having tax collectors on my heels .
i don ’ t want to be hunted down like boris becker or steffi graf .
that ’ s why i used the chance to go abroad for tax reasons . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's sporting heroes profit from successful year thanks to the sporting heroes who have contributed to one of the country 's most successful years for sport , things are n't all doom and gloom in germany .

police in hamburg have arrested an algerian suspected of being the ringleader of a network of al qaeda activitists who allegedly have been recruiting extremists in europe to carry out suicide attacks in iraq . the man , identified by as abderrazak mahdjoub , 29 , an algerian also known as “ the sheikh , ” was arrested on friday morning in this northern port city on the request of italian authorities , who are requesting he be handed over to them . “ he has been arrested on the basis of an italian investigation and been taken into custody pending extradition , ” marion zippel , a senior prosecutor in the hamburg prosecutor ’ s office , told reuters . mahdjoub is suspected of being the leader of a group of recruiters active in europe looking for people to travel to iraq to carry out suicide bombings .
one of the recruits , according to the arrest warrant , was suspected of involvement in the rocket attack in october on a baghdad hotel where u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz was staying . mahdjoub is also thought to have had contacts with the hamburg-based terror cell which carried out the sept .
11 attacks in the u.s. hamburg police had arrested mahdjoub in july on suspicion of plotting to bomb attack in spain , but he was released several months later for lack of evidence . the chief of germany 's foreign intelligence unit , august hanning , described iraq last week as a " crystallizing point " for the radical islamist cause .
he said activists were heading there from european countries to fight the u.s. occupation . in april , police said dozens of islamic extremists were being approached by recruiters in italy and germany .
they were then sent to training camps in syria before going to iraq to join a group with links to al qaeda . italian dragnet the arrest in hamburg was part of a larger italian-led anti-terror sweep carried out on thursday and friday .
prosecutors in milan had issued arrest warrants for five individuals suspected of being part of the terror cell .
all five were charged with association with the aim of international terrorism . italian police arrested two north africans in milan , also suspected of being members of the recruiting group .
they have been identified as housni jamal , 20 , of morocco and bouyahia maher ben abdelaziz , 33 , of tunisia . two others - an iraqi man and a tunisian woman - remain at large , the interior ministry in rome told the associated press .
the iraqi is suspected of having fled to syria while the woman is thought to have returned to her home country . the ministry confirmed earlier reports that a sixth man , a tunisian national , was arrested on saturday for allegedly providing assistance to the terror cell . since suicide bombers killed 19 italians in southern iraq earlier this month , italy has cracked down on people suspected of having links to terror networks .
rome recently expelled seven north africans accused of having links with militant groups and an imam from senegal who publicly expressed support for osama bin laden . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2003 chicken in the upper house großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite defeat in the bunderat , german agriculture minister vowed to keep fighting for free-range eggs .
cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .
more colors for cabs while taxi drivers didn ’ t demonstrate en mass in front of the bundesrat on friday , they still had strong opinions about a plan to do away with cab color restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light ivory 's no longer the only choice of color for german taxis .
for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .
government officials from the southwestern state of saarland , who pushed for the liberalization , said they will act swiftly to allow for more cab color variety . no more loopholes for clever sports managers germans of all hues were rubbed the wrong way recently when they discovered that soccer clubs such as borussia dortmund had managed to save a thousands of euros by making use of a loophole in germany ’ s tax system : by paying players tax-exempt overtime premiums for nighttime or weekend games , clubs could lower the base salaries they pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund players will no longer get tax-exempt overtime pay .
the tax exemption had been originally intended for low-paid workers such as nurses and policemen .
bundesrat members have now closed the loophole by limiting the tax exemption to people with monthly salaries of less than € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,600 -rrb- . free public parking as german municipalities struggle to fill budget holes caused by the weak economy , they ’ re bound to appreciate every euro that comes their way .
but as cities compete for customers in their downtown areas , some have started to question a federal law banning free short-term parking in spaces with parking meters . the bundesrat heard the complaints and decided to let municipalities decide for themselves whether they want to entice people to come to their urban shopping areas by offering free 30-minute parking or not . driving cars at 17 young germans have long eyed their peers in other countries with envy since german law says they can ’ t drive a car before the age of 18 .
that could soon change if the federal government agrees with a bundesrat decision to allow teenagers to get behind the wheel a year earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the bundesrat 's decision to lower the driving age , they 'll still be a little to young to drive a real beetle . the change in the law would require , however , that drivers under 18 be accompanied by an adult over the age of 30 .
proponents of the plan hope that the chaperoning would serve as an educational experience and help bring down the high accident rates among young drivers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cream-colored cabs soon a thing of the past ?
all german taxis have been cream-colored for more than two decades .
but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .

for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.11.2003 fashion , power and women ’ s rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long hours , low or no pay : a living hell for these vietnamese seamstresses .
cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .

cheap clothing has its price .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .
more colors for cabs while taxi drivers didn ’ t demonstrate en mass in front of the bundesrat on friday , they still had strong opinions about a plan to do away with cab color restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light ivory 's no longer the only choice of color for german taxis .
for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .
government officials from the southwestern state of saarland , who pushed for the liberalization , said they will act swiftly to allow for more cab color variety . no more loopholes for clever sports managers germans of all hues were rubbed the wrong way recently when they discovered that soccer clubs such as borussia dortmund had managed to save a thousands of euros by making use of a loophole in germany ’ s tax system : by paying players tax-exempt overtime premiums for nighttime or weekend games , clubs could lower the base salaries they pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund players will no longer get tax-exempt overtime pay .
the tax exemption had been originally intended for low-paid workers such as nurses and policemen .
bundesrat members have now closed the loophole by limiting the tax exemption to people with monthly salaries of less than € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,600 -rrb- . free public parking as german municipalities struggle to fill budget holes caused by the weak economy , they ’ re bound to appreciate every euro that comes their way .
but as cities compete for customers in their downtown areas , some have started to question a federal law banning free short-term parking in spaces with parking meters . the bundesrat heard the complaints and decided to let municipalities decide for themselves whether they want to entice people to come to their urban shopping areas by offering free 30-minute parking or not . driving cars at 17 young germans have long eyed their peers in other countries with envy since german law says they can ’ t drive a car before the age of 18 .
that could soon change if the federal government agrees with a bundesrat decision to allow teenagers to get behind the wheel a year earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the bundesrat 's decision to lower the driving age , they 'll still be a little to young to drive a real beetle . the change in the law would require , however , that drivers under 18 be accompanied by an adult over the age of 30 .
proponents of the plan hope that the chaperoning would serve as an educational experience and help bring down the high accident rates among young drivers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cream-colored cabs soon a thing of the past ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.11.2003 death blow for chip factory project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the chip factory 's half-finished building ever be completed ?
crushing the hopes of an entire region for economic recovery , the operating company of a proposed chip plant in eastern germany announced on friday that it will declare bankruptcy . the investors had already backed off and the federal government was showing no signs of making a last-ditch effort to save construction of the plant .
but a spokesman for the factor 's operating company on friday said there was still a slim chance that the project 's demise could be avoided : “ the board of directors still hasn ’ t signed the papers -lrb- to file for insolvency . -rrb- " the chip factory ’ s fate had already seemed sealed on thursday after government officials from the german state of brandenburg , who had supported the project with public funds , said that only the federal government could still salvage the plant . investors fail to give more money ever since its announcement three years ago , financing for the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project has been uncertain .
things came to a head when the plant ’ s biggest investor , the arab emirate of dubai , failed to hand over a payment of € 89 million in early november . the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million , didn ’ t send the money as it was waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million loan . brandenburg itself had given € 40 million to build the plant , which was intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .

cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2003 dutch stand firm on coffee shops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ministers agreed on tough new anti-drug measures , the dutch took it all in stride .
after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .
sweden had also demanded the closure of the coffee shops , where people for over 30 years have been able to buy and smoke cannabis without fearing legal repercussions . " we have a situation where in certain conditions we will not prosecute and these conditions are kept very strictly , " dutch justice minister piet hein donner told reporters .
" this decision does not cover that policy . " but he added that the netherlands had agreed to increase its penalties for the possession of small quantities of soft drugs from one month to a year in those circumstances which carried a sentence . plans to restrict shops to locals although remaining firm that the coffee shops would remain open , donner made some concessions .
among them was the annoucement that the dutch government would continue with its plans to restrict coffee shop owners from selling soft drugs to non-residents in a bid to halt drug tourism in holland . despite the dutch commitment to keeping the coffee shops open , those present were relieved to have reached agreement on the range of new laws which will cover all types of drug dealing , ranging from local networks to large-scale international operations . " europe has now equipped itself with an instrument to combat drug trafficking , " italy ’ s castelli said , beaming with weary satisfaction after having admitted earlier that it would be extremely difficult to achieve consensus . longer jail terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the agreed rules , offering , selling or producing drugs should be sanctioned with maximum jail terms of at least one to three years if individuals are caught producing or distributing drugs or cultivating opium poppies , coca bush or cannabis plants .
in cases involving large-scale international drug trafficking , jail terms should be at least five to 10 years , according to the agreement . new threat from expansion many in the eu say such an agreement is needed in view of the bloc 's eastern expansion in 2004 .
while the eu 's drug monitoring agency in lisbon reports that drug use inside the eu has been stabilizing after years of sharp increases , drug use has been rising in the 10 countries in central and eastern europe which will join the bloc next may . cnce considered simply transit areas for the movement of drugs to the eu , after accession the new member states will present traffickers with new and more lucrative markets . eu justice ministers say they hope that the severity of the new rules as well as the cross-border cooperation and harmonization will help combat the new threat and suppress the old . the agreed rules will now be passed to the european parliament for discussion .
if agreed upon there , the laws will enter into force 18 months after being formally approved by ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german and dutch ministers plan joint drug offensive german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis .

after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .

police in hamburg have arrested an algerian suspected of being the ringleader of a network of al qaeda activitists who allegedly have been recruiting extremists in europe to carry out suicide attacks in iraq . the man , identified by as abderrazak mahdjoub , 29 , an algerian also known as “ the sheikh , ” was arrested on friday morning in this northern port city on the request of italian authorities , who are requesting he be handed over to them . “ he has been arrested on the basis of an italian investigation and been taken into custody pending extradition , ” marion zippel , a senior prosecutor in the hamburg prosecutor ’ s office , told reuters . mahdjoub is suspected of being the leader of a group of recruiters active in europe looking for people to travel to iraq to carry out suicide bombings .
one of the recruits , according to the arrest warrant , was suspected of involvement in the rocket attack in october on a baghdad hotel where u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz was staying . mahdjoub is also thought to have had contacts with the hamburg-based terror cell which carried out the sept .
11 attacks in the u.s. hamburg police had arrested mahdjoub in july on suspicion of plotting to bomb attack in spain , but he was released several months later for lack of evidence . the chief of germany 's foreign intelligence unit , august hanning , described iraq last week as a " crystallizing point " for the radical islamist cause .
he said activists were heading there from european countries to fight the u.s. occupation . in april , police said dozens of islamic extremists were being approached by recruiters in italy and germany .
they were then sent to training camps in syria before going to iraq to join a group with links to al qaeda . italian dragnet the arrest in hamburg was part of a larger italian-led anti-terror sweep carried out on thursday and friday .
prosecutors in milan had issued arrest warrants for five individuals suspected of being part of the terror cell .
all five were charged with association with the aim of international terrorism . italian police arrested two north africans in milan , also suspected of being members of the recruiting group .
they have been identified as housni jamal , 20 , of morocco and bouyahia maher ben abdelaziz , 33 , of tunisia . two others - an iraqi man and a tunisian woman - remain at large , the interior ministry in rome told the associated press .
the iraqi is suspected of having fled to syria while the woman is thought to have returned to her home country . the ministry confirmed earlier reports that a sixth man , a tunisian national , was arrested on saturday for allegedly providing assistance to the terror cell . since suicide bombers killed 19 italians in southern iraq earlier this month , italy has cracked down on people suspected of having links to terror networks .

police in hamburg have arrested an algerian suspected of being the ringleader of a network of al qaeda activitists who allegedly have been recruiting extremists in europe to carry out suicide attacks in iraq . the man , identified by as abderrazak mahdjoub , 29 , an algerian also known as “ the sheikh , ” was arrested on friday morning in this northern port city on the request of italian authorities , who are requesting he be handed over to them . “ he has been arrested on the basis of an italian investigation and been taken into custody pending extradition , ” marion zippel , a senior prosecutor in the hamburg prosecutor ’ s office , told reuters . mahdjoub is suspected of being the leader of a group of recruiters active in europe looking for people to travel to iraq to carry out suicide bombings .
one of the recruits , according to the arrest warrant , was suspected of involvement in the rocket attack in october on a baghdad hotel where u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz was staying . mahdjoub is also thought to have had contacts with the hamburg-based terror cell which carried out the sept .
11 attacks in the u.s. hamburg police had arrested mahdjoub in july on suspicion of plotting to bomb attack in spain , but he was released several months later for lack of evidence . the chief of germany 's foreign intelligence unit , august hanning , described iraq last week as a " crystallizing point " for the radical islamist cause .
he said activists were heading there from european countries to fight the u.s. occupation . in april , police said dozens of islamic extremists were being approached by recruiters in italy and germany .
they were then sent to training camps in syria before going to iraq to join a group with links to al qaeda . italian dragnet the arrest in hamburg was part of a larger italian-led anti-terror sweep carried out on thursday and friday .
prosecutors in milan had issued arrest warrants for five individuals suspected of being part of the terror cell .
all five were charged with association with the aim of international terrorism . italian police arrested two north africans in milan , also suspected of being members of the recruiting group .
they have been identified as housni jamal , 20 , of morocco and bouyahia maher ben abdelaziz , 33 , of tunisia . two others - an iraqi man and a tunisian woman - remain at large , the interior ministry in rome told the associated press .
the iraqi is suspected of having fled to syria while the woman is thought to have returned to her home country . the ministry confirmed earlier reports that a sixth man , a tunisian national , was arrested on saturday for allegedly providing assistance to the terror cell . since suicide bombers killed 19 italians in southern iraq earlier this month , italy has cracked down on people suspected of having links to terror networks .

but for everyday use , german car-owners prefer japanese cars to the legendary names of their native country .
the stunning news is the result of two surveys conducted separately by car magazine autobild and german car-insurer adac .
the so-called automarxx survey , conducted by adac with the center for automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , asked more than 38,000 car owners to rank international car companies in terms of consumer satisfaction .
the german automobile industry 's first entry on the list is porsche at number eight .
toyota and honda lead a pack of asian rivals in the first seven spots .
the study , which will first be released to the public next week , is sure to disappoint the likes of mercedes and audi , who apparently enjoy a better reputation abroad than at home .
not even in the top five covering a range of areas from company strength and market position to design and environmental friendliness , the latest automarxx survey is the first to feature a consumer satisfaction section .
the consumer questionnaires looked at both the products and service of 33 manufacturers , and included ratings of electronics , motor power and comfort as well as of cost and standards of garage work .
while german brands mercedes , bmw , audi , volkswagen and porsche still occupy the top five of the overall rating section , they barely figure in the consumer satisfaction top ten , beaten by toyota at number one , followed by other asian competitors such as subaru , honda and mazda .

he said a mazda owner experiences " lasting satisfaction . "

cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer : der kaiser of austria .
it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .
eichel makes a stand finance minister hans eichel was among the first into the fray last month when he criticized the cream of germany ’ s sporting heroes on a television talk show .
“ i ’ m not among the fans of people like boris becker , michael schumacher and franz beckenbauer , ” eichel said in an attack on those who have moved to switzerland and austria , where taxes are lower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : show me the money !
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker has had a taxing time .
it may be too much to expect a permanent return from boris becker , who was badly burned last year when a munich court convicted him of tax evasion and ordered him to pay a € 600,000 -lrb- $ 714,000 -rrb- fine .
it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .
fellow cross-border dwellers such as former wimbledon champion michael stich and champion speed skater anni friesinger are also happy to remain in austria while former tour de france champion jan ullrich has only just finished unpacking after he moved from the black forest to switzerland last year .
as for the racing schumacher brothers , the latest outburst from the government can not come as too much of a surprise , especially to ralf .

germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .

crushing the hopes of an entire region for economic recovery , the operating company of a proposed chip plant in eastern germany announced on friday that it will declare bankruptcy . the investors had already backed off and the federal government was showing no signs of making a last-ditch effort to save construction of the plant .
but a spokesman for the factor 's operating company on friday said there was still a slim chance that the project 's demise could be avoided : “ the board of directors still hasn ’ t signed the papers -lrb- to file for insolvency . -rrb- " the chip factory ’ s fate had already seemed sealed on thursday after government officials from the german state of brandenburg , who had supported the project with public funds , said that only the federal government could still salvage the plant . investors fail to give more money ever since its announcement three years ago , financing for the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project has been uncertain .
things came to a head when the plant ’ s biggest investor , the arab emirate of dubai , failed to hand over a payment of € 89 million in early november . the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million , didn ’ t send the money as it was waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million loan . brandenburg itself had given € 40 million to build the plant , which was intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , contributed the same amount . the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . need for new eu approval final straw a smaller plant would have required operating company communicant to file a completely new application for funds with the eu commission , setting back the project an additional six months , brandenburg ’ s former premier , manfred stolpe told german public television .
this additional delay had finally caused investors to jump ship , said stolpe , now responsible for pushing east german revitalization in the schröder government . his successor , matthias platzeck , had previously criticized stolpe for presenting the project as a sure thing three years ago .
stolpe countered that the chip plant ’ s financing had seemed solid at the time . the chip plant ’ s demise shocked residents of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the town at the german-polish border where the factory building ’ s shell had slowly risen over the past years . the area struggles with some of germany ’ s highest unemployment rates and people there saw the factory as a last hope for economic recovery .
about 1,300 jobs would have been created if the plant had been finished . third on a list of bad investments the chip plant became the third massive project with public investments in brandenburg to go belly up .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , filed for bankruptcy . state government officials hope to salvage the speedway by offering millions of euros in subsidies to a leaseholder .
a private consortium plans to fill cargolifter ’ s giant construction hall with the world ’ s largest indoor rain forest and open an amusement and water park there by oct .

crushing the hopes of an entire region for economic recovery , the operating company of a proposed chip plant in eastern germany announced on friday that it will declare bankruptcy . the investors had already backed off and the federal government was showing no signs of making a last-ditch effort to save construction of the plant .
but a spokesman for the factor 's operating company on friday said there was still a slim chance that the project 's demise could be avoided : “ the board of directors still hasn ’ t signed the papers -lrb- to file for insolvency . -rrb- " the chip factory ’ s fate had already seemed sealed on thursday after government officials from the german state of brandenburg , who had supported the project with public funds , said that only the federal government could still salvage the plant . investors fail to give more money ever since its announcement three years ago , financing for the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project has been uncertain .
things came to a head when the plant ’ s biggest investor , the arab emirate of dubai , failed to hand over a payment of € 89 million in early november . the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million , didn ’ t send the money as it was waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million loan . brandenburg itself had given € 40 million to build the plant , which was intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .
more colors for cabs while taxi drivers didn ’ t demonstrate en mass in front of the bundesrat on friday , they still had strong opinions about a plan to do away with cab color restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light ivory 's no longer the only choice of color for german taxis .
for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .
government officials from the southwestern state of saarland , who pushed for the liberalization , said they will act swiftly to allow for more cab color variety . no more loopholes for clever sports managers germans of all hues were rubbed the wrong way recently when they discovered that soccer clubs such as borussia dortmund had managed to save a thousands of euros by making use of a loophole in germany ’ s tax system : by paying players tax-exempt overtime premiums for nighttime or weekend games , clubs could lower the base salaries they pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund players will no longer get tax-exempt overtime pay .

but as cities compete for customers in their downtown areas , some have started to question a federal law banning free short-term parking in spaces with parking meters . the bundesrat heard the complaints and decided to let municipalities decide for themselves whether they want to entice people to come to their urban shopping areas by offering free 30-minute parking or not . driving cars at 17 young germans have long eyed their peers in other countries with envy since german law says they can ’ t drive a car before the age of 18 .
that could soon change if the federal government agrees with a bundesrat decision to allow teenagers to get behind the wheel a year earlier .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .
more colors for cabs while taxi drivers didn ’ t demonstrate en mass in front of the bundesrat on friday , they still had strong opinions about a plan to do away with cab color restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light ivory 's no longer the only choice of color for german taxis .
for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .
government officials from the southwestern state of saarland , who pushed for the liberalization , said they will act swiftly to allow for more cab color variety . no more loopholes for clever sports managers germans of all hues were rubbed the wrong way recently when they discovered that soccer clubs such as borussia dortmund had managed to save a thousands of euros by making use of a loophole in germany ’ s tax system : by paying players tax-exempt overtime premiums for nighttime or weekend games , clubs could lower the base salaries they pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund players will no longer get tax-exempt overtime pay .
the tax exemption had been originally intended for low-paid workers such as nurses and policemen .
bundesrat members have now closed the loophole by limiting the tax exemption to people with monthly salaries of less than € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,600 -rrb- . free public parking as german municipalities struggle to fill budget holes caused by the weak economy , they ’ re bound to appreciate every euro that comes their way .
but as cities compete for customers in their downtown areas , some have started to question a federal law banning free short-term parking in spaces with parking meters . the bundesrat heard the complaints and decided to let municipalities decide for themselves whether they want to entice people to come to their urban shopping areas by offering free 30-minute parking or not . driving cars at 17 young germans have long eyed their peers in other countries with envy since german law says they can ’ t drive a car before the age of 18 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2003 dutch stand firm on coffee shops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ministers agreed on tough new anti-drug measures , the dutch took it all in stride .
after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .
sweden had also demanded the closure of the coffee shops , where people for over 30 years have been able to buy and smoke cannabis without fearing legal repercussions . " we have a situation where in certain conditions we will not prosecute and these conditions are kept very strictly , " dutch justice minister piet hein donner told reporters .
" this decision does not cover that policy . " but he added that the netherlands had agreed to increase its penalties for the possession of small quantities of soft drugs from one month to a year in those circumstances which carried a sentence . plans to restrict shops to locals although remaining firm that the coffee shops would remain open , donner made some concessions .
among them was the annoucement that the dutch government would continue with its plans to restrict coffee shop owners from selling soft drugs to non-residents in a bid to halt drug tourism in holland . despite the dutch commitment to keeping the coffee shops open , those present were relieved to have reached agreement on the range of new laws which will cover all types of drug dealing , ranging from local networks to large-scale international operations . " europe has now equipped itself with an instrument to combat drug trafficking , " italy ’ s castelli said , beaming with weary satisfaction after having admitted earlier that it would be extremely difficult to achieve consensus . longer jail terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the agreed rules , offering , selling or producing drugs should be sanctioned with maximum jail terms of at least one to three years if individuals are caught producing or distributing drugs or cultivating opium poppies , coca bush or cannabis plants .
in cases involving large-scale international drug trafficking , jail terms should be at least five to 10 years , according to the agreement . new threat from expansion many in the eu say such an agreement is needed in view of the bloc 's eastern expansion in 2004 .

after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .
sweden had also demanded the closure of the coffee shops , where people for over 30 years have been able to buy and smoke cannabis without fearing legal repercussions . " we have a situation where in certain conditions we will not prosecute and these conditions are kept very strictly , " dutch justice minister piet hein donner told reporters .
" this decision does not cover that policy . " but he added that the netherlands had agreed to increase its penalties for the possession of small quantities of soft drugs from one month to a year in those circumstances which carried a sentence . plans to restrict shops to locals although remaining firm that the coffee shops would remain open , donner made some concessions .
among them was the annoucement that the dutch government would continue with its plans to restrict coffee shop owners from selling soft drugs to non-residents in a bid to halt drug tourism in holland . despite the dutch commitment to keeping the coffee shops open , those present were relieved to have reached agreement on the range of new laws which will cover all types of drug dealing , ranging from local networks to large-scale international operations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2003 dutch stand firm on coffee shops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ministers agreed on tough new anti-drug measures , the dutch took it all in stride .
after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .
sweden had also demanded the closure of the coffee shops , where people for over 30 years have been able to buy and smoke cannabis without fearing legal repercussions . " we have a situation where in certain conditions we will not prosecute and these conditions are kept very strictly , " dutch justice minister piet hein donner told reporters .
" this decision does not cover that policy . " but he added that the netherlands had agreed to increase its penalties for the possession of small quantities of soft drugs from one month to a year in those circumstances which carried a sentence . plans to restrict shops to locals although remaining firm that the coffee shops would remain open , donner made some concessions .
among them was the annoucement that the dutch government would continue with its plans to restrict coffee shop owners from selling soft drugs to non-residents in a bid to halt drug tourism in holland . despite the dutch commitment to keeping the coffee shops open , those present were relieved to have reached agreement on the range of new laws which will cover all types of drug dealing , ranging from local networks to large-scale international operations . " europe has now equipped itself with an instrument to combat drug trafficking , " italy ’ s castelli said , beaming with weary satisfaction after having admitted earlier that it would be extremely difficult to achieve consensus . longer jail terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the agreed rules , offering , selling or producing drugs should be sanctioned with maximum jail terms of at least one to three years if individuals are caught producing or distributing drugs or cultivating opium poppies , coca bush or cannabis plants .
in cases involving large-scale international drug trafficking , jail terms should be at least five to 10 years , according to the agreement . new threat from expansion many in the eu say such an agreement is needed in view of the bloc 's eastern expansion in 2004 .
while the eu 's drug monitoring agency in lisbon reports that drug use inside the eu has been stabilizing after years of sharp increases , drug use has been rising in the 10 countries in central and eastern europe which will join the bloc next may . cnce considered simply transit areas for the movement of drugs to the eu , after accession the new member states will present traffickers with new and more lucrative markets . eu justice ministers say they hope that the severity of the new rules as well as the cross-border cooperation and harmonization will help combat the new threat and suppress the old . the agreed rules will now be passed to the european parliament for discussion .
if agreed upon there , the laws will enter into force 18 months after being formally approved by ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german and dutch ministers plan joint drug offensive german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .
more colors for cabs while taxi drivers didn ’ t demonstrate en mass in front of the bundesrat on friday , they still had strong opinions about a plan to do away with cab color restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light ivory 's no longer the only choice of color for german taxis .
for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .
government officials from the southwestern state of saarland , who pushed for the liberalization , said they will act swiftly to allow for more cab color variety . no more loopholes for clever sports managers germans of all hues were rubbed the wrong way recently when they discovered that soccer clubs such as borussia dortmund had managed to save a thousands of euros by making use of a loophole in germany ’ s tax system : by paying players tax-exempt overtime premiums for nighttime or weekend games , clubs could lower the base salaries they pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund players will no longer get tax-exempt overtime pay .
the tax exemption had been originally intended for low-paid workers such as nurses and policemen .
bundesrat members have now closed the loophole by limiting the tax exemption to people with monthly salaries of less than € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,600 -rrb- . free public parking as german municipalities struggle to fill budget holes caused by the weak economy , they ’ re bound to appreciate every euro that comes their way .
but as cities compete for customers in their downtown areas , some have started to question a federal law banning free short-term parking in spaces with parking meters . the bundesrat heard the complaints and decided to let municipalities decide for themselves whether they want to entice people to come to their urban shopping areas by offering free 30-minute parking or not . driving cars at 17 young germans have long eyed their peers in other countries with envy since german law says they can ’ t drive a car before the age of 18 .
that could soon change if the federal government agrees with a bundesrat decision to allow teenagers to get behind the wheel a year earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the bundesrat 's decision to lower the driving age , they 'll still be a little to young to drive a real beetle . the change in the law would require , however , that drivers under 18 be accompanied by an adult over the age of 30 .
proponents of the plan hope that the chaperoning would serve as an educational experience and help bring down the high accident rates among young drivers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cream-colored cabs soon a thing of the past ?
all german taxis have been cream-colored for more than two decades .
but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2003 dutch stand firm on coffee shops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ministers agreed on tough new anti-drug measures , the dutch took it all in stride .
after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .
sweden had also demanded the closure of the coffee shops , where people for over 30 years have been able to buy and smoke cannabis without fearing legal repercussions . " we have a situation where in certain conditions we will not prosecute and these conditions are kept very strictly , " dutch justice minister piet hein donner told reporters .
" this decision does not cover that policy . " but he added that the netherlands had agreed to increase its penalties for the possession of small quantities of soft drugs from one month to a year in those circumstances which carried a sentence . plans to restrict shops to locals although remaining firm that the coffee shops would remain open , donner made some concessions .
among them was the annoucement that the dutch government would continue with its plans to restrict coffee shop owners from selling soft drugs to non-residents in a bid to halt drug tourism in holland . despite the dutch commitment to keeping the coffee shops open , those present were relieved to have reached agreement on the range of new laws which will cover all types of drug dealing , ranging from local networks to large-scale international operations . " europe has now equipped itself with an instrument to combat drug trafficking , " italy ’ s castelli said , beaming with weary satisfaction after having admitted earlier that it would be extremely difficult to achieve consensus . longer jail terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the agreed rules , offering , selling or producing drugs should be sanctioned with maximum jail terms of at least one to three years if individuals are caught producing or distributing drugs or cultivating opium poppies , coca bush or cannabis plants .
in cases involving large-scale international drug trafficking , jail terms should be at least five to 10 years , according to the agreement . new threat from expansion many in the eu say such an agreement is needed in view of the bloc 's eastern expansion in 2004 .
while the eu 's drug monitoring agency in lisbon reports that drug use inside the eu has been stabilizing after years of sharp increases , drug use has been rising in the 10 countries in central and eastern europe which will join the bloc next may . cnce considered simply transit areas for the movement of drugs to the eu , after accession the new member states will present traffickers with new and more lucrative markets . eu justice ministers say they hope that the severity of the new rules as well as the cross-border cooperation and harmonization will help combat the new threat and suppress the old . the agreed rules will now be passed to the european parliament for discussion .
if agreed upon there , the laws will enter into force 18 months after being formally approved by ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german and dutch ministers plan joint drug offensive german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis .

cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .

a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.11.2003 fashion , power and women ’ s rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long hours , low or no pay : a living hell for these vietnamese seamstresses .
cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

but for everyday use , german car-owners prefer japanese cars to the legendary names of their native country .
the stunning news is the result of two surveys conducted separately by car magazine autobild and german car-insurer adac .
the so-called automarxx survey , conducted by adac with the center for automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , asked more than 38,000 car owners to rank international car companies in terms of consumer satisfaction .
the german automobile industry 's first entry on the list is porsche at number eight .
toyota and honda lead a pack of asian rivals in the first seven spots .
the study , which will first be released to the public next week , is sure to disappoint the likes of mercedes and audi , who apparently enjoy a better reputation abroad than at home .
not even in the top five covering a range of areas from company strength and market position to design and environmental friendliness , the latest automarxx survey is the first to feature a consumer satisfaction section .
the consumer questionnaires looked at both the products and service of 33 manufacturers , and included ratings of electronics , motor power and comfort as well as of cost and standards of garage work .
while german brands mercedes , bmw , audi , volkswagen and porsche still occupy the top five of the overall rating section , they barely figure in the consumer satisfaction top ten , beaten by toyota at number one , followed by other asian competitors such as subaru , honda and mazda .

speaking from the essen motor show , which opened on thursday , mazda 's peter tuhl told deutsche welle that mazda 's position in the top five reflected the japanese company 's enduringly high technical standards .
he said a mazda owner experiences " lasting satisfaction . "
a german car owner , on the other hand , is more like a " disappointed lover who realizes the first promises are n't going to come true " .
the survey results seem to back up the mark .
mercedes has no problem with its image , but rather with its follow-through , according to the results .
dr. ferdinand dudenhöffer , who led the survey , said the emphasis german companies like mercedes place on innovation comes at the expense of production quality .
" every technical innovation increases the risk of a break-down , " he says . " in this respect , toyota is more conservative , which may not be good for its image , but is very beneficial in terms of reliability . "

after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .
sweden had also demanded the closure of the coffee shops , where people for over 30 years have been able to buy and smoke cannabis without fearing legal repercussions . " we have a situation where in certain conditions we will not prosecute and these conditions are kept very strictly , " dutch justice minister piet hein donner told reporters .
" this decision does not cover that policy . " but he added that the netherlands had agreed to increase its penalties for the possession of small quantities of soft drugs from one month to a year in those circumstances which carried a sentence . plans to restrict shops to locals although remaining firm that the coffee shops would remain open , donner made some concessions .
among them was the annoucement that the dutch government would continue with its plans to restrict coffee shop owners from selling soft drugs to non-residents in a bid to halt drug tourism in holland . despite the dutch commitment to keeping the coffee shops open , those present were relieved to have reached agreement on the range of new laws which will cover all types of drug dealing , ranging from local networks to large-scale international operations .

germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer : der kaiser of austria .
it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .
eichel makes a stand finance minister hans eichel was among the first into the fray last month when he criticized the cream of germany ’ s sporting heroes on a television talk show .
“ i ’ m not among the fans of people like boris becker , michael schumacher and franz beckenbauer , ” eichel said in an attack on those who have moved to switzerland and austria , where taxes are lower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : show me the money !
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker has had a taxing time .
it may be too much to expect a permanent return from boris becker , who was badly burned last year when a munich court convicted him of tax evasion and ordered him to pay a € 600,000 -lrb- $ 714,000 -rrb- fine .
it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .
fellow cross-border dwellers such as former wimbledon champion michael stich and champion speed skater anni friesinger are also happy to remain in austria while former tour de france champion jan ullrich has only just finished unpacking after he moved from the black forest to switzerland last year .
as for the racing schumacher brothers , the latest outburst from the government can not come as too much of a surprise , especially to ralf .
while his more successful and tactful brother michael keeps a low profile on his swiss farm , baby schumi has faced heated criticism since moving to salzburg in austria .

but for everyday use , german car-owners prefer japanese cars to the legendary names of their native country .
the stunning news is the result of two surveys conducted separately by car magazine autobild and german car-insurer adac .
the so-called automarxx survey , conducted by adac with the center for automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , asked more than 38,000 car owners to rank international car companies in terms of consumer satisfaction .
the german automobile industry 's first entry on the list is porsche at number eight .
toyota and honda lead a pack of asian rivals in the first seven spots .
the study , which will first be released to the public next week , is sure to disappoint the likes of mercedes and audi , who apparently enjoy a better reputation abroad than at home .
not even in the top five covering a range of areas from company strength and market position to design and environmental friendliness , the latest automarxx survey is the first to feature a consumer satisfaction section .
the consumer questionnaires looked at both the products and service of 33 manufacturers , and included ratings of electronics , motor power and comfort as well as of cost and standards of garage work .
while german brands mercedes , bmw , audi , volkswagen and porsche still occupy the top five of the overall rating section , they barely figure in the consumer satisfaction top ten , beaten by toyota at number one , followed by other asian competitors such as subaru , honda and mazda .
quality over image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auto mazda , autoshow in detroit , 2004 mazda rx-8 the competition is not surprised by the results .
speaking from the essen motor show , which opened on thursday , mazda 's peter tuhl told deutsche welle that mazda 's position in the top five reflected the japanese company 's enduringly high technical standards .
he said a mazda owner experiences " lasting satisfaction . "
a german car owner , on the other hand , is more like a " disappointed lover who realizes the first promises are n't going to come true " .
the survey results seem to back up the mark .
mercedes has no problem with its image , but rather with its follow-through , according to the results .
dr. ferdinand dudenhöffer , who led the survey , said the emphasis german companies like mercedes place on innovation comes at the expense of production quality .
" every technical innovation increases the risk of a break-down , " he says . " in this respect , toyota is more conservative , which may not be good for its image , but is very beneficial in terms of reliability . "
" made in germany " loses clout the autobild survey confirms the trend .
the first german entry on the list is bmw at number five , again trumped by asian rivals .
vw ceo dr. bernd pischetsrieder admitted to autobild that " in technical terms , toyota is better then us .
but not just us . "
the results of the automarxx survey are a blow to stuttgart-based mercedes in particular , which comes in at an astonishingly low number 32 .
other german manufacturers fared equally badly , with volkswagen at number 31 and opel only four places higher . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de motor show optimism spreads to market the guarded optimism that surrounded the frankfurt motor show last month is proving to be well founded .

"
germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer : der kaiser of austria .
it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .
eichel makes a stand finance minister hans eichel was among the first into the fray last month when he criticized the cream of germany ’ s sporting heroes on a television talk show .
“ i ’ m not among the fans of people like boris becker , michael schumacher and franz beckenbauer , ” eichel said in an attack on those who have moved to switzerland and austria , where taxes are lower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : show me the money !
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker has had a taxing time .
it may be too much to expect a permanent return from boris becker , who was badly burned last year when a munich court convicted him of tax evasion and ordered him to pay a € 600,000 -lrb- $ 714,000 -rrb- fine .
it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .
fellow cross-border dwellers such as former wimbledon champion michael stich and champion speed skater anni friesinger are also happy to remain in austria while former tour de france champion jan ullrich has only just finished unpacking after he moved from the black forest to switzerland last year .
as for the racing schumacher brothers , the latest outburst from the government can not come as too much of a surprise , especially to ralf .
while his more successful and tactful brother michael keeps a low profile on his swiss farm , baby schumi has faced heated criticism since moving to salzburg in austria .
taxation jungle his cause was not helped by remarks he made last year which disparaged his home country .
“ germany is simply a taxation jungle , ” the younger schumacher said .
“ i don ’ t feel like having tax collectors on my heels .
i don ’ t want to be hunted down like boris becker or steffi graf .
that ’ s why i used the chance to go abroad for tax reasons . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's sporting heroes profit from successful year thanks to the sporting heroes who have contributed to one of the country 's most successful years for sport , things are n't all doom and gloom in germany .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .
more colors for cabs while taxi drivers didn ’ t demonstrate en mass in front of the bundesrat on friday , they still had strong opinions about a plan to do away with cab color restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light ivory 's no longer the only choice of color for german taxis .
for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .
government officials from the southwestern state of saarland , who pushed for the liberalization , said they will act swiftly to allow for more cab color variety . no more loopholes for clever sports managers germans of all hues were rubbed the wrong way recently when they discovered that soccer clubs such as borussia dortmund had managed to save a thousands of euros by making use of a loophole in germany ’ s tax system : by paying players tax-exempt overtime premiums for nighttime or weekend games , clubs could lower the base salaries they pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund players will no longer get tax-exempt overtime pay .
the tax exemption had been originally intended for low-paid workers such as nurses and policemen .
bundesrat members have now closed the loophole by limiting the tax exemption to people with monthly salaries of less than € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,600 -rrb- . free public parking as german municipalities struggle to fill budget holes caused by the weak economy , they ’ re bound to appreciate every euro that comes their way .
but as cities compete for customers in their downtown areas , some have started to question a federal law banning free short-term parking in spaces with parking meters . the bundesrat heard the complaints and decided to let municipalities decide for themselves whether they want to entice people to come to their urban shopping areas by offering free 30-minute parking or not . driving cars at 17 young germans have long eyed their peers in other countries with envy since german law says they can ’ t drive a car before the age of 18 .
that could soon change if the federal government agrees with a bundesrat decision to allow teenagers to get behind the wheel a year earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the bundesrat 's decision to lower the driving age , they 'll still be a little to young to drive a real beetle . the change in the law would require , however , that drivers under 18 be accompanied by an adult over the age of 30 .
proponents of the plan hope that the chaperoning would serve as an educational experience and help bring down the high accident rates among young drivers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cream-colored cabs soon a thing of the past ?
all german taxis have been cream-colored for more than two decades .
but that uniformity could change if germany 's upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , votes in favor of lifting the color restrictions .

crushing the hopes of an entire region for economic recovery , the operating company of a proposed chip plant in eastern germany announced on friday that it will declare bankruptcy . the investors had already backed off and the federal government was showing no signs of making a last-ditch effort to save construction of the plant .
but a spokesman for the factor 's operating company on friday said there was still a slim chance that the project 's demise could be avoided : “ the board of directors still hasn ’ t signed the papers -lrb- to file for insolvency . -rrb- " the chip factory ’ s fate had already seemed sealed on thursday after government officials from the german state of brandenburg , who had supported the project with public funds , said that only the federal government could still salvage the plant . investors fail to give more money ever since its announcement three years ago , financing for the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project has been uncertain .
things came to a head when the plant ’ s biggest investor , the arab emirate of dubai , failed to hand over a payment of € 89 million in early november . the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million , didn ’ t send the money as it was waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million loan . brandenburg itself had given € 40 million to build the plant , which was intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , contributed the same amount . the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . need for new eu approval final straw a smaller plant would have required operating company communicant to file a completely new application for funds with the eu commission , setting back the project an additional six months , brandenburg ’ s former premier , manfred stolpe told german public television .
this additional delay had finally caused investors to jump ship , said stolpe , now responsible for pushing east german revitalization in the schröder government . his successor , matthias platzeck , had previously criticized stolpe for presenting the project as a sure thing three years ago .
stolpe countered that the chip plant ’ s financing had seemed solid at the time . the chip plant ’ s demise shocked residents of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the town at the german-polish border where the factory building ’ s shell had slowly risen over the past years . the area struggles with some of germany ’ s highest unemployment rates and people there saw the factory as a last hope for economic recovery .
about 1,300 jobs would have been created if the plant had been finished . third on a list of bad investments the chip plant became the third massive project with public investments in brandenburg to go belly up .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , filed for bankruptcy . state government officials hope to salvage the speedway by offering millions of euros in subsidies to a leaseholder .

crushing the hopes of an entire region for economic recovery , the operating company of a proposed chip plant in eastern germany announced on friday that it will declare bankruptcy . the investors had already backed off and the federal government was showing no signs of making a last-ditch effort to save construction of the plant .
but a spokesman for the factor 's operating company on friday said there was still a slim chance that the project 's demise could be avoided : “ the board of directors still hasn ’ t signed the papers -lrb- to file for insolvency . -rrb- " the chip factory ’ s fate had already seemed sealed on thursday after government officials from the german state of brandenburg , who had supported the project with public funds , said that only the federal government could still salvage the plant . investors fail to give more money ever since its announcement three years ago , financing for the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project has been uncertain .
things came to a head when the plant ’ s biggest investor , the arab emirate of dubai , failed to hand over a payment of € 89 million in early november . the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million , didn ’ t send the money as it was waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million loan . brandenburg itself had given € 40 million to build the plant , which was intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , contributed the same amount . the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . need for new eu approval final straw a smaller plant would have required operating company communicant to file a completely new application for funds with the eu commission , setting back the project an additional six months , brandenburg ’ s former premier , manfred stolpe told german public television .
this additional delay had finally caused investors to jump ship , said stolpe , now responsible for pushing east german revitalization in the schröder government . his successor , matthias platzeck , had previously criticized stolpe for presenting the project as a sure thing three years ago .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .

for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .
government officials from the southwestern state of saarland , who pushed for the liberalization , said they will act swiftly to allow for more cab color variety . no more loopholes for clever sports managers germans of all hues were rubbed the wrong way recently when they discovered that soccer clubs such as borussia dortmund had managed to save a thousands of euros by making use of a loophole in germany ’ s tax system : by paying players tax-exempt overtime premiums for nighttime or weekend games , clubs could lower the base salaries they pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund players will no longer get tax-exempt overtime pay .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2003 dutch stand firm on coffee shops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ministers agreed on tough new anti-drug measures , the dutch took it all in stride .
after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .
sweden had also demanded the closure of the coffee shops , where people for over 30 years have been able to buy and smoke cannabis without fearing legal repercussions . " we have a situation where in certain conditions we will not prosecute and these conditions are kept very strictly , " dutch justice minister piet hein donner told reporters .
" this decision does not cover that policy . " but he added that the netherlands had agreed to increase its penalties for the possession of small quantities of soft drugs from one month to a year in those circumstances which carried a sentence . plans to restrict shops to locals although remaining firm that the coffee shops would remain open , donner made some concessions .
among them was the annoucement that the dutch government would continue with its plans to restrict coffee shop owners from selling soft drugs to non-residents in a bid to halt drug tourism in holland . despite the dutch commitment to keeping the coffee shops open , those present were relieved to have reached agreement on the range of new laws which will cover all types of drug dealing , ranging from local networks to large-scale international operations .

after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .
sweden had also demanded the closure of the coffee shops , where people for over 30 years have been able to buy and smoke cannabis without fearing legal repercussions . " we have a situation where in certain conditions we will not prosecute and these conditions are kept very strictly , " dutch justice minister piet hein donner told reporters .
" this decision does not cover that policy . " but he added that the netherlands had agreed to increase its penalties for the possession of small quantities of soft drugs from one month to a year in those circumstances which carried a sentence . plans to restrict shops to locals although remaining firm that the coffee shops would remain open , donner made some concessions .
among them was the annoucement that the dutch government would continue with its plans to restrict coffee shop owners from selling soft drugs to non-residents in a bid to halt drug tourism in holland . despite the dutch commitment to keeping the coffee shops open , those present were relieved to have reached agreement on the range of new laws which will cover all types of drug dealing , ranging from local networks to large-scale international operations .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .

"
germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer : der kaiser of austria .
it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .
eichel makes a stand finance minister hans eichel was among the first into the fray last month when he criticized the cream of germany ’ s sporting heroes on a television talk show .
“ i ’ m not among the fans of people like boris becker , michael schumacher and franz beckenbauer , ” eichel said in an attack on those who have moved to switzerland and austria , where taxes are lower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : show me the money !
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker has had a taxing time .
it may be too much to expect a permanent return from boris becker , who was badly burned last year when a munich court convicted him of tax evasion and ordered him to pay a € 600,000 -lrb- $ 714,000 -rrb- fine .
it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .
fellow cross-border dwellers such as former wimbledon champion michael stich and champion speed skater anni friesinger are also happy to remain in austria while former tour de france champion jan ullrich has only just finished unpacking after he moved from the black forest to switzerland last year .
as for the racing schumacher brothers , the latest outburst from the government can not come as too much of a surprise , especially to ralf .
while his more successful and tactful brother michael keeps a low profile on his swiss farm , baby schumi has faced heated criticism since moving to salzburg in austria .
taxation jungle his cause was not helped by remarks he made last year which disparaged his home country .
“ germany is simply a taxation jungle , ” the younger schumacher said .
“ i don ’ t feel like having tax collectors on my heels .
i don ’ t want to be hunted down like boris becker or steffi graf .
that ’ s why i used the chance to go abroad for tax reasons . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's sporting heroes profit from successful year thanks to the sporting heroes who have contributed to one of the country 's most successful years for sport , things are n't all doom and gloom in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.11.2003 death blow for chip factory project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the chip factory 's half-finished building ever be completed ?
crushing the hopes of an entire region for economic recovery , the operating company of a proposed chip plant in eastern germany announced on friday that it will declare bankruptcy . the investors had already backed off and the federal government was showing no signs of making a last-ditch effort to save construction of the plant .
but a spokesman for the factor 's operating company on friday said there was still a slim chance that the project 's demise could be avoided : “ the board of directors still hasn ’ t signed the papers -lrb- to file for insolvency . -rrb- " the chip factory ’ s fate had already seemed sealed on thursday after government officials from the german state of brandenburg , who had supported the project with public funds , said that only the federal government could still salvage the plant . investors fail to give more money ever since its announcement three years ago , financing for the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project has been uncertain .
things came to a head when the plant ’ s biggest investor , the arab emirate of dubai , failed to hand over a payment of € 89 million in early november . the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million , didn ’ t send the money as it was waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million loan . brandenburg itself had given € 40 million to build the plant , which was intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , contributed the same amount . the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . need for new eu approval final straw a smaller plant would have required operating company communicant to file a completely new application for funds with the eu commission , setting back the project an additional six months , brandenburg ’ s former premier , manfred stolpe told german public television .
this additional delay had finally caused investors to jump ship , said stolpe , now responsible for pushing east german revitalization in the schröder government . his successor , matthias platzeck , had previously criticized stolpe for presenting the project as a sure thing three years ago .
stolpe countered that the chip plant ’ s financing had seemed solid at the time . the chip plant ’ s demise shocked residents of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the town at the german-polish border where the factory building ’ s shell had slowly risen over the past years . the area struggles with some of germany ’ s highest unemployment rates and people there saw the factory as a last hope for economic recovery .
about 1,300 jobs would have been created if the plant had been finished . third on a list of bad investments the chip plant became the third massive project with public investments in brandenburg to go belly up .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , filed for bankruptcy . state government officials hope to salvage the speedway by offering millions of euros in subsidies to a leaseholder .
a private consortium plans to fill cargolifter ’ s giant construction hall with the world ’ s largest indoor rain forest and open an amusement and water park there by oct .

crushing the hopes of an entire region for economic recovery , the operating company of a proposed chip plant in eastern germany announced on friday that it will declare bankruptcy . the investors had already backed off and the federal government was showing no signs of making a last-ditch effort to save construction of the plant .
but a spokesman for the factor 's operating company on friday said there was still a slim chance that the project 's demise could be avoided : “ the board of directors still hasn ’ t signed the papers -lrb- to file for insolvency . -rrb- " the chip factory ’ s fate had already seemed sealed on thursday after government officials from the german state of brandenburg , who had supported the project with public funds , said that only the federal government could still salvage the plant . investors fail to give more money ever since its announcement three years ago , financing for the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project has been uncertain .
things came to a head when the plant ’ s biggest investor , the arab emirate of dubai , failed to hand over a payment of € 89 million in early november . the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million , didn ’ t send the money as it was waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million loan . brandenburg itself had given € 40 million to build the plant , which was intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , contributed the same amount . the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . need for new eu approval final straw a smaller plant would have required operating company communicant to file a completely new application for funds with the eu commission , setting back the project an additional six months , brandenburg ’ s former premier , manfred stolpe told german public television .
this additional delay had finally caused investors to jump ship , said stolpe , now responsible for pushing east german revitalization in the schröder government . his successor , matthias platzeck , had previously criticized stolpe for presenting the project as a sure thing three years ago .
stolpe countered that the chip plant ’ s financing had seemed solid at the time . the chip plant ’ s demise shocked residents of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the town at the german-polish border where the factory building ’ s shell had slowly risen over the past years . the area struggles with some of germany ’ s highest unemployment rates and people there saw the factory as a last hope for economic recovery .
about 1,300 jobs would have been created if the plant had been finished . third on a list of bad investments the chip plant became the third massive project with public investments in brandenburg to go belly up .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , filed for bankruptcy . state government officials hope to salvage the speedway by offering millions of euros in subsidies to a leaseholder .
a private consortium plans to fill cargolifter ’ s giant construction hall with the world ’ s largest indoor rain forest and open an amusement and water park there by oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 28.11.2003 chicken in the upper house großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite defeat in the bunderat , german agriculture minister vowed to keep fighting for free-range eggs .
cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .
more colors for cabs while taxi drivers didn ’ t demonstrate en mass in front of the bundesrat on friday , they still had strong opinions about a plan to do away with cab color restrictions .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.11.2003 fashion , power and women ’ s rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long hours , low or no pay : a living hell for these vietnamese seamstresses .
cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.11.2003 german cars disappoint car owners großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luxury car mercedes does n't inspire the same consumer confidence it used to mercedes and bmw for all their glamour , are n't the preferred choice of german car-owners , according to two surprising new surveys released this week . when it comes to overall ratings , nothing tops the charts like a mercedes benz .
but for everyday use , german car-owners prefer japanese cars to the legendary names of their native country .
the stunning news is the result of two surveys conducted separately by car magazine autobild and german car-insurer adac .
the so-called automarxx survey , conducted by adac with the center for automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , asked more than 38,000 car owners to rank international car companies in terms of consumer satisfaction .
the german automobile industry 's first entry on the list is porsche at number eight .
toyota and honda lead a pack of asian rivals in the first seven spots .
the study , which will first be released to the public next week , is sure to disappoint the likes of mercedes and audi , who apparently enjoy a better reputation abroad than at home .

germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer : der kaiser of austria .
it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .
eichel makes a stand finance minister hans eichel was among the first into the fray last month when he criticized the cream of germany ’ s sporting heroes on a television talk show .
“ i ’ m not among the fans of people like boris becker , michael schumacher and franz beckenbauer , ” eichel said in an attack on those who have moved to switzerland and austria , where taxes are lower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : show me the money !
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker has had a taxing time .
it may be too much to expect a permanent return from boris becker , who was badly burned last year when a munich court convicted him of tax evasion and ordered him to pay a € 600,000 -lrb- $ 714,000 -rrb- fine .
it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .
fellow cross-border dwellers such as former wimbledon champion michael stich and champion speed skater anni friesinger are also happy to remain in austria while former tour de france champion jan ullrich has only just finished unpacking after he moved from the black forest to switzerland last year .
as for the racing schumacher brothers , the latest outburst from the government can not come as too much of a surprise , especially to ralf .
while his more successful and tactful brother michael keeps a low profile on his swiss farm , baby schumi has faced heated criticism since moving to salzburg in austria .
taxation jungle his cause was not helped by remarks he made last year which disparaged his home country .
“ germany is simply a taxation jungle , ” the younger schumacher said .
“ i don ’ t feel like having tax collectors on my heels .
i don ’ t want to be hunted down like boris becker or steffi graf .
that ’ s why i used the chance to go abroad for tax reasons . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's sporting heroes profit from successful year thanks to the sporting heroes who have contributed to one of the country 's most successful years for sport , things are n't all doom and gloom in germany .

cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "

a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer : der kaiser of austria .
it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .
eichel makes a stand finance minister hans eichel was among the first into the fray last month when he criticized the cream of germany ’ s sporting heroes on a television talk show .
“ i ’ m not among the fans of people like boris becker , michael schumacher and franz beckenbauer , ” eichel said in an attack on those who have moved to switzerland and austria , where taxes are lower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : show me the money !
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker has had a taxing time .
it may be too much to expect a permanent return from boris becker , who was badly burned last year when a munich court convicted him of tax evasion and ordered him to pay a € 600,000 -lrb- $ 714,000 -rrb- fine .
it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .
fellow cross-border dwellers such as former wimbledon champion michael stich and champion speed skater anni friesinger are also happy to remain in austria while former tour de france champion jan ullrich has only just finished unpacking after he moved from the black forest to switzerland last year .
as for the racing schumacher brothers , the latest outburst from the government can not come as too much of a surprise , especially to ralf .
while his more successful and tactful brother michael keeps a low profile on his swiss farm , baby schumi has faced heated criticism since moving to salzburg in austria .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2003 dutch stand firm on coffee shops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ministers agreed on tough new anti-drug measures , the dutch took it all in stride .
after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .

police in hamburg have arrested an algerian suspected of being the ringleader of a network of al qaeda activitists who allegedly have been recruiting extremists in europe to carry out suicide attacks in iraq . the man , identified by as abderrazak mahdjoub , 29 , an algerian also known as “ the sheikh , ” was arrested on friday morning in this northern port city on the request of italian authorities , who are requesting he be handed over to them . “ he has been arrested on the basis of an italian investigation and been taken into custody pending extradition , ” marion zippel , a senior prosecutor in the hamburg prosecutor ’ s office , told reuters . mahdjoub is suspected of being the leader of a group of recruiters active in europe looking for people to travel to iraq to carry out suicide bombings .
one of the recruits , according to the arrest warrant , was suspected of involvement in the rocket attack in october on a baghdad hotel where u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz was staying . mahdjoub is also thought to have had contacts with the hamburg-based terror cell which carried out the sept .
11 attacks in the u.s. hamburg police had arrested mahdjoub in july on suspicion of plotting to bomb attack in spain , but he was released several months later for lack of evidence . the chief of germany 's foreign intelligence unit , august hanning , described iraq last week as a " crystallizing point " for the radical islamist cause .
he said activists were heading there from european countries to fight the u.s. occupation . in april , police said dozens of islamic extremists were being approached by recruiters in italy and germany .
they were then sent to training camps in syria before going to iraq to join a group with links to al qaeda . italian dragnet the arrest in hamburg was part of a larger italian-led anti-terror sweep carried out on thursday and friday .
prosecutors in milan had issued arrest warrants for five individuals suspected of being part of the terror cell .
all five were charged with association with the aim of international terrorism . italian police arrested two north africans in milan , also suspected of being members of the recruiting group .
they have been identified as housni jamal , 20 , of morocco and bouyahia maher ben abdelaziz , 33 , of tunisia . two others - an iraqi man and a tunisian woman - remain at large , the interior ministry in rome told the associated press .
the iraqi is suspected of having fled to syria while the woman is thought to have returned to her home country . the ministry confirmed earlier reports that a sixth man , a tunisian national , was arrested on saturday for allegedly providing assistance to the terror cell . since suicide bombers killed 19 italians in southern iraq earlier this month , italy has cracked down on people suspected of having links to terror networks .
rome recently expelled seven north africans accused of having links with militant groups and an imam from senegal who publicly expressed support for osama bin laden . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2003 dutch stand firm on coffee shops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ministers agreed on tough new anti-drug measures , the dutch took it all in stride .
after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .
sweden had also demanded the closure of the coffee shops , where people for over 30 years have been able to buy and smoke cannabis without fearing legal repercussions . " we have a situation where in certain conditions we will not prosecute and these conditions are kept very strictly , " dutch justice minister piet hein donner told reporters .
" this decision does not cover that policy . " but he added that the netherlands had agreed to increase its penalties for the possession of small quantities of soft drugs from one month to a year in those circumstances which carried a sentence . plans to restrict shops to locals although remaining firm that the coffee shops would remain open , donner made some concessions .
among them was the annoucement that the dutch government would continue with its plans to restrict coffee shop owners from selling soft drugs to non-residents in a bid to halt drug tourism in holland . despite the dutch commitment to keeping the coffee shops open , those present were relieved to have reached agreement on the range of new laws which will cover all types of drug dealing , ranging from local networks to large-scale international operations . " europe has now equipped itself with an instrument to combat drug trafficking , " italy ’ s castelli said , beaming with weary satisfaction after having admitted earlier that it would be extremely difficult to achieve consensus . longer jail terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the agreed rules , offering , selling or producing drugs should be sanctioned with maximum jail terms of at least one to three years if individuals are caught producing or distributing drugs or cultivating opium poppies , coca bush or cannabis plants .
in cases involving large-scale international drug trafficking , jail terms should be at least five to 10 years , according to the agreement . new threat from expansion many in the eu say such an agreement is needed in view of the bloc 's eastern expansion in 2004 .
while the eu 's drug monitoring agency in lisbon reports that drug use inside the eu has been stabilizing after years of sharp increases , drug use has been rising in the 10 countries in central and eastern europe which will join the bloc next may . cnce considered simply transit areas for the movement of drugs to the eu , after accession the new member states will present traffickers with new and more lucrative markets . eu justice ministers say they hope that the severity of the new rules as well as the cross-border cooperation and harmonization will help combat the new threat and suppress the old . the agreed rules will now be passed to the european parliament for discussion .
if agreed upon there , the laws will enter into force 18 months after being formally approved by ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german and dutch ministers plan joint drug offensive german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis .

"
germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer : der kaiser of austria .
it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .
eichel makes a stand finance minister hans eichel was among the first into the fray last month when he criticized the cream of germany ’ s sporting heroes on a television talk show .
“ i ’ m not among the fans of people like boris becker , michael schumacher and franz beckenbauer , ” eichel said in an attack on those who have moved to switzerland and austria , where taxes are lower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : show me the money !
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker has had a taxing time .
it may be too much to expect a permanent return from boris becker , who was badly burned last year when a munich court convicted him of tax evasion and ordered him to pay a € 600,000 -lrb- $ 714,000 -rrb- fine .
it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .
fellow cross-border dwellers such as former wimbledon champion michael stich and champion speed skater anni friesinger are also happy to remain in austria while former tour de france champion jan ullrich has only just finished unpacking after he moved from the black forest to switzerland last year .
as for the racing schumacher brothers , the latest outburst from the government can not come as too much of a surprise , especially to ralf .
while his more successful and tactful brother michael keeps a low profile on his swiss farm , baby schumi has faced heated criticism since moving to salzburg in austria .
taxation jungle his cause was not helped by remarks he made last year which disparaged his home country .
“ germany is simply a taxation jungle , ” the younger schumacher said .

but for everyday use , german car-owners prefer japanese cars to the legendary names of their native country .
the stunning news is the result of two surveys conducted separately by car magazine autobild and german car-insurer adac .
the so-called automarxx survey , conducted by adac with the center for automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , asked more than 38,000 car owners to rank international car companies in terms of consumer satisfaction .
the german automobile industry 's first entry on the list is porsche at number eight .
toyota and honda lead a pack of asian rivals in the first seven spots .
the study , which will first be released to the public next week , is sure to disappoint the likes of mercedes and audi , who apparently enjoy a better reputation abroad than at home .
not even in the top five covering a range of areas from company strength and market position to design and environmental friendliness , the latest automarxx survey is the first to feature a consumer satisfaction section .
the consumer questionnaires looked at both the products and service of 33 manufacturers , and included ratings of electronics , motor power and comfort as well as of cost and standards of garage work .
while german brands mercedes , bmw , audi , volkswagen and porsche still occupy the top five of the overall rating section , they barely figure in the consumer satisfaction top ten , beaten by toyota at number one , followed by other asian competitors such as subaru , honda and mazda .
quality over image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auto mazda , autoshow in detroit , 2004 mazda rx-8 the competition is not surprised by the results .
speaking from the essen motor show , which opened on thursday , mazda 's peter tuhl told deutsche welle that mazda 's position in the top five reflected the japanese company 's enduringly high technical standards .
he said a mazda owner experiences " lasting satisfaction . "
a german car owner , on the other hand , is more like a " disappointed lover who realizes the first promises are n't going to come true " .
the survey results seem to back up the mark .
mercedes has no problem with its image , but rather with its follow-through , according to the results .
dr. ferdinand dudenhöffer , who led the survey , said the emphasis german companies like mercedes place on innovation comes at the expense of production quality .
" every technical innovation increases the risk of a break-down , " he says . " in this respect , toyota is more conservative , which may not be good for its image , but is very beneficial in terms of reliability . "
" made in germany " loses clout the autobild survey confirms the trend .
the first german entry on the list is bmw at number five , again trumped by asian rivals .
vw ceo dr. bernd pischetsrieder admitted to autobild that " in technical terms , toyota is better then us .
but not just us . "
the results of the automarxx survey are a blow to stuttgart-based mercedes in particular , which comes in at an astonishingly low number 32 .
other german manufacturers fared equally badly , with volkswagen at number 31 and opel only four places higher . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de motor show optimism spreads to market the guarded optimism that surrounded the frankfurt motor show last month is proving to be well founded .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .
more colors for cabs while taxi drivers didn ’ t demonstrate en mass in front of the bundesrat on friday , they still had strong opinions about a plan to do away with cab color restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light ivory 's no longer the only choice of color for german taxis .
for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .

"
germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer : der kaiser of austria .
it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .
eichel makes a stand finance minister hans eichel was among the first into the fray last month when he criticized the cream of germany ’ s sporting heroes on a television talk show .
“ i ’ m not among the fans of people like boris becker , michael schumacher and franz beckenbauer , ” eichel said in an attack on those who have moved to switzerland and austria , where taxes are lower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : show me the money !
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker has had a taxing time .
it may be too much to expect a permanent return from boris becker , who was badly burned last year when a munich court convicted him of tax evasion and ordered him to pay a € 600,000 -lrb- $ 714,000 -rrb- fine .
it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .
fellow cross-border dwellers such as former wimbledon champion michael stich and champion speed skater anni friesinger are also happy to remain in austria while former tour de france champion jan ullrich has only just finished unpacking after he moved from the black forest to switzerland last year .
as for the racing schumacher brothers , the latest outburst from the government can not come as too much of a surprise , especially to ralf .
while his more successful and tactful brother michael keeps a low profile on his swiss farm , baby schumi has faced heated criticism since moving to salzburg in austria .
taxation jungle his cause was not helped by remarks he made last year which disparaged his home country .
“ germany is simply a taxation jungle , ” the younger schumacher said .
“ i don ’ t feel like having tax collectors on my heels .

germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer : der kaiser of austria .
it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .
eichel makes a stand finance minister hans eichel was among the first into the fray last month when he criticized the cream of germany ’ s sporting heroes on a television talk show .
“ i ’ m not among the fans of people like boris becker , michael schumacher and franz beckenbauer , ” eichel said in an attack on those who have moved to switzerland and austria , where taxes are lower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : show me the money !
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker has had a taxing time .
it may be too much to expect a permanent return from boris becker , who was badly burned last year when a munich court convicted him of tax evasion and ordered him to pay a € 600,000 -lrb- $ 714,000 -rrb- fine .
it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .
fellow cross-border dwellers such as former wimbledon champion michael stich and champion speed skater anni friesinger are also happy to remain in austria while former tour de france champion jan ullrich has only just finished unpacking after he moved from the black forest to switzerland last year .
as for the racing schumacher brothers , the latest outburst from the government can not come as too much of a surprise , especially to ralf .
while his more successful and tactful brother michael keeps a low profile on his swiss farm , baby schumi has faced heated criticism since moving to salzburg in austria .
taxation jungle his cause was not helped by remarks he made last year which disparaged his home country .
“ germany is simply a taxation jungle , ” the younger schumacher said .
“ i don ’ t feel like having tax collectors on my heels .
i don ’ t want to be hunted down like boris becker or steffi graf .

police in hamburg have arrested an algerian suspected of being the ringleader of a network of al qaeda activitists who allegedly have been recruiting extremists in europe to carry out suicide attacks in iraq . the man , identified by as abderrazak mahdjoub , 29 , an algerian also known as “ the sheikh , ” was arrested on friday morning in this northern port city on the request of italian authorities , who are requesting he be handed over to them . “ he has been arrested on the basis of an italian investigation and been taken into custody pending extradition , ” marion zippel , a senior prosecutor in the hamburg prosecutor ’ s office , told reuters . mahdjoub is suspected of being the leader of a group of recruiters active in europe looking for people to travel to iraq to carry out suicide bombings .
one of the recruits , according to the arrest warrant , was suspected of involvement in the rocket attack in october on a baghdad hotel where u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz was staying . mahdjoub is also thought to have had contacts with the hamburg-based terror cell which carried out the sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.11.2003 fashion , power and women ’ s rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long hours , low or no pay : a living hell for these vietnamese seamstresses .
cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

but for everyday use , german car-owners prefer japanese cars to the legendary names of their native country .
the stunning news is the result of two surveys conducted separately by car magazine autobild and german car-insurer adac .
the so-called automarxx survey , conducted by adac with the center for automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , asked more than 38,000 car owners to rank international car companies in terms of consumer satisfaction .
the german automobile industry 's first entry on the list is porsche at number eight .
toyota and honda lead a pack of asian rivals in the first seven spots .
the study , which will first be released to the public next week , is sure to disappoint the likes of mercedes and audi , who apparently enjoy a better reputation abroad than at home .
not even in the top five covering a range of areas from company strength and market position to design and environmental friendliness , the latest automarxx survey is the first to feature a consumer satisfaction section .
the consumer questionnaires looked at both the products and service of 33 manufacturers , and included ratings of electronics , motor power and comfort as well as of cost and standards of garage work .
while german brands mercedes , bmw , audi , volkswagen and porsche still occupy the top five of the overall rating section , they barely figure in the consumer satisfaction top ten , beaten by toyota at number one , followed by other asian competitors such as subaru , honda and mazda .
quality over image bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auto mazda , autoshow in detroit , 2004 mazda rx-8 the competition is not surprised by the results .
speaking from the essen motor show , which opened on thursday , mazda 's peter tuhl told deutsche welle that mazda 's position in the top five reflected the japanese company 's enduringly high technical standards .
he said a mazda owner experiences " lasting satisfaction . "
a german car owner , on the other hand , is more like a " disappointed lover who realizes the first promises are n't going to come true " .
the survey results seem to back up the mark .
mercedes has no problem with its image , but rather with its follow-through , according to the results .
dr. ferdinand dudenhöffer , who led the survey , said the emphasis german companies like mercedes place on innovation comes at the expense of production quality .
" every technical innovation increases the risk of a break-down , " he says . " in this respect , toyota is more conservative , which may not be good for its image , but is very beneficial in terms of reliability . "
" made in germany " loses clout the autobild survey confirms the trend .
the first german entry on the list is bmw at number five , again trumped by asian rivals .
vw ceo dr. bernd pischetsrieder admitted to autobild that " in technical terms , toyota is better then us .
but not just us . "
the results of the automarxx survey are a blow to stuttgart-based mercedes in particular , which comes in at an astonishingly low number 32 .
other german manufacturers fared equally badly , with volkswagen at number 31 and opel only four places higher . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de motor show optimism spreads to market the guarded optimism that surrounded the frankfurt motor show last month is proving to be well founded .

crushing the hopes of an entire region for economic recovery , the operating company of a proposed chip plant in eastern germany announced on friday that it will declare bankruptcy . the investors had already backed off and the federal government was showing no signs of making a last-ditch effort to save construction of the plant .

things came to a head when the plant ’ s biggest investor , the arab emirate of dubai , failed to hand over a payment of € 89 million in early november . the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million , didn ’ t send the money as it was waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million loan . brandenburg itself had given € 40 million to build the plant , which was intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , contributed the same amount . the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . need for new eu approval final straw a smaller plant would have required operating company communicant to file a completely new application for funds with the eu commission , setting back the project an additional six months , brandenburg ’ s former premier , manfred stolpe told german public television .
this additional delay had finally caused investors to jump ship , said stolpe , now responsible for pushing east german revitalization in the schröder government . his successor , matthias platzeck , had previously criticized stolpe for presenting the project as a sure thing three years ago .
stolpe countered that the chip plant ’ s financing had seemed solid at the time . the chip plant ’ s demise shocked residents of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the town at the german-polish border where the factory building ’ s shell had slowly risen over the past years . the area struggles with some of germany ’ s highest unemployment rates and people there saw the factory as a last hope for economic recovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 28.11.2003 dutch stand firm on coffee shops großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as ministers agreed on tough new anti-drug measures , the dutch took it all in stride .
after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .
sweden had also demanded the closure of the coffee shops , where people for over 30 years have been able to buy and smoke cannabis without fearing legal repercussions . " we have a situation where in certain conditions we will not prosecute and these conditions are kept very strictly , " dutch justice minister piet hein donner told reporters .
" this decision does not cover that policy . " but he added that the netherlands had agreed to increase its penalties for the possession of small quantities of soft drugs from one month to a year in those circumstances which carried a sentence . plans to restrict shops to locals although remaining firm that the coffee shops would remain open , donner made some concessions .
among them was the annoucement that the dutch government would continue with its plans to restrict coffee shop owners from selling soft drugs to non-residents in a bid to halt drug tourism in holland . despite the dutch commitment to keeping the coffee shops open , those present were relieved to have reached agreement on the range of new laws which will cover all types of drug dealing , ranging from local networks to large-scale international operations . " europe has now equipped itself with an instrument to combat drug trafficking , " italy ’ s castelli said , beaming with weary satisfaction after having admitted earlier that it would be extremely difficult to achieve consensus . longer jail terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the agreed rules , offering , selling or producing drugs should be sanctioned with maximum jail terms of at least one to three years if individuals are caught producing or distributing drugs or cultivating opium poppies , coca bush or cannabis plants .
in cases involving large-scale international drug trafficking , jail terms should be at least five to 10 years , according to the agreement . new threat from expansion many in the eu say such an agreement is needed in view of the bloc 's eastern expansion in 2004 .
while the eu 's drug monitoring agency in lisbon reports that drug use inside the eu has been stabilizing after years of sharp increases , drug use has been rising in the 10 countries in central and eastern europe which will join the bloc next may . cnce considered simply transit areas for the movement of drugs to the eu , after accession the new member states will present traffickers with new and more lucrative markets . eu justice ministers say they hope that the severity of the new rules as well as the cross-border cooperation and harmonization will help combat the new threat and suppress the old . the agreed rules will now be passed to the european parliament for discussion .
if agreed upon there , the laws will enter into force 18 months after being formally approved by ministers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german and dutch ministers plan joint drug offensive german interior minister otto schily and dutch justice minister piet hein donner have agreed to fight the drug trade together but clashed on the subject of dutch coffee shops which sell cannabis .

this additional delay had finally caused investors to jump ship , said stolpe , now responsible for pushing east german revitalization in the schröder government . his successor , matthias platzeck , had previously criticized stolpe for presenting the project as a sure thing three years ago .
stolpe countered that the chip plant ’ s financing had seemed solid at the time . the chip plant ’ s demise shocked residents of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the town at the german-polish border where the factory building ’ s shell had slowly risen over the past years . the area struggles with some of germany ’ s highest unemployment rates and people there saw the factory as a last hope for economic recovery .
about 1,300 jobs would have been created if the plant had been finished . third on a list of bad investments the chip plant became the third massive project with public investments in brandenburg to go belly up .
in 2002 , both a motor speedway and a company called cargolifter , which planned to build zeppelins for cargo transport , filed for bankruptcy . state government officials hope to salvage the speedway by offering millions of euros in subsidies to a leaseholder .
a private consortium plans to fill cargolifter ’ s giant construction hall with the world ’ s largest indoor rain forest and open an amusement and water park there by oct .

"
germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer : der kaiser of austria .
it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .
eichel makes a stand finance minister hans eichel was among the first into the fray last month when he criticized the cream of germany ’ s sporting heroes on a television talk show .
“ i ’ m not among the fans of people like boris becker , michael schumacher and franz beckenbauer , ” eichel said in an attack on those who have moved to switzerland and austria , where taxes are lower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : show me the money !
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker has had a taxing time .
it may be too much to expect a permanent return from boris becker , who was badly burned last year when a munich court convicted him of tax evasion and ordered him to pay a € 600,000 -lrb- $ 714,000 -rrb- fine .
it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .
fellow cross-border dwellers such as former wimbledon champion michael stich and champion speed skater anni friesinger are also happy to remain in austria while former tour de france champion jan ullrich has only just finished unpacking after he moved from the black forest to switzerland last year .
as for the racing schumacher brothers , the latest outburst from the government can not come as too much of a surprise , especially to ralf .
while his more successful and tactful brother michael keeps a low profile on his swiss farm , baby schumi has faced heated criticism since moving to salzburg in austria .
taxation jungle his cause was not helped by remarks he made last year which disparaged his home country .
“ germany is simply a taxation jungle , ” the younger schumacher said .
“ i don ’ t feel like having tax collectors on my heels .
i don ’ t want to be hunted down like boris becker or steffi graf .
that ’ s why i used the chance to go abroad for tax reasons . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's sporting heroes profit from successful year thanks to the sporting heroes who have contributed to one of the country 's most successful years for sport , things are n't all doom and gloom in germany .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .
more colors for cabs while taxi drivers didn ’ t demonstrate en mass in front of the bundesrat on friday , they still had strong opinions about a plan to do away with cab color restrictions .

"
germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz beckenbauer : der kaiser of austria .
it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .
eichel makes a stand finance minister hans eichel was among the first into the fray last month when he criticized the cream of germany ’ s sporting heroes on a television talk show .
“ i ’ m not among the fans of people like boris becker , michael schumacher and franz beckenbauer , ” eichel said in an attack on those who have moved to switzerland and austria , where taxes are lower .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : show me the money !
german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : boris becker has had a taxing time .
it may be too much to expect a permanent return from boris becker , who was badly burned last year when a munich court convicted him of tax evasion and ordered him to pay a € 600,000 -lrb- $ 714,000 -rrb- fine .
it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .
fellow cross-border dwellers such as former wimbledon champion michael stich and champion speed skater anni friesinger are also happy to remain in austria while former tour de france champion jan ullrich has only just finished unpacking after he moved from the black forest to switzerland last year .
as for the racing schumacher brothers , the latest outburst from the government can not come as too much of a surprise , especially to ralf .
while his more successful and tactful brother michael keeps a low profile on his swiss farm , baby schumi has faced heated criticism since moving to salzburg in austria .
taxation jungle his cause was not helped by remarks he made last year which disparaged his home country .
“ germany is simply a taxation jungle , ” the younger schumacher said .
“ i don ’ t feel like having tax collectors on my heels .
i don ’ t want to be hunted down like boris becker or steffi graf .
that ’ s why i used the chance to go abroad for tax reasons . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's sporting heroes profit from successful year thanks to the sporting heroes who have contributed to one of the country 's most successful years for sport , things are n't all doom and gloom in germany .

cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .

for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 28.11.2003 fashion , power and women ’ s rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long hours , low or no pay : a living hell for these vietnamese seamstresses .
cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

police in hamburg have arrested an algerian suspected of being the ringleader of a network of al qaeda activitists who allegedly have been recruiting extremists in europe to carry out suicide attacks in iraq . the man , identified by as abderrazak mahdjoub , 29 , an algerian also known as “ the sheikh , ” was arrested on friday morning in this northern port city on the request of italian authorities , who are requesting he be handed over to them . “ he has been arrested on the basis of an italian investigation and been taken into custody pending extradition , ” marion zippel , a senior prosecutor in the hamburg prosecutor ’ s office , told reuters . mahdjoub is suspected of being the leader of a group of recruiters active in europe looking for people to travel to iraq to carry out suicide bombings .
one of the recruits , according to the arrest warrant , was suspected of involvement in the rocket attack in october on a baghdad hotel where u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz was staying . mahdjoub is also thought to have had contacts with the hamburg-based terror cell which carried out the sept .
11 attacks in the u.s. hamburg police had arrested mahdjoub in july on suspicion of plotting to bomb attack in spain , but he was released several months later for lack of evidence . the chief of germany 's foreign intelligence unit , august hanning , described iraq last week as a " crystallizing point " for the radical islamist cause .
he said activists were heading there from european countries to fight the u.s. occupation . in april , police said dozens of islamic extremists were being approached by recruiters in italy and germany .
they were then sent to training camps in syria before going to iraq to join a group with links to al qaeda . italian dragnet the arrest in hamburg was part of a larger italian-led anti-terror sweep carried out on thursday and friday .
prosecutors in milan had issued arrest warrants for five individuals suspected of being part of the terror cell .
all five were charged with association with the aim of international terrorism . italian police arrested two north africans in milan , also suspected of being members of the recruiting group .
they have been identified as housni jamal , 20 , of morocco and bouyahia maher ben abdelaziz , 33 , of tunisia . two others - an iraqi man and a tunisian woman - remain at large , the interior ministry in rome told the associated press .
the iraqi is suspected of having fled to syria while the woman is thought to have returned to her home country . the ministry confirmed earlier reports that a sixth man , a tunisian national , was arrested on saturday for allegedly providing assistance to the terror cell . since suicide bombers killed 19 italians in southern iraq earlier this month , italy has cracked down on people suspected of having links to terror networks .
rome recently expelled seven north africans accused of having links with militant groups and an imam from senegal who publicly expressed support for osama bin laden . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .

but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .

while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .
anti-social behavior other social democrats have also added their ire to the gathering condemnation .
“ it ’ s unpatriotic of these people taking full advantage of the possibilities of our country all their lives but then shoveling their money into switzerland or liechtenstein , ” sigmar gabriel , a former premier of the german state of lower saxony , told german broadcaster n-tv .
“ i even consider that behavior anti-social , ” he added .
caught up in the growing wave of disgust , reinhard bütikofer , co-leader of the green party which shares power with schröder ’ s spd , even went so far as to suggest stripping those who enjoy other nations ’ tax breaks of their german citizenship .
“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .

it was the second time becker had been caught after paying € 3 million -lrb- $ 3.6 million -rrb- in back taxes earlier in his career for living in munich while claiming tax-haven monaco as his residence .
“ i came back to germany voluntarily in 1994 and have paid more than € 25 million -lrb- $ 29.7 million -rrb- in taxes since then , ” becker said .
“ for that , i ’ ve got a kick in the rear end . ”
it is also unlikely that the other stars named by the politicians will be in any hurry to return home to face german tax bills .
stars established abroad world cup winning captain and coach beckenbauer will be quite content to continue living just south of the german border in austria where he has been a resident for decades .

germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .

when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .

germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros . germany ’ s standing as a sporting nation in the world has been built on the success and high profile nature of the home-grown stars that have excelled in their fields under the red , black and gold flag .
from soccer to skating , racing to running , germans are there or thereabouts when it comes to helping themselves to the silverware .
but despite the accolades and the respect that the country ’ s sports stars have brought to their nation , many now find themselves in the firing line of angry politicians who are branding them “ unpatriotic ” and “ anti-social , ” among other insults .
these enraged politicians believe that many of the most successful german sportsmen and women have taken much from the country in terms of financial investment but have personally chosen not to give anything back .
in short , it ’ s a question of tax .
success outweighed fiscal loss in recent times , those sporting idols who moved abroad to escape germany ’ s high tax rates were long immune to criticism .
their contribution to global sport far outweighed the fiscal loss , people thought .
what sports stars brought to germany in terms of prestige dwarfed the fact that their millions sat in foreign tax havens , accumulating interest .

it now seems that the days of the blind eye are over .
while dwindling german tax revenues are forcing the government into making unpopular spending and pension cuts , the lucrative exile of heroes such as soccer monarch franz beckenbauer -lrb- picture -rrb- , cycling star jan ullrich , tennis icons boris becker and michael stich and the racing schumacher brothers has come under new scrutiny .
when once it was almost taboo to bring up the subject of tax in the same breath as the name of “ der kaiser , ” “ boom boom ” or “ schumi , ” high profile political figures are now venturing into unknown territory by attacking these untouchables for abandoning their homeland and taking their much needed cash with them .

german chancellor gerhard schröder , who is proud of his country ’ s sporting history , recently criticized the same people who have often received personal congratulations from him on their successes .
during a meeting of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- in october , the reform-obsessed schröder turned on the tax exiles .
“ our problem is neither the economic reforms we ’ re making nor the tax levels we have but rather what tax is actually paid here and not carted off into switzerland or luxembourg , ” the chancellor told applauding party members .

“ those who don ’ t want to pay -lrb- german -rrb- tax can give up their german passports , ” bütikofer said .
plans to cut income tax rate however , while slapping the wrists of the wealthy sports idols with one hand , the german government seems intent on coaxing them back home with the other .
germany ’ s top income tax rate is currently 48.5 percent , down from 51 percent in 2000 .
but now schröder and his penny-pinchers are planning to cut that rate again next year to 42 percent , partly in the hope that wealthy germans will stay at home or return to more favorable financial conditions .

police in hamburg have arrested an algerian suspected of being the ringleader of a network of al qaeda activitists who allegedly have been recruiting extremists in europe to carry out suicide attacks in iraq . the man , identified by as abderrazak mahdjoub , 29 , an algerian also known as “ the sheikh , ” was arrested on friday morning in this northern port city on the request of italian authorities , who are requesting he be handed over to them . “ he has been arrested on the basis of an italian investigation and been taken into custody pending extradition , ” marion zippel , a senior prosecutor in the hamburg prosecutor ’ s office , told reuters . mahdjoub is suspected of being the leader of a group of recruiters active in europe looking for people to travel to iraq to carry out suicide bombings .
one of the recruits , according to the arrest warrant , was suspected of involvement in the rocket attack in october on a baghdad hotel where u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz was staying . mahdjoub is also thought to have had contacts with the hamburg-based terror cell which carried out the sept .
11 attacks in the u.s. hamburg police had arrested mahdjoub in july on suspicion of plotting to bomb attack in spain , but he was released several months later for lack of evidence . the chief of germany 's foreign intelligence unit , august hanning , described iraq last week as a " crystallizing point " for the radical islamist cause .
he said activists were heading there from european countries to fight the u.s. occupation . in april , police said dozens of islamic extremists were being approached by recruiters in italy and germany .
they were then sent to training camps in syria before going to iraq to join a group with links to al qaeda . italian dragnet the arrest in hamburg was part of a larger italian-led anti-terror sweep carried out on thursday and friday .
prosecutors in milan had issued arrest warrants for five individuals suspected of being part of the terror cell .
all five were charged with association with the aim of international terrorism . italian police arrested two north africans in milan , also suspected of being members of the recruiting group .
they have been identified as housni jamal , 20 , of morocco and bouyahia maher ben abdelaziz , 33 , of tunisia . two others - an iraqi man and a tunisian woman - remain at large , the interior ministry in rome told the associated press .
the iraqi is suspected of having fled to syria while the woman is thought to have returned to her home country . the ministry confirmed earlier reports that a sixth man , a tunisian national , was arrested on saturday for allegedly providing assistance to the terror cell . since suicide bombers killed 19 italians in southern iraq earlier this month , italy has cracked down on people suspected of having links to terror networks .
rome recently expelled seven north africans accused of having links with militant groups and an imam from senegal who publicly expressed support for osama bin laden . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

after european union justice ministers announced an agreement on a common cross-border drug policy , the netherlands exposed a clause in the rules by exercising its right to keep its " coffee shops " open . in a step towards harmonizing national laws within the european union and streamlining the fight against illegal drugs , eu justice ministers agreed on a new set of rules on thursday after more than two years of negotiations . however , due to a clause which allows member states to exempt individuals from criminal liability , the netherlands was able to announce that its controversial " coffee shops " would survive . " on personal consumption , each country will be free to regulate as it regards appropriate , " said italy 's justice minister , roberto castelli , whose country currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
the dutch seized on this to declare that the smokers ' sanctuaries would not be closed down . it was a slightly embarrassing turn of events after ministers heralded the agreement as a new dawn for eu drug enforcement and the end to the bickering between member states , particularly the long-running dispute between the dutch and france and sweden , which have long opposed attitudes in the netherlands toward " soft " drugs like cannabis and hash . france and sweden opposed dutch approach bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paris and stockholm had campaigned for tougher jail terms for minor offences , a move which came up against dutch opposition mainly due to the country 's policy of tolerating the use and sale of soft drugs .
sweden had also demanded the closure of the coffee shops , where people for over 30 years have been able to buy and smoke cannabis without fearing legal repercussions . " we have a situation where in certain conditions we will not prosecute and these conditions are kept very strictly , " dutch justice minister piet hein donner told reporters .

" but he added that the netherlands had agreed to increase its penalties for the possession of small quantities of soft drugs from one month to a year in those circumstances which carried a sentence . plans to restrict shops to locals although remaining firm that the coffee shops would remain open , donner made some concessions .
among them was the annoucement that the dutch government would continue with its plans to restrict coffee shop owners from selling soft drugs to non-residents in a bid to halt drug tourism in holland . despite the dutch commitment to keeping the coffee shops open , those present were relieved to have reached agreement on the range of new laws which will cover all types of drug dealing , ranging from local networks to large-scale international operations . " europe has now equipped itself with an instrument to combat drug trafficking , " italy ’ s castelli said , beaming with weary satisfaction after having admitted earlier that it would be extremely difficult to achieve consensus . longer jail terms bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : under the agreed rules , offering , selling or producing drugs should be sanctioned with maximum jail terms of at least one to three years if individuals are caught producing or distributing drugs or cultivating opium poppies , coca bush or cannabis plants .
in cases involving large-scale international drug trafficking , jail terms should be at least five to 10 years , according to the agreement . new threat from expansion many in the eu say such an agreement is needed in view of the bloc 's eastern expansion in 2004 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 28.11.2003 death blow for chip factory project großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the chip factory 's half-finished building ever be completed ?
crushing the hopes of an entire region for economic recovery , the operating company of a proposed chip plant in eastern germany announced on friday that it will declare bankruptcy . the investors had already backed off and the federal government was showing no signs of making a last-ditch effort to save construction of the plant .
but a spokesman for the factor 's operating company on friday said there was still a slim chance that the project 's demise could be avoided : “ the board of directors still hasn ’ t signed the papers -lrb- to file for insolvency . -rrb- " the chip factory ’ s fate had already seemed sealed on thursday after government officials from the german state of brandenburg , who had supported the project with public funds , said that only the federal government could still salvage the plant . investors fail to give more money ever since its announcement three years ago , financing for the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project has been uncertain .
things came to a head when the plant ’ s biggest investor , the arab emirate of dubai , failed to hand over a payment of € 89 million in early november . the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million , didn ’ t send the money as it was waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million loan . brandenburg itself had given € 40 million to build the plant , which was intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , contributed the same amount . the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . need for new eu approval final straw a smaller plant would have required operating company communicant to file a completely new application for funds with the eu commission , setting back the project an additional six months , brandenburg ’ s former premier , manfred stolpe told german public television .
this additional delay had finally caused investors to jump ship , said stolpe , now responsible for pushing east german revitalization in the schröder government . his successor , matthias platzeck , had previously criticized stolpe for presenting the project as a sure thing three years ago .
stolpe countered that the chip plant ’ s financing had seemed solid at the time . the chip plant ’ s demise shocked residents of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the town at the german-polish border where the factory building ’ s shell had slowly risen over the past years . the area struggles with some of germany ’ s highest unemployment rates and people there saw the factory as a last hope for economic recovery .
about 1,300 jobs would have been created if the plant had been finished . third on a list of bad investments the chip plant became the third massive project with public investments in brandenburg to go belly up .

crushing the hopes of an entire region for economic recovery , the operating company of a proposed chip plant in eastern germany announced on friday that it will declare bankruptcy . the investors had already backed off and the federal government was showing no signs of making a last-ditch effort to save construction of the plant .
but a spokesman for the factor 's operating company on friday said there was still a slim chance that the project 's demise could be avoided : “ the board of directors still hasn ’ t signed the papers -lrb- to file for insolvency . -rrb- " the chip factory ’ s fate had already seemed sealed on thursday after government officials from the german state of brandenburg , who had supported the project with public funds , said that only the federal government could still salvage the plant . investors fail to give more money ever since its announcement three years ago , financing for the € 1.3 billion -lrb- $ 1.5 billion -rrb- project has been uncertain .
things came to a head when the plant ’ s biggest investor , the arab emirate of dubai , failed to hand over a payment of € 89 million in early november . the gulf state , set to invest a total of € 212 million , didn ’ t send the money as it was waiting for assurances from the german government as well as from the state government of brandenburg to act as guarantors for a € 650 million loan . brandenburg itself had given € 40 million to build the plant , which was intended mainly as a custom chip production foundry for the communications industry .
intel , the u.s.-based chip maker , contributed the same amount . the rest of the money was supposed to come from european union funds , but eu officials plan to give significantly less if the plant gets reduced in size , as is likely to happen . need for new eu approval final straw a smaller plant would have required operating company communicant to file a completely new application for funds with the eu commission , setting back the project an additional six months , brandenburg ’ s former premier , manfred stolpe told german public television .
this additional delay had finally caused investors to jump ship , said stolpe , now responsible for pushing east german revitalization in the schröder government . his successor , matthias platzeck , had previously criticized stolpe for presenting the project as a sure thing three years ago .
stolpe countered that the chip plant ’ s financing had seemed solid at the time . the chip plant ’ s demise shocked residents of frankfurt -lrb- oder -rrb- , the town at the german-polish border where the factory building ’ s shell had slowly risen over the past years . the area struggles with some of germany ’ s highest unemployment rates and people there saw the factory as a last hope for economic recovery .
about 1,300 jobs would have been created if the plant had been finished . third on a list of bad investments the chip plant became the third massive project with public investments in brandenburg to go belly up .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .
more colors for cabs while taxi drivers didn ’ t demonstrate en mass in front of the bundesrat on friday , they still had strong opinions about a plan to do away with cab color restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light ivory 's no longer the only choice of color for german taxis .
for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .
government officials from the southwestern state of saarland , who pushed for the liberalization , said they will act swiftly to allow for more cab color variety . no more loopholes for clever sports managers germans of all hues were rubbed the wrong way recently when they discovered that soccer clubs such as borussia dortmund had managed to save a thousands of euros by making use of a loophole in germany ’ s tax system : by paying players tax-exempt overtime premiums for nighttime or weekend games , clubs could lower the base salaries they pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund players will no longer get tax-exempt overtime pay .
the tax exemption had been originally intended for low-paid workers such as nurses and policemen .
bundesrat members have now closed the loophole by limiting the tax exemption to people with monthly salaries of less than € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,600 -rrb- . free public parking as german municipalities struggle to fill budget holes caused by the weak economy , they ’ re bound to appreciate every euro that comes their way .
but as cities compete for customers in their downtown areas , some have started to question a federal law banning free short-term parking in spaces with parking meters . the bundesrat heard the complaints and decided to let municipalities decide for themselves whether they want to entice people to come to their urban shopping areas by offering free 30-minute parking or not . driving cars at 17 young germans have long eyed their peers in other countries with envy since german law says they can ’ t drive a car before the age of 18 .
that could soon change if the federal government agrees with a bundesrat decision to allow teenagers to get behind the wheel a year earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the bundesrat 's decision to lower the driving age , they 'll still be a little to young to drive a real beetle . the change in the law would require , however , that drivers under 18 be accompanied by an adult over the age of 30 .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .
more colors for cabs while taxi drivers didn ’ t demonstrate en mass in front of the bundesrat on friday , they still had strong opinions about a plan to do away with cab color restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light ivory 's no longer the only choice of color for german taxis .
for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .
government officials from the southwestern state of saarland , who pushed for the liberalization , said they will act swiftly to allow for more cab color variety . no more loopholes for clever sports managers germans of all hues were rubbed the wrong way recently when they discovered that soccer clubs such as borussia dortmund had managed to save a thousands of euros by making use of a loophole in germany ’ s tax system : by paying players tax-exempt overtime premiums for nighttime or weekend games , clubs could lower the base salaries they pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund players will no longer get tax-exempt overtime pay .
the tax exemption had been originally intended for low-paid workers such as nurses and policemen .
bundesrat members have now closed the loophole by limiting the tax exemption to people with monthly salaries of less than € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,600 -rrb- . free public parking as german municipalities struggle to fill budget holes caused by the weak economy , they ’ re bound to appreciate every euro that comes their way .
but as cities compete for customers in their downtown areas , some have started to question a federal law banning free short-term parking in spaces with parking meters . the bundesrat heard the complaints and decided to let municipalities decide for themselves whether they want to entice people to come to their urban shopping areas by offering free 30-minute parking or not . driving cars at 17 young germans have long eyed their peers in other countries with envy since german law says they can ’ t drive a car before the age of 18 .
that could soon change if the federal government agrees with a bundesrat decision to allow teenagers to get behind the wheel a year earlier .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the bundesrat 's decision to lower the driving age , they 'll still be a little to young to drive a real beetle . the change in the law would require , however , that drivers under 18 be accompanied by an adult over the age of 30 .

cab colors , chicken and cheeky sports stars : germany ’ s upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , took a breather from tackling large reform plans friday and dealt with a range of rather obscure issues instead . while friday ’ s decisions by the bundesrat may not have a profound effect on life in germany , some of them were cause for controversy : hundreds of animal rights activists gathered outside the german parliament to protest a proposal reversing a ban on keeping egg-producing chicken in tiny cages .
the demonstration turned out to be unsuccessful in swaying bundesrat members .
they voted for an indefinite delay of the ban , which was originally set to take effect in 2007 .
supporters of the delay argued that alternative ways of keeping chicken , mainly larger cages , should be studied before switching completely to free-range methods .
the ban ’ s initiator , german agriculture minister renate künast , accused her opponents of trying to delay putting an end to crammed conditions for chicken “ till kingdom come . ”
immediately after the vote , künast announced that she will refuse to sign the new ordinance to delay the ban .
still , a ban will come eventually since european union rules say industrial-style egg production must come to an end by 2012 .
up to now , german consumers have displayed a schizophrenic attitude toward the issue .
while an overwhelming majority supports the ban in theory , more people still buy eggs laid by caged chicken , according to german public television .
more colors for cabs while taxi drivers didn ’ t demonstrate en mass in front of the bundesrat on friday , they still had strong opinions about a plan to do away with cab color restrictions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : light ivory 's no longer the only choice of color for german taxis .
for decades , all german taxis have been required to wear a coat of “ light ivory ” paint . some of the country ’ s 25,000 cab companies support the uniformity as a valuable trademark , but many say it ’ s unnecessary and another piece of costly red tape that needs to disappear . the latter group won friday ’ s argument in the upper chamber , opening the way for a multitude of colors under the taxi sign .
government officials from the southwestern state of saarland , who pushed for the liberalization , said they will act swiftly to allow for more cab color variety . no more loopholes for clever sports managers germans of all hues were rubbed the wrong way recently when they discovered that soccer clubs such as borussia dortmund had managed to save a thousands of euros by making use of a loophole in germany ’ s tax system : by paying players tax-exempt overtime premiums for nighttime or weekend games , clubs could lower the base salaries they pay . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund players will no longer get tax-exempt overtime pay .
the tax exemption had been originally intended for low-paid workers such as nurses and policemen .
bundesrat members have now closed the loophole by limiting the tax exemption to people with monthly salaries of less than € 8,000 -lrb- $ 9,600 -rrb- . free public parking as german municipalities struggle to fill budget holes caused by the weak economy , they ’ re bound to appreciate every euro that comes their way .
but as cities compete for customers in their downtown areas , some have started to question a federal law banning free short-term parking in spaces with parking meters . the bundesrat heard the complaints and decided to let municipalities decide for themselves whether they want to entice people to come to their urban shopping areas by offering free 30-minute parking or not . driving cars at 17 young germans have long eyed their peers in other countries with envy since german law says they can ’ t drive a car before the age of 18 .
that could soon change if the federal government agrees with a bundesrat decision to allow teenagers to get behind the wheel a year earlier .

the single european currency rose to $ 1.2017 midway through the european session of trading .
it later retreated to $ 1.2007 .
the move came hot on the heels of its previous all-time peak of $ 1.1979 set on november 19 .
dealers said there had been no particular trigger for the upswing , which came amid thin trading volumes after thursday 's thanksgiving day holiday in the united states .
the dollar is currently suffering from concerns about the large current account and budget deficits in the u.s. , as well as global trade tensions and the almost insatiable appetite of american consumers for foreign goods . more briefs 28.11.2003 -pipe- euro zone business confidence hits two year high 28.11.2003 -pipe- condomi confidence slips as growth stutters 28.11.2003 -pipe- printing giant slashes jobs as ad slump continues 27.11.2003 -pipe- westlb investigation to engulf more execs 27.11.2003 -pipe- public funding last hope for chip plant 27.11.2003 -pipe- ig metall fixes pay strategy for 2004 27.11.2003 -pipe- tui predicts continued tourism recovery 26.11.2003 -pipe- volkswagen sees u.s. sales falling in 2004 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

cheap clothing has its price .
it may be great for consumers , but seamstresses in developing countries face a difficult workday .
a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .
and women then strut to the nearest stores to buy these fashions , or at least cheap knock-offs of the haute couture .
but few consumers know that their bargain purchases are mainly manufactured in eastern europe , asia and latin america .
according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .

cheap clothing has its price .

a campaign by a german women ’ s rights organization now wants to change this . every season , models strut down the catwalks of paris , london and rome wearing the newest fashions .

according to the german women ’ s rights organization terre des femmes -lrb- tdf -rrb- , up to 95 percent of the clothing sold on the german market is sewn by mostly women in these countries .
even fewer are aware of the working conditions facing these women .
tdf says human rights are violated on a daily basis in the supplier firms of big fashion companies .
a minimum wage that does not suffice to survive , as well as firing if union activities are attempted are the rule , the organization says .
" over and over companies tried to prevent workers from unionizing , " says junya lek yimprasert , herself a garment worker for bed & bath and the coordinator of the thai labor campaign .
she experienced this when she tried to get female staff paid for their overtime .
tdf wants to change this .
they have started a new campaign called " fashion , power and women ’ s rights " in germany .
it wants to make consumers , but also companies from the garment sector , aware of the textile workers ’ situation and sensitize them to these conditions when they buy their clothes .
health problems when seamstresses in thailand , bangladesh or macedonia go to work in the morning , they don ’ t know when they ’ ll return home in the evenings .
if their factory has just gotten a new order , then they might have to sit at their sewing machines until late in the night .
breaks are short , conversations during work forbidden – the main thing is that the order gets finished .
tdf says the female workers are also exposed to disrespectful treatment , sexual abuse and permanent health risks due to a lack of health and safety regulations .
" the nature of production now is changing , so women work harder and faster and they take less time to rest , " said yimprasert . " so the women get lots of health-related problems , like urinary tract infections , because they do n't go to the toilet when they have to . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a seamstress in egypt .
in addition , these women have very little time for their families .
" after the crisis in thailand , we are seeing a lot more single mothers in the garments industry because their husbands just left when they faced the economic crisis and left them with the burden of the children , " she says .
women in macedonia ’ s garment industry experience similar problems , says activist anifa demirovska from the humanitarian and charitable roma society .
" although the wages are anyway already very low , salaries and social security are sometimes not even paid .
that means that older women can not retire because these payments into the pension system are missing , " demirovska says .
" your voice is a much louder voice than ours . "
tdf ’ s gisela burckhardt points out that low wages are the leading argument for building factories overseas .
yet the wages of the seamstresses only account for one percent of the sale price of the finished blouse , pants or jacket .
the organization is now calling on german consumers to pay closer attention to the origin of the clothing they buy and the conditions under which it ’ s produced .
" if a lot of women do this , it shows a company the significance , or the sensibility of their customers for this issue , " says burckhardt .
" and this has the effect that company policy will look more closely at controlling minimum social standards . "
the women ’ s rights advocates want german consumers to show their solidarity with the textile workers .
this could have a greater impact on the situation than protests by the workers themselves .

but for everyday use , german car-owners prefer japanese cars to the legendary names of their native country .
the stunning news is the result of two surveys conducted separately by car magazine autobild and german car-insurer adac .
the so-called automarxx survey , conducted by adac with the center for automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , asked more than 38,000 car owners to rank international car companies in terms of consumer satisfaction .
the german automobile industry 's first entry on the list is porsche at number eight .

not even in the top five covering a range of areas from company strength and market position to design and environmental friendliness , the latest automarxx survey is the first to feature a consumer satisfaction section .
the consumer questionnaires looked at both the products and service of 33 manufacturers , and included ratings of electronics , motor power and comfort as well as of cost and standards of garage work .

but for everyday use , german car-owners prefer japanese cars to the legendary names of their native country .
the stunning news is the result of two surveys conducted separately by car magazine autobild and german car-insurer adac .
the so-called automarxx survey , conducted by adac with the center for automotive research at gelsenkirchen technical college , asked more than 38,000 car owners to rank international car companies in terms of consumer satisfaction .
the german automobile industry 's first entry on the list is porsche at number eight .

the study , which will first be released to the public next week , is sure to disappoint the likes of mercedes and audi , who apparently enjoy a better reputation abroad than at home .
not even in the top five covering a range of areas from company strength and market position to design and environmental friendliness , the latest automarxx survey is the first to feature a consumer satisfaction section .
the consumer questionnaires looked at both the products and service of 33 manufacturers , and included ratings of electronics , motor power and comfort as well as of cost and standards of garage work .
while german brands mercedes , bmw , audi , volkswagen and porsche still occupy the top five of the overall rating section , they barely figure in the consumer satisfaction top ten , beaten by toyota at number one , followed by other asian competitors such as subaru , honda and mazda .

he said a mazda owner experiences " lasting satisfaction . "
a german car owner , on the other hand , is more like a " disappointed lover who realizes the first promises are n't going to come true " .

mercedes has no problem with its image , but rather with its follow-through , according to the results .
dr. ferdinand dudenhöffer , who led the survey , said the emphasis german companies like mercedes place on innovation comes at the expense of production quality .

the survey results seem to back up the mark .
mercedes has no problem with its image , but rather with its follow-through , according to the results .
dr. ferdinand dudenhöffer , who led the survey , said the emphasis german companies like mercedes place on innovation comes at the expense of production quality .
" every technical innovation increases the risk of a break-down , " he says . " in this respect , toyota is more conservative , which may not be good for its image , but is very beneficial in terms of reliability . "
" made in germany " loses clout the autobild survey confirms the trend .
the first german entry on the list is bmw at number five , again trumped by asian rivals .
vw ceo dr. bernd pischetsrieder admitted to autobild that " in technical terms , toyota is better then us .
but not just us . "
the results of the automarxx survey are a blow to stuttgart-based mercedes in particular , which comes in at an astonishingly low number 32 .
other german manufacturers fared equally badly , with volkswagen at number 31 and opel only four places higher . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de motor show optimism spreads to market the guarded optimism that surrounded the frankfurt motor show last month is proving to be well founded .

the leander-class frigate hms scylla will be open for viewing at plymouth 's devonport dockyard this weekend before wreckers get on board and start boring holes prior to scuttling her off whitsand bay in cornwall .
she was bought by plymouth 's national marine aquarium -lrb- nma -rrb- last month for about £ 200,000 with funding from the south west regional development agency -lrb- rda -rrb- .
the plan is to sink the 2,500-tonne vessel for divers to explore , in addition to it being colonised by sea life .
the ship , the last of her kind to be built at devonport dockyard in plymouth in the late 1960s , arrived back in the city earlier this month from portsmouth after months of negotiations .

when the scylla is placed on the seabed , she will become europe 's first artificial reef for divers .
she is due to be sunk in april 2004 , after which it is expected she will help generate £ 1m a year for the local economy .
melanie cowie , of the nma , said : " when scylla is finally placed on the seabed , the story of her new life just begins .
" using divers and strategically-placed webcams , we will be able to research and monitor the incredible marine life that will inhabit scylla .
we anticipate colonisation will begin very quickly . "
the aquarium has been contacted by several former crew members of the vessel , including her last commanding officer , captain mike booth .
he said : " i am delighted she will be put to such good use .
" i 've just returned from a three-year diplomatic posting to canada and was well aware of the similar use some ex-canadian navy frigates were put to . "

the leander-class frigate hms scylla will be open for viewing at plymouth 's devonport dockyard this weekend before wreckers get on board and start boring holes prior to scuttling her off whitsand bay in cornwall .
she was bought by plymouth 's national marine aquarium -lrb- nma -rrb- last month for about £ 200,000 with funding from the south west regional development agency -lrb- rda -rrb- .
the plan is to sink the 2,500-tonne vessel for divers to explore , in addition to it being colonised by sea life .
the ship , the last of her kind to be built at devonport dockyard in plymouth in the late 1960s , arrived back in the city earlier this month from portsmouth after months of negotiations .
hms scylla a leander class frigate with a general and anti-submarine role built in the late 1960s weighs 2,500-tonnes 113 metres in length the ship was recommended for disposal in 1991 she was decommissioned in december 1993 similar vessels have been placed on the seabed in canada , australia and new zealand the vessel was taken out of active service in 1993 and has been used as a training facility in portsmouth since then .
when the scylla is placed on the seabed , she will become europe 's first artificial reef for divers .
she is due to be sunk in april 2004 , after which it is expected she will help generate £ 1m a year for the local economy .
melanie cowie , of the nma , said : " when scylla is finally placed on the seabed , the story of her new life just begins .
" using divers and strategically-placed webcams , we will be able to research and monitor the incredible marine life that will inhabit scylla .
we anticipate colonisation will begin very quickly . "
the aquarium has been contacted by several former crew members of the vessel , including her last commanding officer , captain mike booth .
he said : " i am delighted she will be put to such good use .
" i 've just returned from a three-year diplomatic posting to canada and was well aware of the similar use some ex-canadian navy frigates were put to . "

prime minister mr blair arrived slightly late for the talks at the museum of welsh life in st fagans , four miles from cardiff , after being held up because of traffic congestion caused by security checks .
during the british-irish council meeting , mr blair and mr ahern will discuss reaction to the northern ireland assembly results .
wales ' first minister rhodri morgan hosted the summit , which is also expected to be attended by senior members of other uk administrations , including scotland , jersey , guernsey and the isle of man .

this will be the fifth meeting of the british-irish council , which was set up as part of northern ireland 's good friday agreement .
it is also cardiff 's first meeting of national leaders of this kind since hosting the european summit five years ago .
it is intended to promote co-operation between the constituent parts of the uk and ireland .
as well as discussing the irish election , the future of indigenous and lesser-used languages , like welsh , is also on the agenda .
mr morgan described the council as " a unique and valuable forum for collaboration between its members " .
he said wales would share its expertise on promoting minority languages , but also hoped to learn from other areas .
" we all recognise the importance of these issues - not only for sustaining culture , language , and diversity , but also as a means of promoting social inclusion , providing better quality public services and boosting the tourist industry , amongst other things .
" we will also be considering measures to develop the british-irish council further , enhancing its status as a thriving inter-governmental forum .

it said the staff walkouts had put at risk next march 's annual delivery targets .
before the wildcat action , first-class letter reliability had reached 92.7 % , the best performance for 15 years .
adam crozier , the royal mail 's chief executive said it was a " frustrating setback " after such strong figures .
" the vast majority of our people , around 80 % , worked normally during the unofficial action , " mr crozier added .
" but the disruption in the south east and some other parts of the country had an impact on our whole network . "
reform mr crozier also warned that the full impact of the strikes on the royal mail 's quality of service performance figures were not yet known , but would be " significant " .
for the three months to september , around 98.7 % of second-class mail was delivered on time , against a target of 98.5 % , the royal mail said .
earlier this month , the royal mail unveiled its first profit for five years , posting a pre-tax profit of £ 3m for the six months to september .
but the period did not include the period affected by the unofficial walkouts , the cost of which has been estimated at about £ 40m .
the royal mail is shedding thousands of jobs and wants to change working practices as it seeks to increase its profitability .
but anger at the way these changes were being enforced was one of the reasons behind the unofficial strikes .

dave groves has been a bluebirds fan for 30 years and , after winning promotion to division one last season , cardiff city regularly welcomes more than 15,000 people through the turnstiles at ninian park .
but would they still go if they could not actually see their heroes ?
dave groves , who is registered blind , is a huge cardiff city fan , and regularly takes a radio along to matches to follow the action with the crowd .
bbc wales news online 's tom bourton went with mr groves on one of his many pilgrimages to ninian park .
during the 20-minute walk to the ground from cardiff central train station , mr groves , 41 , from llanrumney , said he enjoyed being a part of the unique atmosphere of the terraces .
" there is something very special about walking out of the ground when you have won because all the home fans are up and on a high , " he said .
" it is a very special moment . "
i have had four dogs and i have brought them all a little bit but i do n't think any of them enjoyed it that much dave groves he explained that , during the match , he follows the game on his portable radio , because the crowd can confuse him .
" the crowd gives you mood and general direction - but it is imprecise and it is much more helpful when there is full commentary on the radio , " he said .
" but there is no guarantee it will be full commentary , in which case you turn up at the ground and judge on crowd reaction .
" occasionally i get caught out - partly because crowds cheer ironically as well as enthusiastically . "
some grounds in the uk , including reading 's madejski stadium , offer commentary through headsets for blind and partially-sighted fans .
mr groves hopes that , in the future , all stadiums will offer this facility , making it easier for him to follow his beloved team in the flesh .
mr groves said it was a good time to be a cardiff fan " you do n't want segregation of disabled fans into the disabled fans area because that is n't social inclusion - that is a designation of special needs , " he said .
" what you want is commentary to be delivered in a situation where fans can sit anywhere , and get commentary through the headset . "
mr groves , who said he feels perfectly safe when he comes to games , explained he usually comes down to games three or four games a year .
" i am a very avid fan , but i am not a very avid attendee at the ground , " he said .
" in part this is because there are some practical issues , unless i can cajole someone to go with me .
" occasionally i come down on my own , but when i do i have to arrange a taxi back from the ground .
" i can get to the ground independently , and my previous guide dogs actually knew the route from the bus station .
we won the first seven games i came to see - i thought i was a lucky omen dave groves " but getting out is always much more difficult because there are thousands of people squeezing up against narrow exits . "
mr groves , who also goes to some away matches , admits his guide dog - a black labrador called kate - does not share his passion for the bluebirds .
" it is usually quite loud , and she does n't understand what the noise is about , " he said .
" i have had four dogs and i have brought them all a little bit , but i do n't think any of them enjoyed it that much . "
mr groves explained that he was born prematurely and lost most of his sight at birth .
" i had a little bit of vision until i was 11 which then disappeared - the first time i came to the ground was after that , " he said .
" the first season i became interested was 1971-72 - it was the first year i had access in braille to the league tables , which gave the performances of the teams scope and reference .
" we won the first seven games i came to see .
" i thought i was a lucky omen - but the subsequent years gave doubt to that interpretation ! "

dave groves , who is registered blind , is a huge cardiff city fan , and regularly takes a radio along to matches to follow the action with the crowd .
bbc wales news online 's tom bourton went with mr groves on one of his many pilgrimages to ninian park .
during the 20-minute walk to the ground from cardiff central train station , mr groves , 41 , from llanrumney , said he enjoyed being a part of the unique atmosphere of the terraces .
" there is something very special about walking out of the ground when you have won because all the home fans are up and on a high , " he said .
" it is a very special moment . "
i have had four dogs and i have brought them all a little bit but i do n't think any of them enjoyed it that much dave groves he explained that , during the match , he follows the game on his portable radio , because the crowd can confuse him .
" the crowd gives you mood and general direction - but it is imprecise and it is much more helpful when there is full commentary on the radio , " he said .
" but there is no guarantee it will be full commentary , in which case you turn up at the ground and judge on crowd reaction .
" occasionally i get caught out - partly because crowds cheer ironically as well as enthusiastically . "
some grounds in the uk , including reading 's madejski stadium , offer commentary through headsets for blind and partially-sighted fans .
mr groves hopes that , in the future , all stadiums will offer this facility , making it easier for him to follow his beloved team in the flesh .
mr groves said it was a good time to be a cardiff fan " you do n't want segregation of disabled fans into the disabled fans area because that is n't social inclusion - that is a designation of special needs , " he said .
" what you want is commentary to be delivered in a situation where fans can sit anywhere , and get commentary through the headset . "
mr groves , who said he feels perfectly safe when he comes to games , explained he usually comes down to games three or four games a year .
" i am a very avid fan , but i am not a very avid attendee at the ground , " he said .
" in part this is because there are some practical issues , unless i can cajole someone to go with me .
" occasionally i come down on my own , but when i do i have to arrange a taxi back from the ground .
" i can get to the ground independently , and my previous guide dogs actually knew the route from the bus station .
we won the first seven games i came to see - i thought i was a lucky omen dave groves " but getting out is always much more difficult because there are thousands of people squeezing up against narrow exits . "
mr groves , who also goes to some away matches , admits his guide dog - a black labrador called kate - does not share his passion for the bluebirds .
" it is usually quite loud , and she does n't understand what the noise is about , " he said .
" i have had four dogs and i have brought them all a little bit , but i do n't think any of them enjoyed it that much . "
mr groves explained that he was born prematurely and lost most of his sight at birth .
" i had a little bit of vision until i was 11 which then disappeared - the first time i came to the ground was after that , " he said .
" the first season i became interested was 1971-72 - it was the first year i had access in braille to the league tables , which gave the performances of the teams scope and reference .
" we won the first seven games i came to see .

the taiwan legislature passed a watered-down version of a proposed referendum law that allows a vote on key constitutional and policy issues .
the kmt still wants reunification with china however , the bill also specifically prohibits referenda being held on the most controversial sovereignty issues in taiwan , namely to change the island 's name , flag or territorial status .
the ruling democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- had sought to have referenda on name , flag and status either specifically allowed , or not specifically prohibited .
that move prompted harsh words from beijing , which promised a strong reaction should taiwan pass a bill to allow unrestricted referendums .
in the legislature on thursday , the opposition kuomingtang -lrb- kmt -rrb- and people 's first party alliance used its majority to push through a version of article 2 of the bill that specifically lists those three issues as not up for referenda .
included in the bill however is a " defensive referendum " mechanism that allows the cabinet to call a referendum on the island 's sovereign status if it comes under attack from a foreign power .
in the past referendum was a taboo , now it 's a bill lo chih-cheng on paper , the results of the vote appear to be a defeat to president chen shui-bian 's government , with most of the articles adopted being those drafted by the opposition .
that result has already eased tension with china , which within hours of the vote in taiwan appeared to have cooled its threats toward the island .
however , the very fact that a referendum bill has been tabled and passed is a victory to mr chen 's pro-reform agenda , if not his perceived pro-independence agenda .
" in the past , referendum was a taboo , now it 's a bill , " said lo chih-cheng , executive director of taiwan 's institute for national policy research .
the nationalist kmt had long been opposed to a referendum law , which would allow president chen to go ahead with his pledge to hold a referendum on public policy issues at the same time as the presidential election next march .
this is n't because of china , this is because we think taiwan needs to maintain stability kmt spokesman justin chou but in the past month , kmt chairman lien chan has bowed to public opinion and thrown his party 's weight behind the law , and in the process watered it down .
" at the very beginning , the opposition party was against the referendum bill and then they gave in and agreed that there should be a referendum bill , " mr lo said election debate one day after the bill went through , attention in taiwan focused on the fact the bill had been watered down - which appears to have eased tensions with beijing - and on how it will affect the race for president .
" we believe a referendum is a right of the people , and we do n't want any referendum -lrb- to -rrb- endanger cross-strait relations .
so our bill can solve all the problems , people can defend their rights and at the same time the cross-strait relationship can stay the same , " said kmt spokesman justin chou .
he rejected criticism that the kmt had bowed to beijing .
" this is n't because of china , this is because we think taiwan needs to maintain stability , " he said .
the kmt delivered a key defeat for the ruling dpp by approving one article which prohibits the president or cabinet from initiating a referendum .
instead , only the legislature or a public petition signed by 5 % of voters can do so .
any such proposal must first be reviewed by a supervisory committee whose membership would reflect the membership of the legislature .
with the opposition dominating the legislature , the ruling party has conceded that any referendum to coincide with next year 's election is almost impossible .
the dpp has responded to the vote by labelling the kmt opposition as anti-reform , a tactic it hopes will woo moderate voters .
president chen is probably slightly ahead in the presidential race , having been helped by his pressing for the referendum bill and his proposal for political reform , such as cutting the number of legislators .
but mr lo said the election campaign still had a long way to run .
" this is the beginning of the game .
the issue will now shift to who is pro-reform and who is not .
many see referendum as a reform issue as well as an independence issue , " he said .

the mp for west derbyshire , patrick mcloughlin , says the decision to close the post offices in belper would be a real blow to pensioners .
" how on earth can the government give its commitment that pensioners will still be able to collect their pensions from the post office ? "
