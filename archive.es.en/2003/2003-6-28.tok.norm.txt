the strikes that had stopped production on german assembly lines will be called off . germany 's engineering and metalworker union , ig metall , plans to put an end to strikes four weeks after eastern german auto industry workers first laid down their tools .
following 16 hours of negotiations , the trade union and employers announced on saturday morning they had failed to reach agreement in the dispute over reducing the work week from 38 to 35 hours in eastern germany .
the move would have brought practices in line with those of western germany . " the bitter truth is the strike failed , " ig metall head klaus zwickel said on saturday . he said strikes should be called off on monday .
zwickel and the union 's chief negotiator , hasso düvel , called the failure a defeat and said there was no point in continuing the strikes anymore . both union leaders and employers blamed each other for the failure to reach agreement .
" we think the employers have missed a big chance , " düvel said early saturday .
martin kannegiesser , head of the metals and engineering employers federation gesamtmetall , said the union 's proposal was unreasonable . ig metall had called for a range of working hours from 35 to 40 hours a week that would reflect the individual economic needs of the different companies .
union negotiators said the 35-hour work week could be introduced over differing timeframes , with full implementation by 2009 . but employers were reticent .
they too suggested parameters from 35 to 40 hours as well as an across-the-board reduction of working times to 37 hours in april 2005 .
but they rejected the gradual introduction of the 35-hour week and said any further harmonization with western working hours should depend on the productivity of the eastern german plants . the strikes , which involved 8,000 union members , had led to work stoppages on bmw and volkswagen assembly lines in western germany as well because necessary components from the eastern states could not be delivered . union defeat for the first time since 1954 , ig metall failed to meet its strike aims . the union will now pursue agreements with individual companies in the metal and electronics industry .
it has already completed deals with nine firms in saxony , none of which belong to employers associations .
most of the agreements foresee a full implementation of the 35-hour work week by 2009 . ig metall 's insistence on cutting working hours in the eastern german states - where nearly 18 percent of the workforce is unemployed - has been criticized by business leaders in past weeks , some of whom feared the actions could badly damage the fragile economy in the formerly communist part of germany .
some 310,000 people work are employed in the eastern german engineering and metal industry . " what ig-metall is doing in the -lsb- eastern -rsb- states is destroying jobs , " opposition christian democrat leader angela merkel told the german public television broadcaster ard last month . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ig metall strikes cripple german car production large chunks of germany ’ s proud auto industry were paralyzed monday , as strikes in the eastern part of the country meant plants in the west could not continue production .

11 , 2001 german director max färberböck ’ s feature film " september " was released this week .
the film is a daring collage of the effects of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on ordinary germans . as the first director to tackle september 11 in a feature-length drama , max färberböck ’ s second film after “ aimée & jaguar ” is a bold , some say brave , next step .
set in germany on sept .
11 , 2001 , “ september ” tells how the attacks in new york and washington didn ’ t only affect world events , but also changed life in germany . the film 's protagonists , played by some of germany 's finest actors , including jörg shüttauf , nina proll and justus von dohnányi , watch the events of the world trade center catastrophe unfold in front of their eyes . their reactions span a range of emotions and actions , from a young mother who tries desperately to continue running a child ’ s birthday party as if nothing has happened , to a pakistani man who invites his friends to celebrate with him at a restaurant , triggering a suspicious response in his pregnant girlfriend . an author suffers an initial bout of writer ’ s block , which then transforms itself into a surge of creative inspiration , and a police officer , who believes his life isn ’ t worth living because his excessive patriotism seriously irritates his u.s. colleagues in the fbi .
then there ’ s sandra , the television presenter , who reads the devastating news to a horrified germany against a backdrop of her own private worries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max färberböck director färberböck developed the idea for the film project just days after the terrorist attacks , setting himself the challenging task of completing the script within just four weeks .
he aimed to capture the feeling of sept .
11 while it still raged , and in order to help him stick to his self-imposed deadlines , he engaged co-authors john von düffel , sarah khan , matthias pacht and moritz rinke .
each writer took on one of the four stories which make up the film . “ all the stories in the film are within the bounds of reality .
it was a time of multiple nervous breakdowns and latent psychosis , and i have threaded this into the film , ” färberböck has said . the result is an emotionally loaded depiction of how people everywhere were ripped from the routine of their daily lives by acts of mass terror on the other side of the atlantic . unconventional approach “ september ” - which färberböck says was always going to be experimental - is a far cry from the classic three-act form of story telling .
instead , the director takes a fragmented approach , interweaving the contrasting plots and punctuating them with documentary footage to create a structure that reflects the disruption the attacks left in their wake .
opting too for a jagged visual concept , färberböck fills the screen with harsh , abrupt cuts that he uses to stress the emotional confusion of the various characters .
it is this conscious desertion from any traditional plot which lends the film the feel of a puzzle comprised of ill-fitting pieces . but for all its intent , the film is flawed .
none of the stories are strong enough to carry their weight alone , and even their sum total is too small when held against a backdrop so dramatic as that of new york and washington on sept .
11 , 2001 .
the authors , it seems , focused on the detail of their individual scripts , rather than looking at the film as a whole . perhaps the biggest weakness is that none of the stories would be very different if told outside the context of the twin towers , and as none of the events in the individual stories are actually the results of the attacks , the connections seem arbitrary and hard to believe . nonetheless , the film made its debut at the cannes film festival in the category “ un certain regard , ” which in itself is an achievement , given that the number of german films that make it to the prestigious competition are few and far between . leona frommelt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing 9/11 horror to berlin the visitor count at a berlin photo exhibit featuring amateur and professional photos of new york on sept .

the strikes that had stopped production on german assembly lines will be called off . germany 's engineering and metalworker union , ig metall , plans to put an end to strikes four weeks after eastern german auto industry workers first laid down their tools .
following 16 hours of negotiations , the trade union and employers announced on saturday morning they had failed to reach agreement in the dispute over reducing the work week from 38 to 35 hours in eastern germany .
the move would have brought practices in line with those of western germany . " the bitter truth is the strike failed , " ig metall head klaus zwickel said on saturday . he said strikes should be called off on monday .
zwickel and the union 's chief negotiator , hasso düvel , called the failure a defeat and said there was no point in continuing the strikes anymore . both union leaders and employers blamed each other for the failure to reach agreement .
" we think the employers have missed a big chance , " düvel said early saturday .
martin kannegiesser , head of the metals and engineering employers federation gesamtmetall , said the union 's proposal was unreasonable . ig metall had called for a range of working hours from 35 to 40 hours a week that would reflect the individual economic needs of the different companies .
union negotiators said the 35-hour work week could be introduced over differing timeframes , with full implementation by 2009 . but employers were reticent .
they too suggested parameters from 35 to 40 hours as well as an across-the-board reduction of working times to 37 hours in april 2005 .
but they rejected the gradual introduction of the 35-hour week and said any further harmonization with western working hours should depend on the productivity of the eastern german plants . the strikes , which involved 8,000 union members , had led to work stoppages on bmw and volkswagen assembly lines in western germany as well because necessary components from the eastern states could not be delivered . union defeat for the first time since 1954 , ig metall failed to meet its strike aims . the union will now pursue agreements with individual companies in the metal and electronics industry .
it has already completed deals with nine firms in saxony , none of which belong to employers associations .
most of the agreements foresee a full implementation of the 35-hour work week by 2009 . ig metall 's insistence on cutting working hours in the eastern german states - where nearly 18 percent of the workforce is unemployed - has been criticized by business leaders in past weeks , some of whom feared the actions could badly damage the fragile economy in the formerly communist part of germany .
some 310,000 people work are employed in the eastern german engineering and metal industry . " what ig-metall is doing in the -lsb- eastern -rsb- states is destroying jobs , " opposition christian democrat leader angela merkel told the german public television broadcaster ard last month . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ig metall strikes cripple german car production large chunks of germany ’ s proud auto industry were paralyzed monday , as strikes in the eastern part of the country meant plants in the west could not continue production .
bmw told some 10,000 autoworkers to stay at home .

11 , 2001 german director max färberböck ’ s feature film " september " was released this week .
the film is a daring collage of the effects of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on ordinary germans . as the first director to tackle september 11 in a feature-length drama , max färberböck ’ s second film after “ aimée & jaguar ” is a bold , some say brave , next step .
set in germany on sept .
11 , 2001 , “ september ” tells how the attacks in new york and washington didn ’ t only affect world events , but also changed life in germany . the film 's protagonists , played by some of germany 's finest actors , including jörg shüttauf , nina proll and justus von dohnányi , watch the events of the world trade center catastrophe unfold in front of their eyes . their reactions span a range of emotions and actions , from a young mother who tries desperately to continue running a child ’ s birthday party as if nothing has happened , to a pakistani man who invites his friends to celebrate with him at a restaurant , triggering a suspicious response in his pregnant girlfriend . an author suffers an initial bout of writer ’ s block , which then transforms itself into a surge of creative inspiration , and a police officer , who believes his life isn ’ t worth living because his excessive patriotism seriously irritates his u.s. colleagues in the fbi .
then there ’ s sandra , the television presenter , who reads the devastating news to a horrified germany against a backdrop of her own private worries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max färberböck director färberböck developed the idea for the film project just days after the terrorist attacks , setting himself the challenging task of completing the script within just four weeks .
he aimed to capture the feeling of sept .
11 while it still raged , and in order to help him stick to his self-imposed deadlines , he engaged co-authors john von düffel , sarah khan , matthias pacht and moritz rinke .
each writer took on one of the four stories which make up the film . “ all the stories in the film are within the bounds of reality .
it was a time of multiple nervous breakdowns and latent psychosis , and i have threaded this into the film , ” färberböck has said . the result is an emotionally loaded depiction of how people everywhere were ripped from the routine of their daily lives by acts of mass terror on the other side of the atlantic . unconventional approach “ september ” - which färberböck says was always going to be experimental - is a far cry from the classic three-act form of story telling .
instead , the director takes a fragmented approach , interweaving the contrasting plots and punctuating them with documentary footage to create a structure that reflects the disruption the attacks left in their wake .
opting too for a jagged visual concept , färberböck fills the screen with harsh , abrupt cuts that he uses to stress the emotional confusion of the various characters .
it is this conscious desertion from any traditional plot which lends the film the feel of a puzzle comprised of ill-fitting pieces . but for all its intent , the film is flawed .
none of the stories are strong enough to carry their weight alone , and even their sum total is too small when held against a backdrop so dramatic as that of new york and washington on sept .

the strikes that had stopped production on german assembly lines will be called off . germany 's engineering and metalworker union , ig metall , plans to put an end to strikes four weeks after eastern german auto industry workers first laid down their tools .
following 16 hours of negotiations , the trade union and employers announced on saturday morning they had failed to reach agreement in the dispute over reducing the work week from 38 to 35 hours in eastern germany .
the move would have brought practices in line with those of western germany . " the bitter truth is the strike failed , " ig metall head klaus zwickel said on saturday . he said strikes should be called off on monday .
zwickel and the union 's chief negotiator , hasso düvel , called the failure a defeat and said there was no point in continuing the strikes anymore . both union leaders and employers blamed each other for the failure to reach agreement .
" we think the employers have missed a big chance , " düvel said early saturday .
martin kannegiesser , head of the metals and engineering employers federation gesamtmetall , said the union 's proposal was unreasonable . ig metall had called for a range of working hours from 35 to 40 hours a week that would reflect the individual economic needs of the different companies .
union negotiators said the 35-hour work week could be introduced over differing timeframes , with full implementation by 2009 . but employers were reticent .
they too suggested parameters from 35 to 40 hours as well as an across-the-board reduction of working times to 37 hours in april 2005 .
but they rejected the gradual introduction of the 35-hour week and said any further harmonization with western working hours should depend on the productivity of the eastern german plants . the strikes , which involved 8,000 union members , had led to work stoppages on bmw and volkswagen assembly lines in western germany as well because necessary components from the eastern states could not be delivered . union defeat for the first time since 1954 , ig metall failed to meet its strike aims . the union will now pursue agreements with individual companies in the metal and electronics industry .
it has already completed deals with nine firms in saxony , none of which belong to employers associations .
most of the agreements foresee a full implementation of the 35-hour work week by 2009 . ig metall 's insistence on cutting working hours in the eastern german states - where nearly 18 percent of the workforce is unemployed - has been criticized by business leaders in past weeks , some of whom feared the actions could badly damage the fragile economy in the formerly communist part of germany .
some 310,000 people work are employed in the eastern german engineering and metal industry .

11 , 2001 german director max färberböck ’ s feature film " september " was released this week .
the film is a daring collage of the effects of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on ordinary germans . as the first director to tackle september 11 in a feature-length drama , max färberböck ’ s second film after “ aimée & jaguar ” is a bold , some say brave , next step .
set in germany on sept .
11 , 2001 , “ september ” tells how the attacks in new york and washington didn ’ t only affect world events , but also changed life in germany . the film 's protagonists , played by some of germany 's finest actors , including jörg shüttauf , nina proll and justus von dohnányi , watch the events of the world trade center catastrophe unfold in front of their eyes . their reactions span a range of emotions and actions , from a young mother who tries desperately to continue running a child ’ s birthday party as if nothing has happened , to a pakistani man who invites his friends to celebrate with him at a restaurant , triggering a suspicious response in his pregnant girlfriend . an author suffers an initial bout of writer ’ s block , which then transforms itself into a surge of creative inspiration , and a police officer , who believes his life isn ’ t worth living because his excessive patriotism seriously irritates his u.s. colleagues in the fbi .
then there ’ s sandra , the television presenter , who reads the devastating news to a horrified germany against a backdrop of her own private worries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max färberböck director färberböck developed the idea for the film project just days after the terrorist attacks , setting himself the challenging task of completing the script within just four weeks .
he aimed to capture the feeling of sept .
11 while it still raged , and in order to help him stick to his self-imposed deadlines , he engaged co-authors john von düffel , sarah khan , matthias pacht and moritz rinke .
each writer took on one of the four stories which make up the film . “ all the stories in the film are within the bounds of reality .
it was a time of multiple nervous breakdowns and latent psychosis , and i have threaded this into the film , ” färberböck has said . the result is an emotionally loaded depiction of how people everywhere were ripped from the routine of their daily lives by acts of mass terror on the other side of the atlantic . unconventional approach “ september ” - which färberböck says was always going to be experimental - is a far cry from the classic three-act form of story telling .
instead , the director takes a fragmented approach , interweaving the contrasting plots and punctuating them with documentary footage to create a structure that reflects the disruption the attacks left in their wake .
opting too for a jagged visual concept , färberböck fills the screen with harsh , abrupt cuts that he uses to stress the emotional confusion of the various characters .
it is this conscious desertion from any traditional plot which lends the film the feel of a puzzle comprised of ill-fitting pieces . but for all its intent , the film is flawed .
none of the stories are strong enough to carry their weight alone , and even their sum total is too small when held against a backdrop so dramatic as that of new york and washington on sept .
11 , 2001 .
the authors , it seems , focused on the detail of their individual scripts , rather than looking at the film as a whole . perhaps the biggest weakness is that none of the stories would be very different if told outside the context of the twin towers , and as none of the events in the individual stories are actually the results of the attacks , the connections seem arbitrary and hard to believe . nonetheless , the film made its debut at the cannes film festival in the category “ un certain regard , ” which in itself is an achievement , given that the number of german films that make it to the prestigious competition are few and far between . leona frommelt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing 9/11 horror to berlin the visitor count at a berlin photo exhibit featuring amateur and professional photos of new york on sept .

the strikes that had stopped production on german assembly lines will be called off . germany 's engineering and metalworker union , ig metall , plans to put an end to strikes four weeks after eastern german auto industry workers first laid down their tools .
following 16 hours of negotiations , the trade union and employers announced on saturday morning they had failed to reach agreement in the dispute over reducing the work week from 38 to 35 hours in eastern germany .
the move would have brought practices in line with those of western germany . " the bitter truth is the strike failed , " ig metall head klaus zwickel said on saturday . he said strikes should be called off on monday .
zwickel and the union 's chief negotiator , hasso düvel , called the failure a defeat and said there was no point in continuing the strikes anymore . both union leaders and employers blamed each other for the failure to reach agreement .
" we think the employers have missed a big chance , " düvel said early saturday .
martin kannegiesser , head of the metals and engineering employers federation gesamtmetall , said the union 's proposal was unreasonable . ig metall had called for a range of working hours from 35 to 40 hours a week that would reflect the individual economic needs of the different companies .
union negotiators said the 35-hour work week could be introduced over differing timeframes , with full implementation by 2009 . but employers were reticent .
they too suggested parameters from 35 to 40 hours as well as an across-the-board reduction of working times to 37 hours in april 2005 .
but they rejected the gradual introduction of the 35-hour week and said any further harmonization with western working hours should depend on the productivity of the eastern german plants . the strikes , which involved 8,000 union members , had led to work stoppages on bmw and volkswagen assembly lines in western germany as well because necessary components from the eastern states could not be delivered . union defeat for the first time since 1954 , ig metall failed to meet its strike aims . the union will now pursue agreements with individual companies in the metal and electronics industry .
it has already completed deals with nine firms in saxony , none of which belong to employers associations .
most of the agreements foresee a full implementation of the 35-hour work week by 2009 . ig metall 's insistence on cutting working hours in the eastern german states - where nearly 18 percent of the workforce is unemployed - has been criticized by business leaders in past weeks , some of whom feared the actions could badly damage the fragile economy in the formerly communist part of germany .
some 310,000 people work are employed in the eastern german engineering and metal industry . " what ig-metall is doing in the -lsb- eastern -rsb- states is destroying jobs , " opposition christian democrat leader angela merkel told the german public television broadcaster ard last month . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ig metall strikes cripple german car production large chunks of germany ’ s proud auto industry were paralyzed monday , as strikes in the eastern part of the country meant plants in the west could not continue production .

11 , 2001 german director max färberböck ’ s feature film " september " was released this week .
the film is a daring collage of the effects of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on ordinary germans . as the first director to tackle september 11 in a feature-length drama , max färberböck ’ s second film after “ aimée & jaguar ” is a bold , some say brave , next step .
set in germany on sept .
11 , 2001 , “ september ” tells how the attacks in new york and washington didn ’ t only affect world events , but also changed life in germany . the film 's protagonists , played by some of germany 's finest actors , including jörg shüttauf , nina proll and justus von dohnányi , watch the events of the world trade center catastrophe unfold in front of their eyes . their reactions span a range of emotions and actions , from a young mother who tries desperately to continue running a child ’ s birthday party as if nothing has happened , to a pakistani man who invites his friends to celebrate with him at a restaurant , triggering a suspicious response in his pregnant girlfriend . an author suffers an initial bout of writer ’ s block , which then transforms itself into a surge of creative inspiration , and a police officer , who believes his life isn ’ t worth living because his excessive patriotism seriously irritates his u.s. colleagues in the fbi .
then there ’ s sandra , the television presenter , who reads the devastating news to a horrified germany against a backdrop of her own private worries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max färberböck director färberböck developed the idea for the film project just days after the terrorist attacks , setting himself the challenging task of completing the script within just four weeks .
he aimed to capture the feeling of sept .
11 while it still raged , and in order to help him stick to his self-imposed deadlines , he engaged co-authors john von düffel , sarah khan , matthias pacht and moritz rinke .
each writer took on one of the four stories which make up the film . “ all the stories in the film are within the bounds of reality .
it was a time of multiple nervous breakdowns and latent psychosis , and i have threaded this into the film , ” färberböck has said . the result is an emotionally loaded depiction of how people everywhere were ripped from the routine of their daily lives by acts of mass terror on the other side of the atlantic . unconventional approach “ september ” - which färberböck says was always going to be experimental - is a far cry from the classic three-act form of story telling .
instead , the director takes a fragmented approach , interweaving the contrasting plots and punctuating them with documentary footage to create a structure that reflects the disruption the attacks left in their wake .
opting too for a jagged visual concept , färberböck fills the screen with harsh , abrupt cuts that he uses to stress the emotional confusion of the various characters .
it is this conscious desertion from any traditional plot which lends the film the feel of a puzzle comprised of ill-fitting pieces . but for all its intent , the film is flawed .
none of the stories are strong enough to carry their weight alone , and even their sum total is too small when held against a backdrop so dramatic as that of new york and washington on sept .
11 , 2001 .
the authors , it seems , focused on the detail of their individual scripts , rather than looking at the film as a whole . perhaps the biggest weakness is that none of the stories would be very different if told outside the context of the twin towers , and as none of the events in the individual stories are actually the results of the attacks , the connections seem arbitrary and hard to believe . nonetheless , the film made its debut at the cannes film festival in the category “ un certain regard , ” which in itself is an achievement , given that the number of german films that make it to the prestigious competition are few and far between . leona frommelt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing 9/11 horror to berlin the visitor count at a berlin photo exhibit featuring amateur and professional photos of new york on sept .

11 terrorist attacks on ordinary germans . as the first director to tackle september 11 in a feature-length drama , max färberböck ’ s second film after “ aimée & jaguar ” is a bold , some say brave , next step .
set in germany on sept .
11 , 2001 , “ september ” tells how the attacks in new york and washington didn ’ t only affect world events , but also changed life in germany . the film 's protagonists , played by some of germany 's finest actors , including jörg shüttauf , nina proll and justus von dohnányi , watch the events of the world trade center catastrophe unfold in front of their eyes . their reactions span a range of emotions and actions , from a young mother who tries desperately to continue running a child ’ s birthday party as if nothing has happened , to a pakistani man who invites his friends to celebrate with him at a restaurant , triggering a suspicious response in his pregnant girlfriend . an author suffers an initial bout of writer ’ s block , which then transforms itself into a surge of creative inspiration , and a police officer , who believes his life isn ’ t worth living because his excessive patriotism seriously irritates his u.s. colleagues in the fbi .

11 while it still raged , and in order to help him stick to his self-imposed deadlines , he engaged co-authors john von düffel , sarah khan , matthias pacht and moritz rinke .
each writer took on one of the four stories which make up the film . “ all the stories in the film are within the bounds of reality .
it was a time of multiple nervous breakdowns and latent psychosis , and i have threaded this into the film , ” färberböck has said . the result is an emotionally loaded depiction of how people everywhere were ripped from the routine of their daily lives by acts of mass terror on the other side of the atlantic . unconventional approach “ september ” - which färberböck says was always going to be experimental - is a far cry from the classic three-act form of story telling .
instead , the director takes a fragmented approach , interweaving the contrasting plots and punctuating them with documentary footage to create a structure that reflects the disruption the attacks left in their wake .
opting too for a jagged visual concept , färberböck fills the screen with harsh , abrupt cuts that he uses to stress the emotional confusion of the various characters .
it is this conscious desertion from any traditional plot which lends the film the feel of a puzzle comprised of ill-fitting pieces . but for all its intent , the film is flawed .

11 , 2001 german director max färberböck ’ s feature film " september " was released this week .
the film is a daring collage of the effects of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on ordinary germans . as the first director to tackle september 11 in a feature-length drama , max färberböck ’ s second film after “ aimée & jaguar ” is a bold , some say brave , next step .
set in germany on sept .
11 , 2001 , “ september ” tells how the attacks in new york and washington didn ’ t only affect world events , but also changed life in germany . the film 's protagonists , played by some of germany 's finest actors , including jörg shüttauf , nina proll and justus von dohnányi , watch the events of the world trade center catastrophe unfold in front of their eyes . their reactions span a range of emotions and actions , from a young mother who tries desperately to continue running a child ’ s birthday party as if nothing has happened , to a pakistani man who invites his friends to celebrate with him at a restaurant , triggering a suspicious response in his pregnant girlfriend . an author suffers an initial bout of writer ’ s block , which then transforms itself into a surge of creative inspiration , and a police officer , who believes his life isn ’ t worth living because his excessive patriotism seriously irritates his u.s. colleagues in the fbi .
then there ’ s sandra , the television presenter , who reads the devastating news to a horrified germany against a backdrop of her own private worries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max färberböck director färberböck developed the idea for the film project just days after the terrorist attacks , setting himself the challenging task of completing the script within just four weeks .
he aimed to capture the feeling of sept .
11 while it still raged , and in order to help him stick to his self-imposed deadlines , he engaged co-authors john von düffel , sarah khan , matthias pacht and moritz rinke .
each writer took on one of the four stories which make up the film . “ all the stories in the film are within the bounds of reality .
it was a time of multiple nervous breakdowns and latent psychosis , and i have threaded this into the film , ” färberböck has said . the result is an emotionally loaded depiction of how people everywhere were ripped from the routine of their daily lives by acts of mass terror on the other side of the atlantic . unconventional approach “ september ” - which färberböck says was always going to be experimental - is a far cry from the classic three-act form of story telling .
instead , the director takes a fragmented approach , interweaving the contrasting plots and punctuating them with documentary footage to create a structure that reflects the disruption the attacks left in their wake .
opting too for a jagged visual concept , färberböck fills the screen with harsh , abrupt cuts that he uses to stress the emotional confusion of the various characters .
it is this conscious desertion from any traditional plot which lends the film the feel of a puzzle comprised of ill-fitting pieces . but for all its intent , the film is flawed .

the strikes that had stopped production on german assembly lines will be called off . germany 's engineering and metalworker union , ig metall , plans to put an end to strikes four weeks after eastern german auto industry workers first laid down their tools .
following 16 hours of negotiations , the trade union and employers announced on saturday morning they had failed to reach agreement in the dispute over reducing the work week from 38 to 35 hours in eastern germany .
the move would have brought practices in line with those of western germany . " the bitter truth is the strike failed , " ig metall head klaus zwickel said on saturday . he said strikes should be called off on monday .
zwickel and the union 's chief negotiator , hasso düvel , called the failure a defeat and said there was no point in continuing the strikes anymore . both union leaders and employers blamed each other for the failure to reach agreement .
" we think the employers have missed a big chance , " düvel said early saturday .
martin kannegiesser , head of the metals and engineering employers federation gesamtmetall , said the union 's proposal was unreasonable . ig metall had called for a range of working hours from 35 to 40 hours a week that would reflect the individual economic needs of the different companies .
union negotiators said the 35-hour work week could be introduced over differing timeframes , with full implementation by 2009 . but employers were reticent .
they too suggested parameters from 35 to 40 hours as well as an across-the-board reduction of working times to 37 hours in april 2005 .
but they rejected the gradual introduction of the 35-hour week and said any further harmonization with western working hours should depend on the productivity of the eastern german plants . the strikes , which involved 8,000 union members , had led to work stoppages on bmw and volkswagen assembly lines in western germany as well because necessary components from the eastern states could not be delivered . union defeat for the first time since 1954 , ig metall failed to meet its strike aims . the union will now pursue agreements with individual companies in the metal and electronics industry .
it has already completed deals with nine firms in saxony , none of which belong to employers associations .
most of the agreements foresee a full implementation of the 35-hour work week by 2009 . ig metall 's insistence on cutting working hours in the eastern german states - where nearly 18 percent of the workforce is unemployed - has been criticized by business leaders in past weeks , some of whom feared the actions could badly damage the fragile economy in the formerly communist part of germany .
some 310,000 people work are employed in the eastern german engineering and metal industry .

the strikes that had stopped production on german assembly lines will be called off . germany 's engineering and metalworker union , ig metall , plans to put an end to strikes four weeks after eastern german auto industry workers first laid down their tools .
following 16 hours of negotiations , the trade union and employers announced on saturday morning they had failed to reach agreement in the dispute over reducing the work week from 38 to 35 hours in eastern germany .
the move would have brought practices in line with those of western germany . " the bitter truth is the strike failed , " ig metall head klaus zwickel said on saturday . he said strikes should be called off on monday .
zwickel and the union 's chief negotiator , hasso düvel , called the failure a defeat and said there was no point in continuing the strikes anymore . both union leaders and employers blamed each other for the failure to reach agreement .
" we think the employers have missed a big chance , " düvel said early saturday .
martin kannegiesser , head of the metals and engineering employers federation gesamtmetall , said the union 's proposal was unreasonable . ig metall had called for a range of working hours from 35 to 40 hours a week that would reflect the individual economic needs of the different companies .
union negotiators said the 35-hour work week could be introduced over differing timeframes , with full implementation by 2009 . but employers were reticent .
they too suggested parameters from 35 to 40 hours as well as an across-the-board reduction of working times to 37 hours in april 2005 .
but they rejected the gradual introduction of the 35-hour week and said any further harmonization with western working hours should depend on the productivity of the eastern german plants . the strikes , which involved 8,000 union members , had led to work stoppages on bmw and volkswagen assembly lines in western germany as well because necessary components from the eastern states could not be delivered . union defeat for the first time since 1954 , ig metall failed to meet its strike aims . the union will now pursue agreements with individual companies in the metal and electronics industry .
it has already completed deals with nine firms in saxony , none of which belong to employers associations .
most of the agreements foresee a full implementation of the 35-hour work week by 2009 . ig metall 's insistence on cutting working hours in the eastern german states - where nearly 18 percent of the workforce is unemployed - has been criticized by business leaders in past weeks , some of whom feared the actions could badly damage the fragile economy in the formerly communist part of germany .
some 310,000 people work are employed in the eastern german engineering and metal industry . " what ig-metall is doing in the -lsb- eastern -rsb- states is destroying jobs , " opposition christian democrat leader angela merkel told the german public television broadcaster ard last month . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ig metall strikes cripple german car production large chunks of germany ’ s proud auto industry were paralyzed monday , as strikes in the eastern part of the country meant plants in the west could not continue production .

11 , 2001 german director max färberböck ’ s feature film " september " was released this week .
the film is a daring collage of the effects of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on ordinary germans . as the first director to tackle september 11 in a feature-length drama , max färberböck ’ s second film after “ aimée & jaguar ” is a bold , some say brave , next step .
set in germany on sept .
11 , 2001 , “ september ” tells how the attacks in new york and washington didn ’ t only affect world events , but also changed life in germany . the film 's protagonists , played by some of germany 's finest actors , including jörg shüttauf , nina proll and justus von dohnányi , watch the events of the world trade center catastrophe unfold in front of their eyes . their reactions span a range of emotions and actions , from a young mother who tries desperately to continue running a child ’ s birthday party as if nothing has happened , to a pakistani man who invites his friends to celebrate with him at a restaurant , triggering a suspicious response in his pregnant girlfriend . an author suffers an initial bout of writer ’ s block , which then transforms itself into a surge of creative inspiration , and a police officer , who believes his life isn ’ t worth living because his excessive patriotism seriously irritates his u.s. colleagues in the fbi .
then there ’ s sandra , the television presenter , who reads the devastating news to a horrified germany against a backdrop of her own private worries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max färberböck director färberböck developed the idea for the film project just days after the terrorist attacks , setting himself the challenging task of completing the script within just four weeks .
he aimed to capture the feeling of sept .
11 while it still raged , and in order to help him stick to his self-imposed deadlines , he engaged co-authors john von düffel , sarah khan , matthias pacht and moritz rinke .
each writer took on one of the four stories which make up the film . “ all the stories in the film are within the bounds of reality .
it was a time of multiple nervous breakdowns and latent psychosis , and i have threaded this into the film , ” färberböck has said . the result is an emotionally loaded depiction of how people everywhere were ripped from the routine of their daily lives by acts of mass terror on the other side of the atlantic . unconventional approach “ september ” - which färberböck says was always going to be experimental - is a far cry from the classic three-act form of story telling .
instead , the director takes a fragmented approach , interweaving the contrasting plots and punctuating them with documentary footage to create a structure that reflects the disruption the attacks left in their wake .
opting too for a jagged visual concept , färberböck fills the screen with harsh , abrupt cuts that he uses to stress the emotional confusion of the various characters .
it is this conscious desertion from any traditional plot which lends the film the feel of a puzzle comprised of ill-fitting pieces . but for all its intent , the film is flawed .
none of the stories are strong enough to carry their weight alone , and even their sum total is too small when held against a backdrop so dramatic as that of new york and washington on sept .
11 , 2001 .
the authors , it seems , focused on the detail of their individual scripts , rather than looking at the film as a whole . perhaps the biggest weakness is that none of the stories would be very different if told outside the context of the twin towers , and as none of the events in the individual stories are actually the results of the attacks , the connections seem arbitrary and hard to believe . nonetheless , the film made its debut at the cannes film festival in the category “ un certain regard , ” which in itself is an achievement , given that the number of german films that make it to the prestigious competition are few and far between . leona frommelt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing 9/11 horror to berlin the visitor count at a berlin photo exhibit featuring amateur and professional photos of new york on sept .

the strikes that had stopped production on german assembly lines will be called off . germany 's engineering and metalworker union , ig metall , plans to put an end to strikes four weeks after eastern german auto industry workers first laid down their tools .
following 16 hours of negotiations , the trade union and employers announced on saturday morning they had failed to reach agreement in the dispute over reducing the work week from 38 to 35 hours in eastern germany .
the move would have brought practices in line with those of western germany . " the bitter truth is the strike failed , " ig metall head klaus zwickel said on saturday . he said strikes should be called off on monday .
zwickel and the union 's chief negotiator , hasso düvel , called the failure a defeat and said there was no point in continuing the strikes anymore . both union leaders and employers blamed each other for the failure to reach agreement .
" we think the employers have missed a big chance , " düvel said early saturday .
martin kannegiesser , head of the metals and engineering employers federation gesamtmetall , said the union 's proposal was unreasonable . ig metall had called for a range of working hours from 35 to 40 hours a week that would reflect the individual economic needs of the different companies .
union negotiators said the 35-hour work week could be introduced over differing timeframes , with full implementation by 2009 . but employers were reticent .
they too suggested parameters from 35 to 40 hours as well as an across-the-board reduction of working times to 37 hours in april 2005 .
but they rejected the gradual introduction of the 35-hour week and said any further harmonization with western working hours should depend on the productivity of the eastern german plants . the strikes , which involved 8,000 union members , had led to work stoppages on bmw and volkswagen assembly lines in western germany as well because necessary components from the eastern states could not be delivered . union defeat for the first time since 1954 , ig metall failed to meet its strike aims . the union will now pursue agreements with individual companies in the metal and electronics industry .
it has already completed deals with nine firms in saxony , none of which belong to employers associations .
most of the agreements foresee a full implementation of the 35-hour work week by 2009 . ig metall 's insistence on cutting working hours in the eastern german states - where nearly 18 percent of the workforce is unemployed - has been criticized by business leaders in past weeks , some of whom feared the actions could badly damage the fragile economy in the formerly communist part of germany .
some 310,000 people work are employed in the eastern german engineering and metal industry . " what ig-metall is doing in the -lsb- eastern -rsb- states is destroying jobs , " opposition christian democrat leader angela merkel told the german public television broadcaster ard last month . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ig metall strikes cripple german car production large chunks of germany ’ s proud auto industry were paralyzed monday , as strikes in the eastern part of the country meant plants in the west could not continue production .

the strikes that had stopped production on german assembly lines will be called off . germany 's engineering and metalworker union , ig metall , plans to put an end to strikes four weeks after eastern german auto industry workers first laid down their tools .
following 16 hours of negotiations , the trade union and employers announced on saturday morning they had failed to reach agreement in the dispute over reducing the work week from 38 to 35 hours in eastern germany .
the move would have brought practices in line with those of western germany . " the bitter truth is the strike failed , " ig metall head klaus zwickel said on saturday . he said strikes should be called off on monday .
zwickel and the union 's chief negotiator , hasso düvel , called the failure a defeat and said there was no point in continuing the strikes anymore . both union leaders and employers blamed each other for the failure to reach agreement .
" we think the employers have missed a big chance , " düvel said early saturday .
martin kannegiesser , head of the metals and engineering employers federation gesamtmetall , said the union 's proposal was unreasonable . ig metall had called for a range of working hours from 35 to 40 hours a week that would reflect the individual economic needs of the different companies .
union negotiators said the 35-hour work week could be introduced over differing timeframes , with full implementation by 2009 . but employers were reticent .
they too suggested parameters from 35 to 40 hours as well as an across-the-board reduction of working times to 37 hours in april 2005 .
but they rejected the gradual introduction of the 35-hour week and said any further harmonization with western working hours should depend on the productivity of the eastern german plants . the strikes , which involved 8,000 union members , had led to work stoppages on bmw and volkswagen assembly lines in western germany as well because necessary components from the eastern states could not be delivered . union defeat for the first time since 1954 , ig metall failed to meet its strike aims . the union will now pursue agreements with individual companies in the metal and electronics industry .
it has already completed deals with nine firms in saxony , none of which belong to employers associations .
most of the agreements foresee a full implementation of the 35-hour work week by 2009 . ig metall 's insistence on cutting working hours in the eastern german states - where nearly 18 percent of the workforce is unemployed - has been criticized by business leaders in past weeks , some of whom feared the actions could badly damage the fragile economy in the formerly communist part of germany .

11 , 2001 german director max färberböck ’ s feature film " september " was released this week .
the film is a daring collage of the effects of the sept .
11 terrorist attacks on ordinary germans . as the first director to tackle september 11 in a feature-length drama , max färberböck ’ s second film after “ aimée & jaguar ” is a bold , some say brave , next step .
set in germany on sept .
11 , 2001 , “ september ” tells how the attacks in new york and washington didn ’ t only affect world events , but also changed life in germany . the film 's protagonists , played by some of germany 's finest actors , including jörg shüttauf , nina proll and justus von dohnányi , watch the events of the world trade center catastrophe unfold in front of their eyes . their reactions span a range of emotions and actions , from a young mother who tries desperately to continue running a child ’ s birthday party as if nothing has happened , to a pakistani man who invites his friends to celebrate with him at a restaurant , triggering a suspicious response in his pregnant girlfriend . an author suffers an initial bout of writer ’ s block , which then transforms itself into a surge of creative inspiration , and a police officer , who believes his life isn ’ t worth living because his excessive patriotism seriously irritates his u.s. colleagues in the fbi .
then there ’ s sandra , the television presenter , who reads the devastating news to a horrified germany against a backdrop of her own private worries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : max färberböck director färberböck developed the idea for the film project just days after the terrorist attacks , setting himself the challenging task of completing the script within just four weeks .
he aimed to capture the feeling of sept .
11 while it still raged , and in order to help him stick to his self-imposed deadlines , he engaged co-authors john von düffel , sarah khan , matthias pacht and moritz rinke .
each writer took on one of the four stories which make up the film . “ all the stories in the film are within the bounds of reality .
it was a time of multiple nervous breakdowns and latent psychosis , and i have threaded this into the film , ” färberböck has said . the result is an emotionally loaded depiction of how people everywhere were ripped from the routine of their daily lives by acts of mass terror on the other side of the atlantic . unconventional approach “ september ” - which färberböck says was always going to be experimental - is a far cry from the classic three-act form of story telling .
instead , the director takes a fragmented approach , interweaving the contrasting plots and punctuating them with documentary footage to create a structure that reflects the disruption the attacks left in their wake .
opting too for a jagged visual concept , färberböck fills the screen with harsh , abrupt cuts that he uses to stress the emotional confusion of the various characters .
it is this conscious desertion from any traditional plot which lends the film the feel of a puzzle comprised of ill-fitting pieces . but for all its intent , the film is flawed .
none of the stories are strong enough to carry their weight alone , and even their sum total is too small when held against a backdrop so dramatic as that of new york and washington on sept .
11 , 2001 .
the authors , it seems , focused on the detail of their individual scripts , rather than looking at the film as a whole . perhaps the biggest weakness is that none of the stories would be very different if told outside the context of the twin towers , and as none of the events in the individual stories are actually the results of the attacks , the connections seem arbitrary and hard to believe . nonetheless , the film made its debut at the cannes film festival in the category “ un certain regard , ” which in itself is an achievement , given that the number of german films that make it to the prestigious competition are few and far between . leona frommelt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bringing 9/11 horror to berlin the visitor count at a berlin photo exhibit featuring amateur and professional photos of new york on sept .

the strikes that had stopped production on german assembly lines will be called off . germany 's engineering and metalworker union , ig metall , plans to put an end to strikes four weeks after eastern german auto industry workers first laid down their tools .
following 16 hours of negotiations , the trade union and employers announced on saturday morning they had failed to reach agreement in the dispute over reducing the work week from 38 to 35 hours in eastern germany .
the move would have brought practices in line with those of western germany . " the bitter truth is the strike failed , " ig metall head klaus zwickel said on saturday . he said strikes should be called off on monday .
zwickel and the union 's chief negotiator , hasso düvel , called the failure a defeat and said there was no point in continuing the strikes anymore . both union leaders and employers blamed each other for the failure to reach agreement .
" we think the employers have missed a big chance , " düvel said early saturday .
martin kannegiesser , head of the metals and engineering employers federation gesamtmetall , said the union 's proposal was unreasonable . ig metall had called for a range of working hours from 35 to 40 hours a week that would reflect the individual economic needs of the different companies .
union negotiators said the 35-hour work week could be introduced over differing timeframes , with full implementation by 2009 . but employers were reticent .
they too suggested parameters from 35 to 40 hours as well as an across-the-board reduction of working times to 37 hours in april 2005 .
but they rejected the gradual introduction of the 35-hour week and said any further harmonization with western working hours should depend on the productivity of the eastern german plants . the strikes , which involved 8,000 union members , had led to work stoppages on bmw and volkswagen assembly lines in western germany as well because necessary components from the eastern states could not be delivered . union defeat for the first time since 1954 , ig metall failed to meet its strike aims . the union will now pursue agreements with individual companies in the metal and electronics industry .
it has already completed deals with nine firms in saxony , none of which belong to employers associations .
most of the agreements foresee a full implementation of the 35-hour work week by 2009 . ig metall 's insistence on cutting working hours in the eastern german states - where nearly 18 percent of the workforce is unemployed - has been criticized by business leaders in past weeks , some of whom feared the actions could badly damage the fragile economy in the formerly communist part of germany .

britain 's presence in southern iraq is suddenly looking a lot more shaky .
the commanding officer in the area , major-general peter wall , said the violence appeared to have stemmed from a misunderstanding , but also promised that those who killed his troops would be brought to justice .
the confrontation has raised questions about the number of british troops on the ground and the rules of engagement .
but whether military intervention fails or succeeds depends on more fundamental factors .

they raped women and girls and cut off the hands and feet of children .
britain decided to send in a military force in may 2000 and , along with un peacekeepers have managed to bring security to the country and put rebel leaders in jail .

" there was a peace agreement , there was already a legitimately elected government which did n't have to be cobbled together , there was acceptance from the people and the political elite and there was also a clear mandate . "
afghanistan woes president george bush 's proud boast that america had liberated the afghan people from tyranny and saved them from starvation is starting to look rather hollow 18 months on .
the food supply is better this year - but only because the worst drought in living memory is over .
very few afghans would like to see the return of the taleban .
but many are concerned about worsening security and the failure of the us and un to restore justice or democracy in afghanistan .
insecurity may mean the postponement of next year 's elections , the un warns .
aid agencies are also worried .
eighty have warned about their ability to work in many parts of the country , after a sharp rise in attacks over the last two months .
catherine hunt from care international agencies says there have already been temporary pull-outs of staff and travel bans to some areas .
" that 's why we 're trying to heighten the call to the international community , " she said , " so that we do n't get to the point where it would be impossible for some of the aid agencies to function at all . "
the agencies would like international peacekeepers to venture beyond kabul , where they have been confined since they arrived in afghanistan in january 2002 . "
the rule of law is not there " lakhdar brahimi head of un , afghanistan such calls have been made repeatedly by the un , aid agencies , the afghan president and afghan civilians , but have always fallen on deaf ears .
meanwhile , it looks like being another bumper opium harvest this year and attacks by the taleban are also on the rise .
security failure the current government is also falling down on the issue of free speech , the un says .
the head of the un in afghanistan , lakhdar brahimi , who was one of the main architects of the post-taleban settlement , has said the international community failed afghans .
" the rule of law is not there .
the afghan is not secure in his house , he is not secure in his farm .
" i think both the afghan government and the international community have failed the ordinary afghan . "
many observers would say mr brahimi and the united states should take a large measure of responsibility for the current situation .
complex process the us first armed warlords from the northern alliance to fight the taleban , and then allowed them to keep any territory which they seized in the 2001 campaign .
the un and us both welcomed factional leaders into the afghan government and have failed to disarm or demobilise fighters even in kabul .
" the current problems in afghanistan were very predictable , " says jolyon leslie , who worked for many years for the un in afghanistan and then iraq .
he recently finished a comparative study on peacekeeping for king 's college , london .
" you do n't carve up a country into a dozen plus factions and then assume it 's going to be a seamless process to do disarmament and reintegration of fighters ..
" it 's a complex process . "
mr leslie thinks the failures in afghanistan are part of a wider pattern .
" it seems consistently that over the last four or five large peacekeeping operations of the un , there has been a failure to acknowledge that you need to fill the justice gap , the rule of law gap , you need to look at the judiciary very quickly , but even before then , you need to look at security reform . "
and afghanistan , says mr leslie , is a lot more complicated than iraq .
colonial lessons after the violence of tuesday , people are starting to wonder how and when british troops might leave iraq .
uk conservative leader ian duncan smith has asked prime minister tony blair what his exit strategy is .
dan plesch of the royal united services institute believes the whole british and american approach to military intervention is blunt and far too crisis-driven .
we carry on trading arms , buying oil or diamonds from troubled countries , he says .
then , when violence erupts , we act with the only tool in our box - military force .
" if the riot squad was the only form of policing we had in london or manchester , they would be out every day .
" in victorian england , we invented the police because the army could n't cope ; we need to grow up and find other ways of dealing with troubles in the world . "
mr plesch believes britain could set up special teams for monitoring and conflict resolution , think about funding public access tv to broadcast to trouble spots and think about forming military police or paramilitary forces , " which were used to some degree in the empire and have a policing outlook on the world . "
activist and historian mark curtis - author of the book web of deceit - believes there are other lessons to be learned from britain 's colonial history .
past interventions , he says , were also publicly justified in lofty terms , such as freeing people from communism and tyranny .
looking at now-released cabinet records concerning the invasion of suez -lrb- 1956 -rrb- , the us and british-supported overthrow of iranian prime minister mohammad mossadeq -lrb- 1953 -rrb- and the overthrow of the elected government of british guiana -lrb- 1953 -rrb- , mr curtis finds talk in private only of oil and other strategic interests .
" britain 's role , " he alleges , " remains an essentially imperial one - to act as junior partner to us global power " .
whether historians look back on the military intervention in iraq as benevolent or tyrannical may well depend on american and british actions over the coming months .

thich quang do , 74 , was allowed to leave his monastery on friday , vietnamese media said .
mr do is the deputy leader of the unified buddhist church , which is banned in vietnam .
observers said the move was more likely an attempt to win international respect than a genuine shift towards reconciliation with the church .
surprise mr do , a monk , was put under house arrest at his pagoda in june , 2001 , after calling for democratic change .
he was due to be freed in september , and the timing of his release came as a surprise .
" the decision -lsb- to free mr do -rsb- was made out of the party and state 's humanitarian policies that upheld great national unity and to meet the aspiration of ho chi minh city chapter of the buddhist church of vietnam , " the vietnam news daily newspaper said .
the state-sanctioned buddhist church supplanted the unified buddhist church of vietnam -lrb- ubcv -rrb- in 1981 .
mr do 's release follows an historic meeting in april between the head of the buddhist church and the vietnamese prime minister , pham van khai .
however , last september an eu delegation was refused permission to visit him .
the paris-based international buddhist information bureau -lrb- ibib -rrb- welcomed mr do 's release .
" we are delighted vietnam has finally given in to international pressure .
we have been waiting for this for so long , " said ibib president vo van ai .

they took to the roof at about 1900 bst on friday , and the authorities were still trying to end the protest on saturday morning .
a northern ireland office spokeswoman said they were a mix of republican , loyalist and non-paramilitary inmates .
it is believed that their protest is about having to share cells .
but sources at the prison said only about four of those in the protest actually shared cells .
all visits to the jail have been suspended for saturday , the spokeswoman said .
' inhumane ' conditions at about the time the protest started , army technical officers were called to the scene to deal with a suspect bomb which turned out to be a hoax .
investigations into the suspicious object meant a group of 15 prisoners in the exercise yard were cut off from the main building for a time , but they have since returned to their cells , the spokeswoman said .
finlay spratt , of the prison officers association , said they warned the northern ireland office two weeks ago such a protest could happen if the prison intake increased .
we have warned them repeatedly but they choose to ignore our advice prison officers association " we , as prison officers who have quite an experience of dealing with prisoners in the northern ireland prison service have been continually saying to management that their policy of doubling these prisoners up is actually going to lead to what is happening .
" we have warned them repeatedly but they choose to ignore our advice " .
about 30 people waving loyalist flags gathered outside the prison but the crowd dispersed before midnight .
frankie gallagher of the ulster political research group , which has links with the ulster defence association , spoke of growing tensions recently within the prison .
