russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .
the unfcc has also chimed in with words of encouragement for the putin government .
" there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that is both economically attractive and at the same time , climate-friendly , " the executive secretary of the u.n. agency , joke-waller hunter , told deutsche welle ahead of putin ’ s announcement on monday .
but despite such urging , putin refuses to get down from the fence and make a decision on ratification .
replying to critics on monday , putin said sarcastically , " people say we are a northern country and a temperature two to three degrees warmer would not be scary , maybe it would be good ...

russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .
the unfcc has also chimed in with words of encouragement for the putin government .
" there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that is both economically attractive and at the same time , climate-friendly , " the executive secretary of the u.n. agency , joke-waller hunter , told deutsche welle ahead of putin ’ s announcement on monday .
but despite such urging , putin refuses to get down from the fence and make a decision on ratification .
replying to critics on monday , putin said sarcastically , " people say we are a northern country and a temperature two to three degrees warmer would not be scary , maybe it would be good ...
we would have to spend less money on fur coats and other warm clothes .

power is being restored in italy following sunday 's massive blackout - the fourth major western power cut in two months .
now many in germany are wondering if it could happen here . following an accident on a power supply line in switzerland , it was only a matter of seconds before grid failure spread , leaving italy in darkness on sunday night .
germany 's energy providers reacted quickly , taking measures to prevent the power outage from affecting the german network . according to johannes altmeppen , spokesman for the country 's third largest energy company , vattenfall europe , extra power pumps were immediately activated to use up excess energy , preventing a power surge beyond the normal network frequency of 50 hertz . germany better prepared so was germany just lucky this time ?
or is the german network superior to those in north america , london and scandinavia , all places which , like italy , have suffered major outages recently ? altmeppen says it is .
" italy did n't exactly come as a surprise , " he told dw-world .
" italy does n't produce enough energy for its needs , so it has to import power , mainly from france and switzerland , and that 's not good .
here in germany , we produce enough energy , we have enough reserves , and we have a wide network so we 're not dependent on one or two main generators . " germany 's energy companies have been reassuring worried consumers ever since the blackout that hit north america in august .
such an extreme power outage ca n't happen here , they say . the german grid is so close-knit , that if there were a power outage , another generator would kick in to fill the gap .
and if multiple facilities were to malfunction , generators in neighboring european countries would provide germany with power . causes still unknown german energy officials still do n't know exactly what caused the blackout in north america - they say that american officials are being cautious in how much information they release in their statements . the cause of the power outages in london and scandinavia have n't been explained yet either , as investigations are still going on .
italian officials disagree over who is to blame for their blackout .
in each case , terrorist activity has been dismissed . terrorist motives ? but konstantin staschus , the director of germany 's association of network operators -lrb- verband der netzbetreiber -rrb- says the question is still being asked : could terrorists succeed in bringing an entire country to a standstill if they were to gain access to the power supply via the internet ? " energy providers are asking themselves that question , not just because of the threat of terrorism , but also because of the threat from internet viruses and worms , " staschus said .
he adds that such a situation in germany is highly unlikely , because the computer networks that direct the energy flow operate independently of the internet . for johannes altmeppen of vattenfall europe , raising the terrorist alarm is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction . " we 're constantly checking the safety and security of our networks , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2003 russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions goes up in smoke unless russia ratifies it .
russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .
the unfcc has also chimed in with words of encouragement for the putin government .
" there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that is both economically attractive and at the same time , climate-friendly , " the executive secretary of the u.n. agency , joke-waller hunter , told deutsche welle ahead of putin ’ s announcement on monday .
but despite such urging , putin refuses to get down from the fence and make a decision on ratification .
replying to critics on monday , putin said sarcastically , " people say we are a northern country and a temperature two to three degrees warmer would not be scary , maybe it would be good ...
we would have to spend less money on fur coats and other warm clothes .

economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year -lrb- july 3 , 2003 -rrb- .

now that u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have patched things up , what 's going on with their two countries ' economic relations ?
deutsche welle 's rolf wenkel offers his reflections . no matter how unfounded and pointless a war may be , if it is waged by americans , the u.s. population always reacts patriotically .
so it came as no surprise that there was an outcry in the german media in the spring .
since german chancellor schröder and french president chirac did n't want to help bush in iraq , the newsmakers lamented , the americans were sure to boycott our fine european products . imprudent archconservative american senators confirmed their fears and issued the calls for boycotts .
and the german media quickly dug up corresponding stories , from the nosedive in sales of french cheese and red wine in the united states , to renaming " french fries " " freedom fries , " to the bavarian company keim that suddenly lost the privilege to coat the pentagon with its special mineral paints . senator steve latourette , - does n't sound all that american , could it be that his grandfather was french ? - a republican from ohio , convinced congress that german paints were not appropriate for the pentagon during wartime , what with the germans on the wrong side . it was definitely a bitter setback for german-american economic relations , despite the fact that keim paints already bedecked the capitol , the new york stock exchange and arlington house at arlington national cemetery near washington .
the firm had even touched up the pentagon 's western façade after one of the planes flew into it on september 11 . strangely quiet since then the experts and business functionaries who tried to persuade us that chancellor schröder damaged german-american business ties with his policies on iraq have been strangely quiet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.09.2003 connex 's german presence expands with sylt route großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in 2005 , beach lovers can take connex trains to sylt as the deutsche bahn struggles with negative headlines , french-owned connex muscles in on as much of the german rail giant 's turf as possible . a pricing system fiasco , further job cuts , compeititon from low-cost airlines , delayed trains , empty compartments and yet more red ink – these are the sorts of headlines deutsche bahn has been making lately .
increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .
although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex train in berlin but the group denies that it intends to try to compete with deutsche bahn in high-speed traffic .
" we have a regional train concept , with our product interconnex .
we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .
although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex train in berlin but the group denies that it intends to try to compete with deutsche bahn in high-speed traffic .
" we have a regional train concept , with our product interconnex .
we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex train in berlin but the group denies that it intends to try to compete with deutsche bahn in high-speed traffic .
" we have a regional train concept , with our product interconnex .
we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

deutsche welle 's john hay spoke with joke-waller hunter , executive secretary of the unfccc about how russia could profit from adopting the kyoto protocol and the impact of global warming . here in europe and in the northern hemisphere in general people have seen an extremely hot summer .
it 's been billed as the hottest summer in 2000 years by some .
does this mean that more people now accept the fact that climate change is happening and that it is being caused by human kind ?
the scientists have already predicted in their models that we will have more extreme weather events in the years to come .
we had the floods in 2002 , the heat wave in europe this year - these are the type of extreme weather events that climate scientists are predicting .
so it certainly raises awareness for the issues .
it draws the attention of politicians to the issue .
i do n't think you would find a scientist who would really say that this is all due to the human impact on the climate , but it certainly helps to get it high on the agenda .
but has n't it been a sort of wake-up call ?
have n't people been coming to you now and saying " we 've doubted the science up to now but now it 's quite obvious that climate change is taking place " ?
people do make those remarks and also many politicians are now aware that this is a very serious issue .
the impacts are not only felt in the developing countries , which are the most vulnerable to climate change - given that their food production is under threat if the climate changes - but they also feel in european countries that something is happening to the climate and that it has huge economic impacts as well as impacts on daily life .
now , there are people in russia who actually welcome climate change , since they say that russia , as a cold country , can do with a little more warmth , that it ca n't do any harm if the temperature rises and that it could actually help increase agricultural output .
what do you say to this ?
well , i think the russians are really going through a very elaborate process of cost- benefit analysis , of which agricultural productivity is one element .
others being what it means for energy exports of russia and energy use in russia .
generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .
russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?
well , the kyoto protocol would enter into force 90 days after the russians have ratified it and have made it clear to the united nations in new york .
so , if we count the 90 days , it 's unlikely because they should have made their move in new york before the 13th of september .
it 's unlikely that when we have our conference of the parties in milan in early december that the protocol will have entered into force .
it would be quite important that we know at the time of the milan meeting when it will enter into force .
we are still quite confident that the russians will move at such a pace that at milan we will know when the protocol will come into force .
that would give an enormously positive signal to the conference , to the parties and to the meeting and would really make people even more aware of the need to implement , what they have agreed in an international context .
and if the russians fail to ratify altogether , what would that mean ?
that 's what is normally referred to as the plan b , which we don ’ t want to think about , but if the kyoto protocol does not enter into force in the very near future , i think the risk of climate fatigue may kick in . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

now , there are people in russia who actually welcome climate change , since they say that russia , as a cold country , can do with a little more warmth , that it ca n't do any harm if the temperature rises and that it could actually help increase agricultural output .
what do you say to this ?
well , i think the russians are really going through a very elaborate process of cost- benefit analysis , of which agricultural productivity is one element .
others being what it means for energy exports of russia and energy use in russia .
generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .
russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?
well , the kyoto protocol would enter into force 90 days after the russians have ratified it and have made it clear to the united nations in new york .
so , if we count the 90 days , it 's unlikely because they should have made their move in new york before the 13th of september .
it 's unlikely that when we have our conference of the parties in milan in early december that the protocol will have entered into force .
it would be quite important that we know at the time of the milan meeting when it will enter into force .
we are still quite confident that the russians will move at such a pace that at milan we will know when the protocol will come into force .
that would give an enormously positive signal to the conference , to the parties and to the meeting and would really make people even more aware of the need to implement , what they have agreed in an international context .
and if the russians fail to ratify altogether , what would that mean ?
that 's what is normally referred to as the plan b , which we don ’ t want to think about , but if the kyoto protocol does not enter into force in the very near future , i think the risk of climate fatigue may kick in . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.09.2003 opinion : did iraq really hurt german-american business ties ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard and george shook hands and made up in new york on wednesday .
now that u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have patched things up , what 's going on with their two countries ' economic relations ?
deutsche welle 's rolf wenkel offers his reflections . no matter how unfounded and pointless a war may be , if it is waged by americans , the u.s. population always reacts patriotically .
so it came as no surprise that there was an outcry in the german media in the spring .
since german chancellor schröder and french president chirac did n't want to help bush in iraq , the newsmakers lamented , the americans were sure to boycott our fine european products . imprudent archconservative american senators confirmed their fears and issued the calls for boycotts .
and the german media quickly dug up corresponding stories , from the nosedive in sales of french cheese and red wine in the united states , to renaming " french fries " " freedom fries , " to the bavarian company keim that suddenly lost the privilege to coat the pentagon with its special mineral paints . senator steve latourette , - does n't sound all that american , could it be that his grandfather was french ? - a republican from ohio , convinced congress that german paints were not appropriate for the pentagon during wartime , what with the germans on the wrong side . it was definitely a bitter setback for german-american economic relations , despite the fact that keim paints already bedecked the capitol , the new york stock exchange and arlington house at arlington national cemetery near washington .
the firm had even touched up the pentagon 's western façade after one of the planes flew into it on september 11 . strangely quiet since then the experts and business functionaries who tried to persuade us that chancellor schröder damaged german-american business ties with his policies on iraq have been strangely quiet .
not only since gerhard and george shook hands last week in a new york hotel and promised to get along , no , it was strangely quiet even before that . but the explanation is simple : the pundits ran out of steam . already in february a poll carried out in the united states by the consultancy droege showed that not even 1 percent of german firms had recorded measurable declines in business .
there were no indications at all of problems between germans and americans .

power is being restored in italy following sunday 's massive blackout - the fourth major western power cut in two months .
now many in germany are wondering if it could happen here . following an accident on a power supply line in switzerland , it was only a matter of seconds before grid failure spread , leaving italy in darkness on sunday night .
germany 's energy providers reacted quickly , taking measures to prevent the power outage from affecting the german network . according to johannes altmeppen , spokesman for the country 's third largest energy company , vattenfall europe , extra power pumps were immediately activated to use up excess energy , preventing a power surge beyond the normal network frequency of 50 hertz . germany better prepared so was germany just lucky this time ?
or is the german network superior to those in north america , london and scandinavia , all places which , like italy , have suffered major outages recently ? altmeppen says it is .
" italy did n't exactly come as a surprise , " he told dw-world .
" italy does n't produce enough energy for its needs , so it has to import power , mainly from france and switzerland , and that 's not good .
here in germany , we produce enough energy , we have enough reserves , and we have a wide network so we 're not dependent on one or two main generators . " germany 's energy companies have been reassuring worried consumers ever since the blackout that hit north america in august .
such an extreme power outage ca n't happen here , they say . the german grid is so close-knit , that if there were a power outage , another generator would kick in to fill the gap .
and if multiple facilities were to malfunction , generators in neighboring european countries would provide germany with power . causes still unknown german energy officials still do n't know exactly what caused the blackout in north america - they say that american officials are being cautious in how much information they release in their statements . the cause of the power outages in london and scandinavia have n't been explained yet either , as investigations are still going on .
italian officials disagree over who is to blame for their blackout .
in each case , terrorist activity has been dismissed . terrorist motives ? but konstantin staschus , the director of germany 's association of network operators -lrb- verband der netzbetreiber -rrb- says the question is still being asked : could terrorists succeed in bringing an entire country to a standstill if they were to gain access to the power supply via the internet ? " energy providers are asking themselves that question , not just because of the threat of terrorism , but also because of the threat from internet viruses and worms , " staschus said .
he adds that such a situation in germany is highly unlikely , because the computer networks that direct the energy flow operate independently of the internet . for johannes altmeppen of vattenfall europe , raising the terrorist alarm is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction . " we 're constantly checking the safety and security of our networks , " he said .
" there is absolutely no reason for anyone to worry about this point .

power is being restored in italy following sunday 's massive blackout - the fourth major western power cut in two months .
now many in germany are wondering if it could happen here . following an accident on a power supply line in switzerland , it was only a matter of seconds before grid failure spread , leaving italy in darkness on sunday night .
germany 's energy providers reacted quickly , taking measures to prevent the power outage from affecting the german network . according to johannes altmeppen , spokesman for the country 's third largest energy company , vattenfall europe , extra power pumps were immediately activated to use up excess energy , preventing a power surge beyond the normal network frequency of 50 hertz . germany better prepared so was germany just lucky this time ?
or is the german network superior to those in north america , london and scandinavia , all places which , like italy , have suffered major outages recently ? altmeppen says it is .
" italy did n't exactly come as a surprise , " he told dw-world .
" italy does n't produce enough energy for its needs , so it has to import power , mainly from france and switzerland , and that 's not good .
here in germany , we produce enough energy , we have enough reserves , and we have a wide network so we 're not dependent on one or two main generators . " germany 's energy companies have been reassuring worried consumers ever since the blackout that hit north america in august .
such an extreme power outage ca n't happen here , they say . the german grid is so close-knit , that if there were a power outage , another generator would kick in to fill the gap .
and if multiple facilities were to malfunction , generators in neighboring european countries would provide germany with power . causes still unknown german energy officials still do n't know exactly what caused the blackout in north america - they say that american officials are being cautious in how much information they release in their statements . the cause of the power outages in london and scandinavia have n't been explained yet either , as investigations are still going on .
italian officials disagree over who is to blame for their blackout .
in each case , terrorist activity has been dismissed . terrorist motives ? but konstantin staschus , the director of germany 's association of network operators -lrb- verband der netzbetreiber -rrb- says the question is still being asked : could terrorists succeed in bringing an entire country to a standstill if they were to gain access to the power supply via the internet ? " energy providers are asking themselves that question , not just because of the threat of terrorism , but also because of the threat from internet viruses and worms , " staschus said .
he adds that such a situation in germany is highly unlikely , because the computer networks that direct the energy flow operate independently of the internet . for johannes altmeppen of vattenfall europe , raising the terrorist alarm is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction . " we 're constantly checking the safety and security of our networks , " he said .
" there is absolutely no reason for anyone to worry about this point .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2003 russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions goes up in smoke unless russia ratifies it .
russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .
the unfcc has also chimed in with words of encouragement for the putin government .
" there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that is both economically attractive and at the same time , climate-friendly , " the executive secretary of the u.n. agency , joke-waller hunter , told deutsche welle ahead of putin ’ s announcement on monday .
but despite such urging , putin refuses to get down from the fence and make a decision on ratification .
replying to critics on monday , putin said sarcastically , " people say we are a northern country and a temperature two to three degrees warmer would not be scary , maybe it would be good ...

russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .

deutsche welle 's john hay spoke with joke-waller hunter , executive secretary of the unfccc about how russia could profit from adopting the kyoto protocol and the impact of global warming . here in europe and in the northern hemisphere in general people have seen an extremely hot summer .
it 's been billed as the hottest summer in 2000 years by some .
does this mean that more people now accept the fact that climate change is happening and that it is being caused by human kind ?
the scientists have already predicted in their models that we will have more extreme weather events in the years to come .
we had the floods in 2002 , the heat wave in europe this year - these are the type of extreme weather events that climate scientists are predicting .
so it certainly raises awareness for the issues .
it draws the attention of politicians to the issue .
i do n't think you would find a scientist who would really say that this is all due to the human impact on the climate , but it certainly helps to get it high on the agenda .
but has n't it been a sort of wake-up call ?
have n't people been coming to you now and saying " we 've doubted the science up to now but now it 's quite obvious that climate change is taking place " ?
people do make those remarks and also many politicians are now aware that this is a very serious issue .
the impacts are not only felt in the developing countries , which are the most vulnerable to climate change - given that their food production is under threat if the climate changes - but they also feel in european countries that something is happening to the climate and that it has huge economic impacts as well as impacts on daily life .
now , there are people in russia who actually welcome climate change , since they say that russia , as a cold country , can do with a little more warmth , that it ca n't do any harm if the temperature rises and that it could actually help increase agricultural output .
what do you say to this ?
well , i think the russians are really going through a very elaborate process of cost- benefit analysis , of which agricultural productivity is one element .
others being what it means for energy exports of russia and energy use in russia .
generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .
russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?
well , the kyoto protocol would enter into force 90 days after the russians have ratified it and have made it clear to the united nations in new york .
so , if we count the 90 days , it 's unlikely because they should have made their move in new york before the 13th of september .
it 's unlikely that when we have our conference of the parties in milan in early december that the protocol will have entered into force .
it would be quite important that we know at the time of the milan meeting when it will enter into force .
we are still quite confident that the russians will move at such a pace that at milan we will know when the protocol will come into force .
that would give an enormously positive signal to the conference , to the parties and to the meeting and would really make people even more aware of the need to implement , what they have agreed in an international context .
and if the russians fail to ratify altogether , what would that mean ?
that 's what is normally referred to as the plan b , which we don ’ t want to think about , but if the kyoto protocol does not enter into force in the very near future , i think the risk of climate fatigue may kick in . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

we are still quite confident that the russians will move at such a pace that at milan we will know when the protocol will come into force .
that would give an enormously positive signal to the conference , to the parties and to the meeting and would really make people even more aware of the need to implement , what they have agreed in an international context .
and if the russians fail to ratify altogether , what would that mean ?
that 's what is normally referred to as the plan b , which we don ’ t want to think about , but if the kyoto protocol does not enter into force in the very near future , i think the risk of climate fatigue may kick in . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .
although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex train in berlin but the group denies that it intends to try to compete with deutsche bahn in high-speed traffic .
" we have a regional train concept , with our product interconnex .
we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

the publishing house holtzbrinck has said it will sell the tagesspiegel paper to its former leading manager pierre gerckens .
gerckens , until now a member of the publisher 's supervisory board , made a bid for the newspaper after it became clear that holtzbrinck would have difficulties getting special dispensation from the economics ministry to allow it to merge the tagesspiegel with the berliner zeitung newspaper , which it has sought to buy .
germany 's competition regulator had come out in early september against holtzbrinck buying the berliner verlag , the group of newspaper 's that includes the berliner zeitung , arguing that the publisher would then have an unfair advantage in the berlin newspaper market and hurt competition among regional newspapers .
holtzbrinck has said it will now apply for permission from the competition regulator to buy the berlin newspaper group .
the bauer-verlag publishing house had previously bid € 20 million - more than the undisclosed sum gerckens will pay - for the financially-ailing tagesspiegel .
" we can not get rid of the impression that the ministry and the bidder have been led around by the nose , " bauer responded to the sale . more briefs 26.09.2003 -pipe- enron suit targets deutsche bank 26.09.2003 -pipe- polish mobile company elusive for telekom 26.09.2003 -pipe- social security costs push deficit up 25.09.2003 -pipe- test start for german truck toll system set 25.09.2003 -pipe- new figures raise hopes of german economic upswing 25.09.2003 -pipe- regional train travel to get costlier in germany 25.09.2003 -pipe- siemens lands € 500 million train contract in britain 25.09.2003 -pipe- axel springer eyes russian publishing market radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

power is being restored in italy following sunday 's massive blackout - the fourth major western power cut in two months .
now many in germany are wondering if it could happen here . following an accident on a power supply line in switzerland , it was only a matter of seconds before grid failure spread , leaving italy in darkness on sunday night .
germany 's energy providers reacted quickly , taking measures to prevent the power outage from affecting the german network . according to johannes altmeppen , spokesman for the country 's third largest energy company , vattenfall europe , extra power pumps were immediately activated to use up excess energy , preventing a power surge beyond the normal network frequency of 50 hertz . germany better prepared so was germany just lucky this time ?
or is the german network superior to those in north america , london and scandinavia , all places which , like italy , have suffered major outages recently ? altmeppen says it is .
" italy did n't exactly come as a surprise , " he told dw-world .
" italy does n't produce enough energy for its needs , so it has to import power , mainly from france and switzerland , and that 's not good .
here in germany , we produce enough energy , we have enough reserves , and we have a wide network so we 're not dependent on one or two main generators . " germany 's energy companies have been reassuring worried consumers ever since the blackout that hit north america in august .
such an extreme power outage ca n't happen here , they say . the german grid is so close-knit , that if there were a power outage , another generator would kick in to fill the gap .
and if multiple facilities were to malfunction , generators in neighboring european countries would provide germany with power . causes still unknown german energy officials still do n't know exactly what caused the blackout in north america - they say that american officials are being cautious in how much information they release in their statements . the cause of the power outages in london and scandinavia have n't been explained yet either , as investigations are still going on .
italian officials disagree over who is to blame for their blackout .
in each case , terrorist activity has been dismissed . terrorist motives ? but konstantin staschus , the director of germany 's association of network operators -lrb- verband der netzbetreiber -rrb- says the question is still being asked : could terrorists succeed in bringing an entire country to a standstill if they were to gain access to the power supply via the internet ? " energy providers are asking themselves that question , not just because of the threat of terrorism , but also because of the threat from internet viruses and worms , " staschus said .
he adds that such a situation in germany is highly unlikely , because the computer networks that direct the energy flow operate independently of the internet . for johannes altmeppen of vattenfall europe , raising the terrorist alarm is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction . " we 're constantly checking the safety and security of our networks , " he said .

germany 's energy providers reacted quickly , taking measures to prevent the power outage from affecting the german network . according to johannes altmeppen , spokesman for the country 's third largest energy company , vattenfall europe , extra power pumps were immediately activated to use up excess energy , preventing a power surge beyond the normal network frequency of 50 hertz . germany better prepared so was germany just lucky this time ?
or is the german network superior to those in north america , london and scandinavia , all places which , like italy , have suffered major outages recently ? altmeppen says it is .
" italy did n't exactly come as a surprise , " he told dw-world .
" italy does n't produce enough energy for its needs , so it has to import power , mainly from france and switzerland , and that 's not good .
here in germany , we produce enough energy , we have enough reserves , and we have a wide network so we 're not dependent on one or two main generators . " germany 's energy companies have been reassuring worried consumers ever since the blackout that hit north america in august .
such an extreme power outage ca n't happen here , they say . the german grid is so close-knit , that if there were a power outage , another generator would kick in to fill the gap .
and if multiple facilities were to malfunction , generators in neighboring european countries would provide germany with power . causes still unknown german energy officials still do n't know exactly what caused the blackout in north america - they say that american officials are being cautious in how much information they release in their statements . the cause of the power outages in london and scandinavia have n't been explained yet either , as investigations are still going on .
italian officials disagree over who is to blame for their blackout .
in each case , terrorist activity has been dismissed . terrorist motives ? but konstantin staschus , the director of germany 's association of network operators -lrb- verband der netzbetreiber -rrb- says the question is still being asked : could terrorists succeed in bringing an entire country to a standstill if they were to gain access to the power supply via the internet ? " energy providers are asking themselves that question , not just because of the threat of terrorism , but also because of the threat from internet viruses and worms , " staschus said .
he adds that such a situation in germany is highly unlikely , because the computer networks that direct the energy flow operate independently of the internet . for johannes altmeppen of vattenfall europe , raising the terrorist alarm is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction . " we 're constantly checking the safety and security of our networks , " he said .
" there is absolutely no reason for anyone to worry about this point .
our security systems are arranged so that it is impossible for anyone to break into them via the internet or with an internet worm .

by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country .

russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .
the unfcc has also chimed in with words of encouragement for the putin government .
" there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that is both economically attractive and at the same time , climate-friendly , " the executive secretary of the u.n. agency , joke-waller hunter , told deutsche welle ahead of putin ’ s announcement on monday .
but despite such urging , putin refuses to get down from the fence and make a decision on ratification .
replying to critics on monday , putin said sarcastically , " people say we are a northern country and a temperature two to three degrees warmer would not be scary , maybe it would be good ...

russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .

deutsche welle 's john hay spoke with joke-waller hunter , executive secretary of the unfccc about how russia could profit from adopting the kyoto protocol and the impact of global warming . here in europe and in the northern hemisphere in general people have seen an extremely hot summer .
it 's been billed as the hottest summer in 2000 years by some .
does this mean that more people now accept the fact that climate change is happening and that it is being caused by human kind ?
the scientists have already predicted in their models that we will have more extreme weather events in the years to come .
we had the floods in 2002 , the heat wave in europe this year - these are the type of extreme weather events that climate scientists are predicting .
so it certainly raises awareness for the issues .
it draws the attention of politicians to the issue .
i do n't think you would find a scientist who would really say that this is all due to the human impact on the climate , but it certainly helps to get it high on the agenda .
but has n't it been a sort of wake-up call ?
have n't people been coming to you now and saying " we 've doubted the science up to now but now it 's quite obvious that climate change is taking place " ?
people do make those remarks and also many politicians are now aware that this is a very serious issue .
the impacts are not only felt in the developing countries , which are the most vulnerable to climate change - given that their food production is under threat if the climate changes - but they also feel in european countries that something is happening to the climate and that it has huge economic impacts as well as impacts on daily life .
now , there are people in russia who actually welcome climate change , since they say that russia , as a cold country , can do with a little more warmth , that it ca n't do any harm if the temperature rises and that it could actually help increase agricultural output .
what do you say to this ?
well , i think the russians are really going through a very elaborate process of cost- benefit analysis , of which agricultural productivity is one element .
others being what it means for energy exports of russia and energy use in russia .
generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .
russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?
well , the kyoto protocol would enter into force 90 days after the russians have ratified it and have made it clear to the united nations in new york .
so , if we count the 90 days , it 's unlikely because they should have made their move in new york before the 13th of september .
it 's unlikely that when we have our conference of the parties in milan in early december that the protocol will have entered into force .
it would be quite important that we know at the time of the milan meeting when it will enter into force .
we are still quite confident that the russians will move at such a pace that at milan we will know when the protocol will come into force .
that would give an enormously positive signal to the conference , to the parties and to the meeting and would really make people even more aware of the need to implement , what they have agreed in an international context .
and if the russians fail to ratify altogether , what would that mean ?
that 's what is normally referred to as the plan b , which we don ’ t want to think about , but if the kyoto protocol does not enter into force in the very near future , i think the risk of climate fatigue may kick in . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?
well , the kyoto protocol would enter into force 90 days after the russians have ratified it and have made it clear to the united nations in new york .
so , if we count the 90 days , it 's unlikely because they should have made their move in new york before the 13th of september .
it 's unlikely that when we have our conference of the parties in milan in early december that the protocol will have entered into force .
it would be quite important that we know at the time of the milan meeting when it will enter into force .
we are still quite confident that the russians will move at such a pace that at milan we will know when the protocol will come into force .
that would give an enormously positive signal to the conference , to the parties and to the meeting and would really make people even more aware of the need to implement , what they have agreed in an international context .
and if the russians fail to ratify altogether , what would that mean ?
that 's what is normally referred to as the plan b , which we don ’ t want to think about , but if the kyoto protocol does not enter into force in the very near future , i think the risk of climate fatigue may kick in . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 29.09.2003 blackout - could it happen in germany ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite a wave of blackouts in europe , germany says its power grid is stabile .
power is being restored in italy following sunday 's massive blackout - the fourth major western power cut in two months .
now many in germany are wondering if it could happen here . following an accident on a power supply line in switzerland , it was only a matter of seconds before grid failure spread , leaving italy in darkness on sunday night .
germany 's energy providers reacted quickly , taking measures to prevent the power outage from affecting the german network . according to johannes altmeppen , spokesman for the country 's third largest energy company , vattenfall europe , extra power pumps were immediately activated to use up excess energy , preventing a power surge beyond the normal network frequency of 50 hertz . germany better prepared so was germany just lucky this time ?
or is the german network superior to those in north america , london and scandinavia , all places which , like italy , have suffered major outages recently ? altmeppen says it is .
" italy did n't exactly come as a surprise , " he told dw-world .
" italy does n't produce enough energy for its needs , so it has to import power , mainly from france and switzerland , and that 's not good .
here in germany , we produce enough energy , we have enough reserves , and we have a wide network so we 're not dependent on one or two main generators . " germany 's energy companies have been reassuring worried consumers ever since the blackout that hit north america in august .
such an extreme power outage ca n't happen here , they say . the german grid is so close-knit , that if there were a power outage , another generator would kick in to fill the gap .
and if multiple facilities were to malfunction , generators in neighboring european countries would provide germany with power . causes still unknown german energy officials still do n't know exactly what caused the blackout in north america - they say that american officials are being cautious in how much information they release in their statements . the cause of the power outages in london and scandinavia have n't been explained yet either , as investigations are still going on .
italian officials disagree over who is to blame for their blackout .
in each case , terrorist activity has been dismissed . terrorist motives ? but konstantin staschus , the director of germany 's association of network operators -lrb- verband der netzbetreiber -rrb- says the question is still being asked : could terrorists succeed in bringing an entire country to a standstill if they were to gain access to the power supply via the internet ? " energy providers are asking themselves that question , not just because of the threat of terrorism , but also because of the threat from internet viruses and worms , " staschus said .
he adds that such a situation in germany is highly unlikely , because the computer networks that direct the energy flow operate independently of the internet . for johannes altmeppen of vattenfall europe , raising the terrorist alarm is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction . " we 're constantly checking the safety and security of our networks , " he said .
" there is absolutely no reason for anyone to worry about this point .
our security systems are arranged so that it is impossible for anyone to break into them via the internet or with an internet worm . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy recovers from worst blackout in a decade most of italy lost power sunday morning in the latest european blackout , leaving thousands stranded and city streets dark .
by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country .
-lrb- sept.28 , 2003 -rrb- complete blackout unlikely in germany crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function .
-lrb- aug.16 , 2003 -rrb- what will power germany in the future ?
as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary .

deutsche welle 's john hay spoke with joke-waller hunter , executive secretary of the unfccc about how russia could profit from adopting the kyoto protocol and the impact of global warming . here in europe and in the northern hemisphere in general people have seen an extremely hot summer .
it 's been billed as the hottest summer in 2000 years by some .
does this mean that more people now accept the fact that climate change is happening and that it is being caused by human kind ?
the scientists have already predicted in their models that we will have more extreme weather events in the years to come .
we had the floods in 2002 , the heat wave in europe this year - these are the type of extreme weather events that climate scientists are predicting .
so it certainly raises awareness for the issues .
it draws the attention of politicians to the issue .
i do n't think you would find a scientist who would really say that this is all due to the human impact on the climate , but it certainly helps to get it high on the agenda .
but has n't it been a sort of wake-up call ?
have n't people been coming to you now and saying " we 've doubted the science up to now but now it 's quite obvious that climate change is taking place " ?
people do make those remarks and also many politicians are now aware that this is a very serious issue .
the impacts are not only felt in the developing countries , which are the most vulnerable to climate change - given that their food production is under threat if the climate changes - but they also feel in european countries that something is happening to the climate and that it has huge economic impacts as well as impacts on daily life .
now , there are people in russia who actually welcome climate change , since they say that russia , as a cold country , can do with a little more warmth , that it ca n't do any harm if the temperature rises and that it could actually help increase agricultural output .
what do you say to this ?
well , i think the russians are really going through a very elaborate process of cost- benefit analysis , of which agricultural productivity is one element .
others being what it means for energy exports of russia and energy use in russia .
generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2003 kyoto protocol helps russia modernize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol gives russia the incentive to modernize its energy market .
deutsche welle 's john hay spoke with joke-waller hunter , executive secretary of the unfccc about how russia could profit from adopting the kyoto protocol and the impact of global warming . here in europe and in the northern hemisphere in general people have seen an extremely hot summer .
it 's been billed as the hottest summer in 2000 years by some .
does this mean that more people now accept the fact that climate change is happening and that it is being caused by human kind ?
the scientists have already predicted in their models that we will have more extreme weather events in the years to come .
we had the floods in 2002 , the heat wave in europe this year - these are the type of extreme weather events that climate scientists are predicting .
so it certainly raises awareness for the issues .
it draws the attention of politicians to the issue .
i do n't think you would find a scientist who would really say that this is all due to the human impact on the climate , but it certainly helps to get it high on the agenda .
but has n't it been a sort of wake-up call ?
have n't people been coming to you now and saying " we 've doubted the science up to now but now it 's quite obvious that climate change is taking place " ?
people do make those remarks and also many politicians are now aware that this is a very serious issue .
the impacts are not only felt in the developing countries , which are the most vulnerable to climate change - given that their food production is under threat if the climate changes - but they also feel in european countries that something is happening to the climate and that it has huge economic impacts as well as impacts on daily life .
now , there are people in russia who actually welcome climate change , since they say that russia , as a cold country , can do with a little more warmth , that it ca n't do any harm if the temperature rises and that it could actually help increase agricultural output .
what do you say to this ?
well , i think the russians are really going through a very elaborate process of cost- benefit analysis , of which agricultural productivity is one element .
others being what it means for energy exports of russia and energy use in russia .
generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .
russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?
well , the kyoto protocol would enter into force 90 days after the russians have ratified it and have made it clear to the united nations in new york .
so , if we count the 90 days , it 's unlikely because they should have made their move in new york before the 13th of september .
it 's unlikely that when we have our conference of the parties in milan in early december that the protocol will have entered into force .
it would be quite important that we know at the time of the milan meeting when it will enter into force .
we are still quite confident that the russians will move at such a pace that at milan we will know when the protocol will come into force .
that would give an enormously positive signal to the conference , to the parties and to the meeting and would really make people even more aware of the need to implement , what they have agreed in an international context .
and if the russians fail to ratify altogether , what would that mean ?
that 's what is normally referred to as the plan b , which we don ’ t want to think about , but if the kyoto protocol does not enter into force in the very near future , i think the risk of climate fatigue may kick in . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.09.2003 connex 's german presence expands with sylt route großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in 2005 , beach lovers can take connex trains to sylt as the deutsche bahn struggles with negative headlines , french-owned connex muscles in on as much of the german rail giant 's turf as possible . a pricing system fiasco , further job cuts , compeititon from low-cost airlines , delayed trains , empty compartments and yet more red ink – these are the sorts of headlines deutsche bahn has been making lately .
increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .
although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex train in berlin but the group denies that it intends to try to compete with deutsche bahn in high-speed traffic .
" we have a regional train concept , with our product interconnex .
we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .
although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex train in berlin but the group denies that it intends to try to compete with deutsche bahn in high-speed traffic .
" we have a regional train concept , with our product interconnex .
we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .

power is being restored in italy following sunday 's massive blackout - the fourth major western power cut in two months .
now many in germany are wondering if it could happen here . following an accident on a power supply line in switzerland , it was only a matter of seconds before grid failure spread , leaving italy in darkness on sunday night .
germany 's energy providers reacted quickly , taking measures to prevent the power outage from affecting the german network . according to johannes altmeppen , spokesman for the country 's third largest energy company , vattenfall europe , extra power pumps were immediately activated to use up excess energy , preventing a power surge beyond the normal network frequency of 50 hertz . germany better prepared so was germany just lucky this time ?

" italy does n't produce enough energy for its needs , so it has to import power , mainly from france and switzerland , and that 's not good .
here in germany , we produce enough energy , we have enough reserves , and we have a wide network so we 're not dependent on one or two main generators . " germany 's energy companies have been reassuring worried consumers ever since the blackout that hit north america in august .

" energy providers are asking themselves that question , not just because of the threat of terrorism , but also because of the threat from internet viruses and worms , " staschus said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2003 russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions goes up in smoke unless russia ratifies it .
russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .
the unfcc has also chimed in with words of encouragement for the putin government .
" there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that is both economically attractive and at the same time , climate-friendly , " the executive secretary of the u.n. agency , joke-waller hunter , told deutsche welle ahead of putin ’ s announcement on monday .
but despite such urging , putin refuses to get down from the fence and make a decision on ratification .
replying to critics on monday , putin said sarcastically , " people say we are a northern country and a temperature two to three degrees warmer would not be scary , maybe it would be good ...
we would have to spend less money on fur coats and other warm clothes .

eu parliament approves emissions trading the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year -lrb- july 3 , 2003 -rrb- .

power is being restored in italy following sunday 's massive blackout - the fourth major western power cut in two months .
now many in germany are wondering if it could happen here . following an accident on a power supply line in switzerland , it was only a matter of seconds before grid failure spread , leaving italy in darkness on sunday night .
germany 's energy providers reacted quickly , taking measures to prevent the power outage from affecting the german network . according to johannes altmeppen , spokesman for the country 's third largest energy company , vattenfall europe , extra power pumps were immediately activated to use up excess energy , preventing a power surge beyond the normal network frequency of 50 hertz . germany better prepared so was germany just lucky this time ?
or is the german network superior to those in north america , london and scandinavia , all places which , like italy , have suffered major outages recently ? altmeppen says it is .
" italy did n't exactly come as a surprise , " he told dw-world .
" italy does n't produce enough energy for its needs , so it has to import power , mainly from france and switzerland , and that 's not good .
here in germany , we produce enough energy , we have enough reserves , and we have a wide network so we 're not dependent on one or two main generators . " germany 's energy companies have been reassuring worried consumers ever since the blackout that hit north america in august .
such an extreme power outage ca n't happen here , they say . the german grid is so close-knit , that if there were a power outage , another generator would kick in to fill the gap .
and if multiple facilities were to malfunction , generators in neighboring european countries would provide germany with power . causes still unknown german energy officials still do n't know exactly what caused the blackout in north america - they say that american officials are being cautious in how much information they release in their statements . the cause of the power outages in london and scandinavia have n't been explained yet either , as investigations are still going on .
italian officials disagree over who is to blame for their blackout .
in each case , terrorist activity has been dismissed . terrorist motives ? but konstantin staschus , the director of germany 's association of network operators -lrb- verband der netzbetreiber -rrb- says the question is still being asked : could terrorists succeed in bringing an entire country to a standstill if they were to gain access to the power supply via the internet ? " energy providers are asking themselves that question , not just because of the threat of terrorism , but also because of the threat from internet viruses and worms , " staschus said .
he adds that such a situation in germany is highly unlikely , because the computer networks that direct the energy flow operate independently of the internet . for johannes altmeppen of vattenfall europe , raising the terrorist alarm is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction . " we 're constantly checking the safety and security of our networks , " he said .
" there is absolutely no reason for anyone to worry about this point .
our security systems are arranged so that it is impossible for anyone to break into them via the internet or with an internet worm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2003 russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions goes up in smoke unless russia ratifies it .
russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .
the unfcc has also chimed in with words of encouragement for the putin government .
" there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that is both economically attractive and at the same time , climate-friendly , " the executive secretary of the u.n. agency , joke-waller hunter , told deutsche welle ahead of putin ’ s announcement on monday .
but despite such urging , putin refuses to get down from the fence and make a decision on ratification .
replying to critics on monday , putin said sarcastically , " people say we are a northern country and a temperature two to three degrees warmer would not be scary , maybe it would be good ...
we would have to spend less money on fur coats and other warm clothes .

deutsche welle 's john hay spoke with joke-waller hunter , executive secretary of the unfccc about how russia could profit from adopting the kyoto protocol and the impact of global warming . here in europe and in the northern hemisphere in general people have seen an extremely hot summer .
it 's been billed as the hottest summer in 2000 years by some .
does this mean that more people now accept the fact that climate change is happening and that it is being caused by human kind ?
the scientists have already predicted in their models that we will have more extreme weather events in the years to come .
we had the floods in 2002 , the heat wave in europe this year - these are the type of extreme weather events that climate scientists are predicting .
so it certainly raises awareness for the issues .
it draws the attention of politicians to the issue .
i do n't think you would find a scientist who would really say that this is all due to the human impact on the climate , but it certainly helps to get it high on the agenda .
but has n't it been a sort of wake-up call ?
have n't people been coming to you now and saying " we 've doubted the science up to now but now it 's quite obvious that climate change is taking place " ?
people do make those remarks and also many politicians are now aware that this is a very serious issue .
the impacts are not only felt in the developing countries , which are the most vulnerable to climate change - given that their food production is under threat if the climate changes - but they also feel in european countries that something is happening to the climate and that it has huge economic impacts as well as impacts on daily life .
now , there are people in russia who actually welcome climate change , since they say that russia , as a cold country , can do with a little more warmth , that it ca n't do any harm if the temperature rises and that it could actually help increase agricultural output .
what do you say to this ?
well , i think the russians are really going through a very elaborate process of cost- benefit analysis , of which agricultural productivity is one element .
others being what it means for energy exports of russia and energy use in russia .
generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .
russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?
well , the kyoto protocol would enter into force 90 days after the russians have ratified it and have made it clear to the united nations in new york .
so , if we count the 90 days , it 's unlikely because they should have made their move in new york before the 13th of september .
it 's unlikely that when we have our conference of the parties in milan in early december that the protocol will have entered into force .
it would be quite important that we know at the time of the milan meeting when it will enter into force .
we are still quite confident that the russians will move at such a pace that at milan we will know when the protocol will come into force .
that would give an enormously positive signal to the conference , to the parties and to the meeting and would really make people even more aware of the need to implement , what they have agreed in an international context .
and if the russians fail to ratify altogether , what would that mean ?
that 's what is normally referred to as the plan b , which we don ’ t want to think about , but if the kyoto protocol does not enter into force in the very near future , i think the risk of climate fatigue may kick in . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .
russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?
well , the kyoto protocol would enter into force 90 days after the russians have ratified it and have made it clear to the united nations in new york .
so , if we count the 90 days , it 's unlikely because they should have made their move in new york before the 13th of september .
it 's unlikely that when we have our conference of the parties in milan in early december that the protocol will have entered into force .
it would be quite important that we know at the time of the milan meeting when it will enter into force .
we are still quite confident that the russians will move at such a pace that at milan we will know when the protocol will come into force .
that would give an enormously positive signal to the conference , to the parties and to the meeting and would really make people even more aware of the need to implement , what they have agreed in an international context .
and if the russians fail to ratify altogether , what would that mean ?
that 's what is normally referred to as the plan b , which we don ’ t want to think about , but if the kyoto protocol does not enter into force in the very near future , i think the risk of climate fatigue may kick in . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .
although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex train in berlin but the group denies that it intends to try to compete with deutsche bahn in high-speed traffic .
" we have a regional train concept , with our product interconnex .
we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 29.09.2003 opinion : did iraq really hurt german-american business ties ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard and george shook hands and made up in new york on wednesday .
now that u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have patched things up , what 's going on with their two countries ' economic relations ?
deutsche welle 's rolf wenkel offers his reflections . no matter how unfounded and pointless a war may be , if it is waged by americans , the u.s. population always reacts patriotically .
so it came as no surprise that there was an outcry in the german media in the spring .
since german chancellor schröder and french president chirac did n't want to help bush in iraq , the newsmakers lamented , the americans were sure to boycott our fine european products . imprudent archconservative american senators confirmed their fears and issued the calls for boycotts .
and the german media quickly dug up corresponding stories , from the nosedive in sales of french cheese and red wine in the united states , to renaming " french fries " " freedom fries , " to the bavarian company keim that suddenly lost the privilege to coat the pentagon with its special mineral paints . senator steve latourette , - does n't sound all that american , could it be that his grandfather was french ? - a republican from ohio , convinced congress that german paints were not appropriate for the pentagon during wartime , what with the germans on the wrong side . it was definitely a bitter setback for german-american economic relations , despite the fact that keim paints already bedecked the capitol , the new york stock exchange and arlington house at arlington national cemetery near washington .
the firm had even touched up the pentagon 's western façade after one of the planes flew into it on september 11 . strangely quiet since then the experts and business functionaries who tried to persuade us that chancellor schröder damaged german-american business ties with his policies on iraq have been strangely quiet .
not only since gerhard and george shook hands last week in a new york hotel and promised to get along , no , it was strangely quiet even before that . but the explanation is simple : the pundits ran out of steam . already in february a poll carried out in the united states by the consultancy droege showed that not even 1 percent of german firms had recorded measurable declines in business .
there were no indications at all of problems between germans and americans .
on the contrary , the revival of the u.s. economy led to an increase in opportunities for german companies . on the other side of the atlantic , the economic development corporation of north rhine-westphalia revealed that 560 american companies were located in that western german state alone .
their yearly turnover is € 53 billion , and they employ 170,000 people .
on top of that , 39 percent of the companies plan to invest in germany over the next three years . fish stories the clamor about damaged german-american business ties was actually just a crock . but we should have known that from the start .
it 's obvious when you come across news like wednesday 's announcement that munich-based siemens had sealed a $ 200 million deal for its air conditioning , ventilation , fire safety and security systems .
the contractor is the u.s. army ; the parts will be installed in governmental and administrative buildings . besides that , keim from bavaria has been contracted to paint again .
this time , however , it wo n't do the pentagon - the bavarian company lost that contract .
instead , keim will paint the white house . rolf wenkel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de after meeting with bush , schröder urges " strengthened " u.n. role in iraq following their first meeting in 16 months , german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush said they were ready to work together to make iraq safer .
-lrb- sept .
24 , 2003 -rrb- schröder hopes to mend ties with bush a collection of recent deutsche welle stories on german-american relations .

power is being restored in italy following sunday 's massive blackout - the fourth major western power cut in two months .
now many in germany are wondering if it could happen here . following an accident on a power supply line in switzerland , it was only a matter of seconds before grid failure spread , leaving italy in darkness on sunday night .
germany 's energy providers reacted quickly , taking measures to prevent the power outage from affecting the german network . according to johannes altmeppen , spokesman for the country 's third largest energy company , vattenfall europe , extra power pumps were immediately activated to use up excess energy , preventing a power surge beyond the normal network frequency of 50 hertz . germany better prepared so was germany just lucky this time ?
or is the german network superior to those in north america , london and scandinavia , all places which , like italy , have suffered major outages recently ? altmeppen says it is .
" italy did n't exactly come as a surprise , " he told dw-world .
" italy does n't produce enough energy for its needs , so it has to import power , mainly from france and switzerland , and that 's not good .
here in germany , we produce enough energy , we have enough reserves , and we have a wide network so we 're not dependent on one or two main generators . " germany 's energy companies have been reassuring worried consumers ever since the blackout that hit north america in august .
such an extreme power outage ca n't happen here , they say . the german grid is so close-knit , that if there were a power outage , another generator would kick in to fill the gap .
and if multiple facilities were to malfunction , generators in neighboring european countries would provide germany with power . causes still unknown german energy officials still do n't know exactly what caused the blackout in north america - they say that american officials are being cautious in how much information they release in their statements . the cause of the power outages in london and scandinavia have n't been explained yet either , as investigations are still going on .
italian officials disagree over who is to blame for their blackout .
in each case , terrorist activity has been dismissed . terrorist motives ? but konstantin staschus , the director of germany 's association of network operators -lrb- verband der netzbetreiber -rrb- says the question is still being asked : could terrorists succeed in bringing an entire country to a standstill if they were to gain access to the power supply via the internet ? " energy providers are asking themselves that question , not just because of the threat of terrorism , but also because of the threat from internet viruses and worms , " staschus said .
he adds that such a situation in germany is highly unlikely , because the computer networks that direct the energy flow operate independently of the internet . for johannes altmeppen of vattenfall europe , raising the terrorist alarm is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction . " we 're constantly checking the safety and security of our networks , " he said .
" there is absolutely no reason for anyone to worry about this point .
our security systems are arranged so that it is impossible for anyone to break into them via the internet or with an internet worm .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2003 russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions goes up in smoke unless russia ratifies it .
russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .
the unfcc has also chimed in with words of encouragement for the putin government .
" there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that is both economically attractive and at the same time , climate-friendly , " the executive secretary of the u.n. agency , joke-waller hunter , told deutsche welle ahead of putin ’ s announcement on monday .
but despite such urging , putin refuses to get down from the fence and make a decision on ratification .
replying to critics on monday , putin said sarcastically , " people say we are a northern country and a temperature two to three degrees warmer would not be scary , maybe it would be good ...
we would have to spend less money on fur coats and other warm clothes .

eu parliament approves emissions trading the eu has created the world 's largest emissions trading market which allow firms to buy and sell “ greenhouse ” gases .
economists say it could create a market worth 8 billion euros a year -lrb- july 3 , 2003 -rrb- .

increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .
although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex train in berlin but the group denies that it intends to try to compete with deutsche bahn in high-speed traffic .
" we have a regional train concept , with our product interconnex .
we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.09.2003 connex 's german presence expands with sylt route großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in 2005 , beach lovers can take connex trains to sylt as the deutsche bahn struggles with negative headlines , french-owned connex muscles in on as much of the german rail giant 's turf as possible . a pricing system fiasco , further job cuts , compeititon from low-cost airlines , delayed trains , empty compartments and yet more red ink – these are the sorts of headlines deutsche bahn has been making lately .
increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .
although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex train in berlin but the group denies that it intends to try to compete with deutsche bahn in high-speed traffic .
" we have a regional train concept , with our product interconnex .
we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2003 kyoto protocol helps russia modernize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol gives russia the incentive to modernize its energy market .
deutsche welle 's john hay spoke with joke-waller hunter , executive secretary of the unfccc about how russia could profit from adopting the kyoto protocol and the impact of global warming . here in europe and in the northern hemisphere in general people have seen an extremely hot summer .
it 's been billed as the hottest summer in 2000 years by some .
does this mean that more people now accept the fact that climate change is happening and that it is being caused by human kind ?
the scientists have already predicted in their models that we will have more extreme weather events in the years to come .
we had the floods in 2002 , the heat wave in europe this year - these are the type of extreme weather events that climate scientists are predicting .
so it certainly raises awareness for the issues .
it draws the attention of politicians to the issue .
i do n't think you would find a scientist who would really say that this is all due to the human impact on the climate , but it certainly helps to get it high on the agenda .
but has n't it been a sort of wake-up call ?
have n't people been coming to you now and saying " we 've doubted the science up to now but now it 's quite obvious that climate change is taking place " ?
people do make those remarks and also many politicians are now aware that this is a very serious issue .
the impacts are not only felt in the developing countries , which are the most vulnerable to climate change - given that their food production is under threat if the climate changes - but they also feel in european countries that something is happening to the climate and that it has huge economic impacts as well as impacts on daily life .
now , there are people in russia who actually welcome climate change , since they say that russia , as a cold country , can do with a little more warmth , that it ca n't do any harm if the temperature rises and that it could actually help increase agricultural output .
what do you say to this ?
well , i think the russians are really going through a very elaborate process of cost- benefit analysis , of which agricultural productivity is one element .
others being what it means for energy exports of russia and energy use in russia .
generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .
russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?

deutsche welle 's john hay spoke with joke-waller hunter , executive secretary of the unfccc about how russia could profit from adopting the kyoto protocol and the impact of global warming . here in europe and in the northern hemisphere in general people have seen an extremely hot summer .
it 's been billed as the hottest summer in 2000 years by some .
does this mean that more people now accept the fact that climate change is happening and that it is being caused by human kind ?
the scientists have already predicted in their models that we will have more extreme weather events in the years to come .
we had the floods in 2002 , the heat wave in europe this year - these are the type of extreme weather events that climate scientists are predicting .
so it certainly raises awareness for the issues .
it draws the attention of politicians to the issue .
i do n't think you would find a scientist who would really say that this is all due to the human impact on the climate , but it certainly helps to get it high on the agenda .
but has n't it been a sort of wake-up call ?
have n't people been coming to you now and saying " we 've doubted the science up to now but now it 's quite obvious that climate change is taking place " ?
people do make those remarks and also many politicians are now aware that this is a very serious issue .
the impacts are not only felt in the developing countries , which are the most vulnerable to climate change - given that their food production is under threat if the climate changes - but they also feel in european countries that something is happening to the climate and that it has huge economic impacts as well as impacts on daily life .
now , there are people in russia who actually welcome climate change , since they say that russia , as a cold country , can do with a little more warmth , that it ca n't do any harm if the temperature rises and that it could actually help increase agricultural output .
what do you say to this ?
well , i think the russians are really going through a very elaborate process of cost- benefit analysis , of which agricultural productivity is one element .
others being what it means for energy exports of russia and energy use in russia .
generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .
russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?
well , the kyoto protocol would enter into force 90 days after the russians have ratified it and have made it clear to the united nations in new york .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2003 russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions goes up in smoke unless russia ratifies it .
russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .
the unfcc has also chimed in with words of encouragement for the putin government .
" there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that is both economically attractive and at the same time , climate-friendly , " the executive secretary of the u.n. agency , joke-waller hunter , told deutsche welle ahead of putin ’ s announcement on monday .
but despite such urging , putin refuses to get down from the fence and make a decision on ratification .
replying to critics on monday , putin said sarcastically , " people say we are a northern country and a temperature two to three degrees warmer would not be scary , maybe it would be good ...
we would have to spend less money on fur coats and other warm clothes .

russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .
the unfcc has also chimed in with words of encouragement for the putin government .
" there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that is both economically attractive and at the same time , climate-friendly , " the executive secretary of the u.n. agency , joke-waller hunter , told deutsche welle ahead of putin ’ s announcement on monday .
but despite such urging , putin refuses to get down from the fence and make a decision on ratification .
replying to critics on monday , putin said sarcastically , " people say we are a northern country and a temperature two to three degrees warmer would not be scary , maybe it would be good ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2003 russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions goes up in smoke unless russia ratifies it .
russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .
the unfcc has also chimed in with words of encouragement for the putin government .
" there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that is both economically attractive and at the same time , climate-friendly , " the executive secretary of the u.n. agency , joke-waller hunter , told deutsche welle ahead of putin ’ s announcement on monday .
but despite such urging , putin refuses to get down from the fence and make a decision on ratification .
replying to critics on monday , putin said sarcastically , " people say we are a northern country and a temperature two to three degrees warmer would not be scary , maybe it would be good ...
we would have to spend less money on fur coats and other warm clothes .

power is being restored in italy following sunday 's massive blackout - the fourth major western power cut in two months .
now many in germany are wondering if it could happen here . following an accident on a power supply line in switzerland , it was only a matter of seconds before grid failure spread , leaving italy in darkness on sunday night .
germany 's energy providers reacted quickly , taking measures to prevent the power outage from affecting the german network . according to johannes altmeppen , spokesman for the country 's third largest energy company , vattenfall europe , extra power pumps were immediately activated to use up excess energy , preventing a power surge beyond the normal network frequency of 50 hertz . germany better prepared so was germany just lucky this time ?
or is the german network superior to those in north america , london and scandinavia , all places which , like italy , have suffered major outages recently ? altmeppen says it is .
" italy did n't exactly come as a surprise , " he told dw-world .
" italy does n't produce enough energy for its needs , so it has to import power , mainly from france and switzerland , and that 's not good .
here in germany , we produce enough energy , we have enough reserves , and we have a wide network so we 're not dependent on one or two main generators . " germany 's energy companies have been reassuring worried consumers ever since the blackout that hit north america in august .
such an extreme power outage ca n't happen here , they say . the german grid is so close-knit , that if there were a power outage , another generator would kick in to fill the gap .
and if multiple facilities were to malfunction , generators in neighboring european countries would provide germany with power . causes still unknown german energy officials still do n't know exactly what caused the blackout in north america - they say that american officials are being cautious in how much information they release in their statements . the cause of the power outages in london and scandinavia have n't been explained yet either , as investigations are still going on .
italian officials disagree over who is to blame for their blackout .
in each case , terrorist activity has been dismissed . terrorist motives ? but konstantin staschus , the director of germany 's association of network operators -lrb- verband der netzbetreiber -rrb- says the question is still being asked : could terrorists succeed in bringing an entire country to a standstill if they were to gain access to the power supply via the internet ? " energy providers are asking themselves that question , not just because of the threat of terrorism , but also because of the threat from internet viruses and worms , " staschus said .
he adds that such a situation in germany is highly unlikely , because the computer networks that direct the energy flow operate independently of the internet . for johannes altmeppen of vattenfall europe , raising the terrorist alarm is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction .

power is being restored in italy following sunday 's massive blackout - the fourth major western power cut in two months .
now many in germany are wondering if it could happen here . following an accident on a power supply line in switzerland , it was only a matter of seconds before grid failure spread , leaving italy in darkness on sunday night .
germany 's energy providers reacted quickly , taking measures to prevent the power outage from affecting the german network . according to johannes altmeppen , spokesman for the country 's third largest energy company , vattenfall europe , extra power pumps were immediately activated to use up excess energy , preventing a power surge beyond the normal network frequency of 50 hertz . germany better prepared so was germany just lucky this time ?
or is the german network superior to those in north america , london and scandinavia , all places which , like italy , have suffered major outages recently ? altmeppen says it is .
" italy did n't exactly come as a surprise , " he told dw-world .
" italy does n't produce enough energy for its needs , so it has to import power , mainly from france and switzerland , and that 's not good .
here in germany , we produce enough energy , we have enough reserves , and we have a wide network so we 're not dependent on one or two main generators . " germany 's energy companies have been reassuring worried consumers ever since the blackout that hit north america in august .
such an extreme power outage ca n't happen here , they say . the german grid is so close-knit , that if there were a power outage , another generator would kick in to fill the gap .
and if multiple facilities were to malfunction , generators in neighboring european countries would provide germany with power . causes still unknown german energy officials still do n't know exactly what caused the blackout in north america - they say that american officials are being cautious in how much information they release in their statements . the cause of the power outages in london and scandinavia have n't been explained yet either , as investigations are still going on .
italian officials disagree over who is to blame for their blackout .
in each case , terrorist activity has been dismissed . terrorist motives ? but konstantin staschus , the director of germany 's association of network operators -lrb- verband der netzbetreiber -rrb- says the question is still being asked : could terrorists succeed in bringing an entire country to a standstill if they were to gain access to the power supply via the internet ? " energy providers are asking themselves that question , not just because of the threat of terrorism , but also because of the threat from internet viruses and worms , " staschus said .
he adds that such a situation in germany is highly unlikely , because the computer networks that direct the energy flow operate independently of the internet . for johannes altmeppen of vattenfall europe , raising the terrorist alarm is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction . " we 're constantly checking the safety and security of our networks , " he said .
" there is absolutely no reason for anyone to worry about this point .
our security systems are arranged so that it is impossible for anyone to break into them via the internet or with an internet worm .

by late afternoon , power had been restored across most of the country .
-lrb- sept.28 , 2003 -rrb- complete blackout unlikely in germany crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function .
-lrb- aug.16 , 2003 -rrb- what will power germany in the future ?
as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary .

deutsche welle 's john hay spoke with joke-waller hunter , executive secretary of the unfccc about how russia could profit from adopting the kyoto protocol and the impact of global warming . here in europe and in the northern hemisphere in general people have seen an extremely hot summer .
it 's been billed as the hottest summer in 2000 years by some .
does this mean that more people now accept the fact that climate change is happening and that it is being caused by human kind ?
the scientists have already predicted in their models that we will have more extreme weather events in the years to come .
we had the floods in 2002 , the heat wave in europe this year - these are the type of extreme weather events that climate scientists are predicting .
so it certainly raises awareness for the issues .
it draws the attention of politicians to the issue .
i do n't think you would find a scientist who would really say that this is all due to the human impact on the climate , but it certainly helps to get it high on the agenda .
but has n't it been a sort of wake-up call ?
have n't people been coming to you now and saying " we 've doubted the science up to now but now it 's quite obvious that climate change is taking place " ?
people do make those remarks and also many politicians are now aware that this is a very serious issue .
the impacts are not only felt in the developing countries , which are the most vulnerable to climate change - given that their food production is under threat if the climate changes - but they also feel in european countries that something is happening to the climate and that it has huge economic impacts as well as impacts on daily life .
now , there are people in russia who actually welcome climate change , since they say that russia , as a cold country , can do with a little more warmth , that it ca n't do any harm if the temperature rises and that it could actually help increase agricultural output .
what do you say to this ?
well , i think the russians are really going through a very elaborate process of cost- benefit analysis , of which agricultural productivity is one element .
others being what it means for energy exports of russia and energy use in russia .
generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .
russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?
well , the kyoto protocol would enter into force 90 days after the russians have ratified it and have made it clear to the united nations in new york .
so , if we count the 90 days , it 's unlikely because they should have made their move in new york before the 13th of september .
it 's unlikely that when we have our conference of the parties in milan in early december that the protocol will have entered into force .
it would be quite important that we know at the time of the milan meeting when it will enter into force .
we are still quite confident that the russians will move at such a pace that at milan we will know when the protocol will come into force .
that would give an enormously positive signal to the conference , to the parties and to the meeting and would really make people even more aware of the need to implement , what they have agreed in an international context .
and if the russians fail to ratify altogether , what would that mean ?
that 's what is normally referred to as the plan b , which we don ’ t want to think about , but if the kyoto protocol does not enter into force in the very near future , i think the risk of climate fatigue may kick in . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .
although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex train in berlin but the group denies that it intends to try to compete with deutsche bahn in high-speed traffic .
" we have a regional train concept , with our product interconnex .
we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .
although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "

now that u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have patched things up , what 's going on with their two countries ' economic relations ?
deutsche welle 's rolf wenkel offers his reflections . no matter how unfounded and pointless a war may be , if it is waged by americans , the u.s. population always reacts patriotically .
so it came as no surprise that there was an outcry in the german media in the spring .
since german chancellor schröder and french president chirac did n't want to help bush in iraq , the newsmakers lamented , the americans were sure to boycott our fine european products . imprudent archconservative american senators confirmed their fears and issued the calls for boycotts .
and the german media quickly dug up corresponding stories , from the nosedive in sales of french cheese and red wine in the united states , to renaming " french fries " " freedom fries , " to the bavarian company keim that suddenly lost the privilege to coat the pentagon with its special mineral paints . senator steve latourette , - does n't sound all that american , could it be that his grandfather was french ? - a republican from ohio , convinced congress that german paints were not appropriate for the pentagon during wartime , what with the germans on the wrong side . it was definitely a bitter setback for german-american economic relations , despite the fact that keim paints already bedecked the capitol , the new york stock exchange and arlington house at arlington national cemetery near washington .
the firm had even touched up the pentagon 's western façade after one of the planes flew into it on september 11 . strangely quiet since then the experts and business functionaries who tried to persuade us that chancellor schröder damaged german-american business ties with his policies on iraq have been strangely quiet .
not only since gerhard and george shook hands last week in a new york hotel and promised to get along , no , it was strangely quiet even before that . but the explanation is simple : the pundits ran out of steam . already in february a poll carried out in the united states by the consultancy droege showed that not even 1 percent of german firms had recorded measurable declines in business .
there were no indications at all of problems between germans and americans .
on the contrary , the revival of the u.s. economy led to an increase in opportunities for german companies . on the other side of the atlantic , the economic development corporation of north rhine-westphalia revealed that 560 american companies were located in that western german state alone .
their yearly turnover is € 53 billion , and they employ 170,000 people .
on top of that , 39 percent of the companies plan to invest in germany over the next three years . fish stories the clamor about damaged german-american business ties was actually just a crock . but we should have known that from the start .
it 's obvious when you come across news like wednesday 's announcement that munich-based siemens had sealed a $ 200 million deal for its air conditioning , ventilation , fire safety and security systems .
the contractor is the u.s. army ; the parts will be installed in governmental and administrative buildings . besides that , keim from bavaria has been contracted to paint again .
this time , however , it wo n't do the pentagon - the bavarian company lost that contract .
instead , keim will paint the white house . rolf wenkel send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de after meeting with bush , schröder urges " strengthened " u.n. role in iraq following their first meeting in 16 months , german chancellor gerhard schröder and u.s. president george w. bush said they were ready to work together to make iraq safer .

increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .
although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex train in berlin but the group denies that it intends to try to compete with deutsche bahn in high-speed traffic .
" we have a regional train concept , with our product interconnex .
we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2003 kyoto protocol helps russia modernize großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the kyoto protocol gives russia the incentive to modernize its energy market .
deutsche welle 's john hay spoke with joke-waller hunter , executive secretary of the unfccc about how russia could profit from adopting the kyoto protocol and the impact of global warming . here in europe and in the northern hemisphere in general people have seen an extremely hot summer .
it 's been billed as the hottest summer in 2000 years by some .
does this mean that more people now accept the fact that climate change is happening and that it is being caused by human kind ?
the scientists have already predicted in their models that we will have more extreme weather events in the years to come .
we had the floods in 2002 , the heat wave in europe this year - these are the type of extreme weather events that climate scientists are predicting .
so it certainly raises awareness for the issues .
it draws the attention of politicians to the issue .
i do n't think you would find a scientist who would really say that this is all due to the human impact on the climate , but it certainly helps to get it high on the agenda .
but has n't it been a sort of wake-up call ?
have n't people been coming to you now and saying " we 've doubted the science up to now but now it 's quite obvious that climate change is taking place " ?
people do make those remarks and also many politicians are now aware that this is a very serious issue .
the impacts are not only felt in the developing countries , which are the most vulnerable to climate change - given that their food production is under threat if the climate changes - but they also feel in european countries that something is happening to the climate and that it has huge economic impacts as well as impacts on daily life .
now , there are people in russia who actually welcome climate change , since they say that russia , as a cold country , can do with a little more warmth , that it ca n't do any harm if the temperature rises and that it could actually help increase agricultural output .
what do you say to this ?
well , i think the russians are really going through a very elaborate process of cost- benefit analysis , of which agricultural productivity is one element .
others being what it means for energy exports of russia and energy use in russia .
generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .
russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?
well , the kyoto protocol would enter into force 90 days after the russians have ratified it and have made it clear to the united nations in new york .
so , if we count the 90 days , it 's unlikely because they should have made their move in new york before the 13th of september .
it 's unlikely that when we have our conference of the parties in milan in early december that the protocol will have entered into force .
it would be quite important that we know at the time of the milan meeting when it will enter into force .
we are still quite confident that the russians will move at such a pace that at milan we will know when the protocol will come into force .
that would give an enormously positive signal to the conference , to the parties and to the meeting and would really make people even more aware of the need to implement , what they have agreed in an international context .
and if the russians fail to ratify altogether , what would that mean ?
that 's what is normally referred to as the plan b , which we don ’ t want to think about , but if the kyoto protocol does not enter into force in the very near future , i think the risk of climate fatigue may kick in . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

we had the floods in 2002 , the heat wave in europe this year - these are the type of extreme weather events that climate scientists are predicting .
so it certainly raises awareness for the issues .
it draws the attention of politicians to the issue .
i do n't think you would find a scientist who would really say that this is all due to the human impact on the climate , but it certainly helps to get it high on the agenda .
but has n't it been a sort of wake-up call ?
have n't people been coming to you now and saying " we 've doubted the science up to now but now it 's quite obvious that climate change is taking place " ?
people do make those remarks and also many politicians are now aware that this is a very serious issue .
the impacts are not only felt in the developing countries , which are the most vulnerable to climate change - given that their food production is under threat if the climate changes - but they also feel in european countries that something is happening to the climate and that it has huge economic impacts as well as impacts on daily life .
now , there are people in russia who actually welcome climate change , since they say that russia , as a cold country , can do with a little more warmth , that it ca n't do any harm if the temperature rises and that it could actually help increase agricultural output .
what do you say to this ?
well , i think the russians are really going through a very elaborate process of cost- benefit analysis , of which agricultural productivity is one element .
others being what it means for energy exports of russia and energy use in russia .
generally speaking , the expectation of scientists with regard to the impact of climate change on agricultural productivity is that it will decrease agricultural productivity .
and then our colleagues at the bio-diversity convention argue that if a number of the very valuable ecosystems , including some of the ecosystems in the soviet union , were turned into agricultural land - a possibility due to the change in temperature - then it would be a very significant loss to the world 's bio-diversity .
we are most concerned about the agricultural productivity of developing countries because those economies are really dependant on the export of agricultural products to provide the necessary food for their own population .
climate change , combined with and resulting in less water availability , will really have a huge impact on agricultural productivity in many african and asian countries .
i think that 's where we really see a growing concern which can only lead to the farmers and the agricultural research adapting to climate change .
some climate change will be inevitable .
we have come so far that we can not avoid it .
the carbon stays so long in the atmosphere that whatever we do now we will face some climate change because the damage has already been done .
countries do have to adapt and look at other crops that may have a higher productivity with higher concentrations of carbon in the air .
russia is the third biggest polluter in the world , but in many ways it 's a developing country , an emerging economy , especially with regards to the implementation of technology .
at the same time , the russian economy is booming , so there 's a large scope for modernizing industries .
to what extent could this mean that climate friendly technologies are likely to be installed in the future ?
that 's again one of the incentives for the russians to ratify the kyoto protocol because the kyoto protocol would allow joint implementation of projects within the " annex 1 " countries- the industrialized countries- including the economies in transition , like russia and some of the other eastern european countries .
the kyoto protocol would allow much more joint implementation , which would then mean a transfer of technology .
generally speaking , if you would like to reduce your emissions , you benefit if you make your production less energy intensive , which is " win-win " because you have to spend less on the costs for energy and , at the same time , you reduce your emissions .
that 's quite an important element in the overall implementation of climate change measures .
quite a few of them are " win-wins " and not measures that would really harm the economy .
energy intensity of russian production at the moment is high , compared to other countries , japan being an example which has taken very early measures to reduce the energy intensity of the industrial production .
there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that it is both economically attractive and , at the same time , climate friendly .
should the russians fail to ratify before the milan summit , what would that mean for the kyoto process ?
well , the kyoto protocol would enter into force 90 days after the russians have ratified it and have made it clear to the united nations in new york .
so , if we count the 90 days , it 's unlikely because they should have made their move in new york before the 13th of september .
it 's unlikely that when we have our conference of the parties in milan in early december that the protocol will have entered into force .
it would be quite important that we know at the time of the milan meeting when it will enter into force .
we are still quite confident that the russians will move at such a pace that at milan we will know when the protocol will come into force .
that would give an enormously positive signal to the conference , to the parties and to the meeting and would really make people even more aware of the need to implement , what they have agreed in an international context .
and if the russians fail to ratify altogether , what would that mean ?
that 's what is normally referred to as the plan b , which we don ’ t want to think about , but if the kyoto protocol does not enter into force in the very near future , i think the risk of climate fatigue may kick in . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.09.2003 russia delays ratification of kyoto protocol großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a global commitment to reducing carbon dioxide emissions goes up in smoke unless russia ratifies it .
russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .
russia left with casting vote on kyoto agreed to in the japanese city of kyoto in 1997 , the treaty sets individual targets for industrialized countries to lower their emissions of carbon gases , the byproduct of burning fossil fuels , on average by 5.2 percent below their 1990 levels over the next 10 years .
despite the fact that more than 100 mostly developing nations have already ratified the treaty , the environmental pact suffered a serious setback when the united states , which alone accounts for around 35 percent of the world 's greenhouse emissions , pulled out of the treaty in 2001 .
the u.s. argued the treaty would hurt its economy and rejected the scientific claims of global warming .
other industrial nations , like australia , followed the bush administration 's stance .
under the treaty ’ s complex weighting system , countries responsible for producing 55 percent of greenhouse gases , have to approve it before it comes into force .
with the u.s. , arguably the world ’ s largest polluter , out of the fray , the onus is now on russia to ratify kyoto and ensure it takes effect .
galvanizing global action united nations secretary-general kofi annan , in a message to the conference on monday , urged russia to approve kyoto , calling the pact a " vital first step in tackling global challenges of global warning . "
although he stopped short of outwardly criticizing putin , the intent of annan ’ s words were obvious : " i join people throughout the world in eagerly awaiting ratification by the russian federation , which will bring the protocol into force and further galvanize global action . "
joke waller-hunter , executive secretary of the u.n. framework convention on climate change -lrb- unfcc -rrb- , which oversees the kyoto protocol , was much more direct in her criticism of putin .
" i had hoped you would have been more specific in indicating a date for ratification , " she said at the start of the moscow climate conference .
greenpeace echoed her criticism and blasted the leader for taking so long to make a decision .
" president putin has had more than three years to analyze how kyoto could be implemented in russia , and his stalling could now derail the entire process , " a spokesperson said .
moscow wary of investment promises apart from scientific uncertainties , russia is hesitant to sign because of a clause in the treaty allowing for the creation of a " carbon market , " potentially worth billions of dollars a year , where industrialized signatory countries can buy and sell emissions " credits " in order to meet their treaty obligations .
the collapse of the soviet union cut russia 's emissions levels down from the 17 percent figure it had when the quotas were set in 1990 .
as a result , the country has a lot of emission " credits " to sell over-polluters .
but president vladimir putin 's administration is not sure they 'll be any buyers .
" we must receive guarantees , where the money will be put every year .
if we ratify , it could all go to ukraine .
we must have firm guarantees about the amount , " gordeyev stressed on thursday .
the eu , which set the ball rolling on the world ’ s first international emissions trading market earlier this year , has tried to reassure russia investment will flow in .
the unfcc has also chimed in with words of encouragement for the putin government .
" there is huge scope for the russian economy to modernize in such a way that is both economically attractive and at the same time , climate-friendly , " the executive secretary of the u.n. agency , joke-waller hunter , told deutsche welle ahead of putin ’ s announcement on monday .
but despite such urging , putin refuses to get down from the fence and make a decision on ratification .

russia has dashed hopes that the kyoto protocol on lowering greenhouse gas emissions will take effect soon , saying it agrees in principle to the treaty , but wants more time to study the plan . scientists and environmental ministers from around the world turned to moscow on monday awaiting a decision that would seal the fate of the emissions-reducing kyoto protocol .
whether or not the 1997 drafted pact on combating global warming goes into effect rests in the hands of russia .
but the country is wavering on ratification and has refused to give a definite answer , arguing it needs more time to study the treaty .
on thursday , russia , which became the environmental kingmaker after the united states pulled out of the pact in 2001 , delayed a decision on ratifying the protocol , saying it needed time to weigh the consequences before it could be persuaded to sign on the dotted line .
" there is no strict timetable at the moment , " russian deputy prime minister alexei gordeyev told reporters on thursday .
" the government in any country ... has an obligation to decide what steps it needs to take after signing -lrb- the protocol -rrb- .
gordeyev further cited scientific reasons for russia ’ s wavering stance .
" the russian government looks on the kyoto protocol positively , but we say that the protocol , especially concerning scientific matters , leaves a lot of questions unanswered , " he said .
on monday , at the opening of a five-day world climate change conference in moscow , russian president vladimir putin officially postponed a decision on the protocol , saying , " the government is closely studying and examining this question . "
" this is part of a complex of difficult and unclear problems .
a decision will be taken when this work is finished , " putin announced without giving any indication of when that could be .
for environmentalists , the russian delay is yet another setback on the road to securing a global commitment to rein in emissions of gases like carbon dioxide from factories and cars , blamed for raising temperatures and creating climatic havoc .

power is being restored in italy following sunday 's massive blackout - the fourth major western power cut in two months .
now many in germany are wondering if it could happen here . following an accident on a power supply line in switzerland , it was only a matter of seconds before grid failure spread , leaving italy in darkness on sunday night .
germany 's energy providers reacted quickly , taking measures to prevent the power outage from affecting the german network . according to johannes altmeppen , spokesman for the country 's third largest energy company , vattenfall europe , extra power pumps were immediately activated to use up excess energy , preventing a power surge beyond the normal network frequency of 50 hertz . germany better prepared so was germany just lucky this time ?
or is the german network superior to those in north america , london and scandinavia , all places which , like italy , have suffered major outages recently ? altmeppen says it is .
" italy did n't exactly come as a surprise , " he told dw-world .
" italy does n't produce enough energy for its needs , so it has to import power , mainly from france and switzerland , and that 's not good .

italian officials disagree over who is to blame for their blackout .
in each case , terrorist activity has been dismissed . terrorist motives ? but konstantin staschus , the director of germany 's association of network operators -lrb- verband der netzbetreiber -rrb- says the question is still being asked : could terrorists succeed in bringing an entire country to a standstill if they were to gain access to the power supply via the internet ? " energy providers are asking themselves that question , not just because of the threat of terrorism , but also because of the threat from internet viruses and worms , " staschus said .
he adds that such a situation in germany is highly unlikely , because the computer networks that direct the energy flow operate independently of the internet . for johannes altmeppen of vattenfall europe , raising the terrorist alarm is nothing more than a knee-jerk reaction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.09.2003 connex 's german presence expands with sylt route großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : starting in 2005 , beach lovers can take connex trains to sylt as the deutsche bahn struggles with negative headlines , french-owned connex muscles in on as much of the german rail giant 's turf as possible . a pricing system fiasco , further job cuts , compeititon from low-cost airlines , delayed trains , empty compartments and yet more red ink – these are the sorts of headlines deutsche bahn has been making lately .
increasing the pressure is competition from private rail concern connex , which just won a bid to run passenger traffic from cologne , berlin and hamburg to the german resort island of sylt .
connex , a subsidiary of the french conglomerate veoli environnement , has been pursuing a bold growth strategy in germany over the past several years by bidding on operating rights for numerous local and long-distance passenger rail lines .
although state-backed deutsche bahn -lrb- the state is the single largest shareholder in the private company -rrb- is legally obliged to sell off rail lines and train stations as part of a government ordained liberalization that until now has mainly affected local passenger routes , connex has had a hard time making inroads in germany 's rail system . represented by its frankfurt-based connex verkehr subsidiary , the french company so far has only managed to offer long-distance service on a few routes in germany .
in june it opened up a route from cologne to halle and rostock , in eastern germany , and earlier in the year it began service between berlin and hamburg .
the company says it is now filling around 45 percent of its seats , but needs to fill 60 percent in order to make a profit .
nevertheless , connex is germany 's second largest long-distance rail provider .
distance routes cheaper and it just expanded its offerings .
starting in 2005 , connex trains will shuttle passengers from cologne and berlin to the resort island of sylt via hamburg .
the contract will last for 10 years .
for consumers , this means lower prices .
because the connection between sylt and hamburg is considered local traffic , " we ca n't set our own prices due to tariff regulations , " says connex spokesman andreas winter .
however , on long distance stretches , like those from cologne and berlin to hamburg , " we will be half as expensive as deutsche bahn . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex train in berlin but the group denies that it intends to try to compete with deutsche bahn in high-speed traffic .
" we have a regional train concept , with our product interconnex .
we are not trying to compete with the ice , " the superfast trains that service larger german cities , winter says .
in germany , connex took in about € 260 million in the past year , the company has yet to show a profit .
however , winter said , " we hope to -lrb- be profitable -rrb- by next year .
we belong to a listed company , so we ca n't afford to stay in the red for a long period of time . "
going through the courts only 10 percent of local german rail lines have been put up for bid thus far .
deciding which lines can be sold is largely left up to the states – and sometimes the courts .
so far , connex has won about a third of the german competitive bids .
in contrast , deutsche bahn still runs some 90 percent of local train traffic .
in the case of the sylt line , the state of sachsen-anhalt opened the bid up for competition .
but getting a foothold in a monopolized market is n't always so easy .
in brandenburg , for example , connex filed a suit complaining that deutsche bahn had been awarded a local rail contract worth billions of euros , without a competitive bid .
in early september , the high court in brandenburg rejected the suit , saying there was no legal obligation to put the contract for local passenger traffic up for bid .
yet connex had won an earlier , similar suit in sachsen-anhalt .
consequently , the german government enacted an order saying that a certain amount of local traffic routes can be allocated without competitive bidding .
yet the outlook is n't entirely bleak , notes winter .
" the various states are very different from one another .
schleswig-holstein strongly suports competition . "
a welcoming market indeed , germany 's market is relatively welcoming , company executives say .
stéphane richard , chairman of the board of connex , told the süddeustche zeitung newspaper that , in terms of liberalizing its markets , " france is a turtle . "
and germany also compares well to england , where connex recently lost its license due to chronic lateness – a problem the company says is because of an english failure to invest in the railway tracks there .
in addition to its latest german contract , connex recently won the bid to run local trains around the u.s. city of boston for five years , a deal expected to up turnover by some $ 1 billion -lrb- € 87 million -rrb- a year .
asked by deutsche welle what connex has to offer the german market that deutsche bahn does n't , spokesman winter cited connex 's simple tariff structure , as well as a business structure and approach that puts the client first .

now that u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder have patched things up , what 's going on with their two countries ' economic relations ?
deutsche welle 's rolf wenkel offers his reflections . no matter how unfounded and pointless a war may be , if it is waged by americans , the u.s. population always reacts patriotically .
so it came as no surprise that there was an outcry in the german media in the spring .
since german chancellor schröder and french president chirac did n't want to help bush in iraq , the newsmakers lamented , the americans were sure to boycott our fine european products . imprudent archconservative american senators confirmed their fears and issued the calls for boycotts .
and the german media quickly dug up corresponding stories , from the nosedive in sales of french cheese and red wine in the united states , to renaming " french fries " " freedom fries , " to the bavarian company keim that suddenly lost the privilege to coat the pentagon with its special mineral paints . senator steve latourette , - does n't sound all that american , could it be that his grandfather was french ? - a republican from ohio , convinced congress that german paints were not appropriate for the pentagon during wartime , what with the germans on the wrong side . it was definitely a bitter setback for german-american economic relations , despite the fact that keim paints already bedecked the capitol , the new york stock exchange and arlington house at arlington national cemetery near washington .
the firm had even touched up the pentagon 's western façade after one of the planes flew into it on september 11 . strangely quiet since then the experts and business functionaries who tried to persuade us that chancellor schröder damaged german-american business ties with his policies on iraq have been strangely quiet .
not only since gerhard and george shook hands last week in a new york hotel and promised to get along , no , it was strangely quiet even before that . but the explanation is simple : the pundits ran out of steam . already in february a poll carried out in the united states by the consultancy droege showed that not even 1 percent of german firms had recorded measurable declines in business .
there were no indications at all of problems between germans and americans .
on the contrary , the revival of the u.s. economy led to an increase in opportunities for german companies . on the other side of the atlantic , the economic development corporation of north rhine-westphalia revealed that 560 american companies were located in that western german state alone .
their yearly turnover is € 53 billion , and they employ 170,000 people .
on top of that , 39 percent of the companies plan to invest in germany over the next three years . fish stories the clamor about damaged german-american business ties was actually just a crock . but we should have known that from the start .
it 's obvious when you come across news like wednesday 's announcement that munich-based siemens had sealed a $ 200 million deal for its air conditioning , ventilation , fire safety and security systems .
the contractor is the u.s. army ; the parts will be installed in governmental and administrative buildings . besides that , keim from bavaria has been contracted to paint again .

the two-week initiative is part of operation safer streets which was first introduced in february 2001 .
the metropolitan police say about 50 % of all street crime involves mobile phones and they should be kept out of sight in crime hotspots like train and tube stations .
the message " out of sight is safer " will appear on posters on trains and buses , at stations and in high streets .
assistant commissioner tim godwin said the public had a role to play in reducing crime .
" the message is simple : keep valuables out of sight whenever possible , especially at crime hotspots like tube and train stations .
" when you do have to take your phone or cash out in a public place , be aware of who 's around you .
street robbers tend to be opportunistic - do n't make yourself an easy target . "
operation safer streets was first introduced in nine boroughs but later became london-wide .
the met claims it has brought street crime down from 7,000 reported offences a month in late 2001 to about 5,000 in 2002 and 2003 .

yukichi chuganji 's family said he died of natural causes at home on the island of kyushu - also birthplace of the world 's oldest woman , kamato hongo , who turned 116 last tuesday .
mr chuganji graduated from technical school at the start of the 20th century .
he drank milk every day , but did not consume alcohol .
there are an estimated 15,000 people in japan over the age of 100 , most of them women .
last words family members said mr chuganji died on sunday evening in his bed in ogoori city , about 900 kilometres -lrb- 560 miles -rrb- southwest of tokyo .
he said ' thank you , it was good , ' when kyoko gave him home-made apple juice ... and it turned out -lrb- to be -rrb- his last words yukichi chuganji 's nephew " -lrb- he -rrb- passed away on sunday evening ... as he was sleeping , " his nephew tadao haji was quoted as saying by the afp news agency .
mr chuganji - who was recognised by guinness world records as the oldest man - lived with his daughter , kyoko , and her family .
" he said ' thank you , it was good , ' when kyoko gave him home-made apple juice around 1800 -lrb- 1100 gmt -rrb- , and it turned out -lrb- to be -rrb- his last words , " mr haji said .
he added that his uncle then had become sick and died by the time a doctor arrived .
greying nation mr chuganji had been in good health , but had not ventured from his bed very often in recent years .
kamato hongo sleeps for two days then stays awake for two days born on 23 march 1889 , he attributed his own longevity to healthy eating and being an optimist .
" he hates vegetables but loves to eat meat and drink milk , " his daughter once said .
she said his favourite meal had been boiled rice mixed with bits of chicken meat .
with mr chuganji 's death , 108-year-old kameni nakamura is now believed to be japan 's oldest man .
however , it remains to be seen if he is also to inherit the mantle of the world 's oldest man .
japan has the world 's longest life expectancy - 78 years for men and 80 for women .
but experts say there is a downside in japan to this otherwise rosy picture of health .
the country is an ageing society with a shrinking workforce , which must support more and more retired people .
economists are predicting a crisis in the state pension system within a few years , because the benefits being paid out far exceed payments being made into it .

so for some the news that pompey had poached the global challenge yacht race from the self-styled " home of ocean sailing " ranked with portsmouth fc 's elevation to the premiership .
it was sweeter still coming so soon after portsmouth gave a new home to southampton 's shipbuilding industry when the vosper thornycroft yard moved down the coast .
so is this just a temporary blip in southampton 's ability to lord it over its south coast neighbour , or a sign of things to come ?
a flurry of activity in the waterfront area , the gunwharf quays shopping development , the redevelopment of the harbour , and the forthcoming spinnaker tower are all combining to give portsmouth a much larger presence . "
i think portsmouth has a heart and southampton has n't - portsmouth has the pressures that make the blood pump through the arteries " graham hurley , author the tower in particular seems set to be become a national and international symbol of the city , as local author graham hurley says , to " literally pin pompey to the map " .
soaring 500 feet -lrb- 150 metres -rrb- from its gunwharf quays site , it will be the first thing seen by the hundreds of thousands of ferry passengers who pass through the city every year .
talking to portsmouth 's great and good , they fairly bubble with enthusiasm as they reel out a list of major events coming to the city .
in addition to the global challenge , they point to the great south run , the forthcoming anniversary of the battle of trafalgar , a possible return for the tour de france , the tall ships race and the festival of the sea .
for portsmouth south mp mike hancock though , it is vosper 's arrival that is most significant for the city .
" bringing vospers here was the breakthrough , we had to get industry again to take portsmouth as a serious player .
it 's a big difference in our fortunes , " he said .
the company was forced to move from its woolston home of 100 years after it became clear the site was too small for expansion .
mr hancock continued : " i think southampton had got a bit complacent , they felt they had everything there , and people and business would just go there as a matter of course . "
" uncursed by money " while officials in portsmouth refer you to their naval history and historic dockyard as much as the glitzy new developments of port solent and gunwharf , their sotonian counterparts invariably point to the west quay shopping centre , and how it has pushed southampton up the retail shopping index -lrb- up from 20th to seventh -rrb- .
impressive though west quay undoubtedly is , it is hard to get people excited and proud of a retail establishment , even if it the largest city centre shopping development in europe .
visitors to southampton might expect some reminder of its romantic past as the home of the great cruise liners and the port from which the titanic sailed 90 years ago .
aside from a forgotten monument in a city centre park , they would be disappointed .
maritime history mr hurley , who also lived in southampton for 20 years , believes the difference lies in the way the two cities developed through their maritime history .
" moneyed people passed through southampton , on their way to the cruise liners , but never left their mark on it , " he said .
he compares this to the way that generations of sailors have left their mark on portsmouth , and the civic pride that developed .
" i think portsmouth has a heart and southampton has n't - portsmouth has the pressures that make the blood pump through the arteries , and i never found that with southampton at all , " he said .
as he points out , portsmouth has several advantages over its south coast rival , in particular it has a real , accessible waterfront area while southampton is surrounded by a container port and industry on all sides .
the millennium project to redevelop portsmouth 's harbour has turned it into a real asset , and with more professional people expected to choose to live in portsmouth .
" people really appreciate it , you go down on a saturday or a sunday and it 's packed , " said mr hurley .
' healthy competition ' dr alan whitehead , southampton test mp and former leader of southampton city council , accepts portsmouth is making the most of its advantages , but dismisses the idea that it signifies a long-term change .
he says in his experience the relative fortunes of the cities change regularly .
" it goes in waves , when i became leader of the council in 1984 there was no building work at all -lrb- in southampton -rrb- , then ocean village happened and town quay - now portsmouth is developing . "
while southampton officials are keen to portray the global challenge decision as a one-off , with the yacht race to return once ocean village is redeveloped , they must be concerned for the future of the jewel in the crown , the whitbread round the world race .
the former incarnation of ocean village , with its bars and restaurants , died a slow death only a decade after opening , and is being replaced with mainly luxury flats - hardly ideal for hosting a sailing event .
a final piece of redevelopment may be to move the ' home of ocean sailing ' sign about twenty miles to the east ...

when complete , the spinnaker tower " will pin pompey to the map " so for some the news that pompey had poached the global challenge yacht race from the self-styled " home of ocean sailing " ranked with portsmouth fc 's elevation to the premiership .
it was sweeter still coming so soon after portsmouth gave a new home to southampton 's shipbuilding industry when the vosper thornycroft yard moved down the coast .
so is this just a temporary blip in southampton 's ability to lord it over its south coast neighbour , or a sign of things to come ?
a flurry of activity in the waterfront area , the gunwharf quays shopping development , the redevelopment of the harbour , and the forthcoming spinnaker tower are all combining to give portsmouth a much larger presence .
i think portsmouth has a heart and southampton has n't - portsmouth has the pressures that make the blood pump through the arteries graham hurley , author the tower in particular seems set to be become a national and international symbol of the city , as local author graham hurley says , to " literally pin pompey to the map " .
soaring 500 feet -lrb- 150 metres -rrb- from its gunwharf quays site , it will be the first thing seen by the hundreds of thousands of ferry passengers who pass through the city every year .
talking to portsmouth 's great and good , they fairly bubble with enthusiasm as they reel out a list of major events coming to the city .
in addition to the global challenge , they point to the great south run , the forthcoming anniversary of the battle of trafalgar , a possible return for the tour de france , the tall ships race and the festival of the sea .
for portsmouth south mp mike hancock though , it is vosper 's arrival that is most significant for the city .
the vospers shipyard had been based in southampton for a century " bringing vospers here was the breakthrough , we had to get industry again to take portsmouth as a serious player .
it 's a big difference in our fortunes , " he said .
the company was forced to move from its woolston home of 100 years after it became clear the site was too small for expansion .
mr hancock continued : " i think southampton had got a bit complacent , they felt they had everything there , and people and business would just go there as a matter of course . "
" uncursed by money " while officials in portsmouth refer you to their naval history and historic dockyard as much as the glitzy new developments of port solent and gunwharf , their sotonian counterparts invariably point to the west quay shopping centre , and how it has pushed southampton up the retail shopping index -lrb- up from 20th to seventh -rrb- .
southampton 's west quay centre opened in september 2000 impressive though west quay undoubtedly is , it is hard to get people excited and proud of a retail establishment , even if it the largest city centre shopping development in europe .
visitors to southampton might expect some reminder of its romantic past as the home of the great cruise liners and the port from which the titanic sailed 90 years ago .
aside from a forgotten monument in a city centre park , they would be disappointed .
maritime history mr hurley , who also lived in southampton for 20 years , believes the difference lies in the way the two cities developed through their maritime history .
" moneyed people passed through southampton , on their way to the cruise liners , but never left their mark on it , " he said .
he compares this to the way that generations of sailors have left their mark on portsmouth , and the civic pride that developed .
" i think portsmouth has a heart and southampton has n't - portsmouth has the pressures that make the blood pump through the arteries , and i never found that with southampton at all , " he said .
as he points out , portsmouth has several advantages over its south coast rival , in particular it has a real , accessible waterfront area while southampton is surrounded by a container port and industry on all sides .
the millennium project to redevelop portsmouth 's harbour has turned it into a real asset , and with more professional people expected to choose to live in portsmouth .
" people really appreciate it , you go down on a saturday or a sunday and it 's packed , " said mr hurley .
' healthy competition ' dr alan whitehead , southampton test mp and former leader of southampton city council , accepts portsmouth is making the most of its advantages , but dismisses the idea that it signifies a long-term change .
he says in his experience the relative fortunes of the cities change regularly .
" it goes in waves , when i became leader of the council in 1984 there was no building work at all -lrb- in southampton -rrb- , then ocean village happened and town quay - now portsmouth is developing . "
while southampton officials are keen to portray the global challenge decision as a one-off , with the yacht race to return once ocean village is redeveloped , they must be concerned for the future of the jewel in the crown , the whitbread round the world race .

" uncursed by money " while officials in portsmouth refer you to their naval history and historic dockyard as much as the glitzy new developments of port solent and gunwharf , their sotonian counterparts invariably point to the west quay shopping centre , and how it has pushed southampton up the retail shopping index -lrb- up from 20th to seventh -rrb- .
southampton 's west quay centre opened in september 2000 impressive though west quay undoubtedly is , it is hard to get people excited and proud of a retail establishment , even if it the largest city centre shopping development in europe .
visitors to southampton might expect some reminder of its romantic past as the home of the great cruise liners and the port from which the titanic sailed 90 years ago .
aside from a forgotten monument in a city centre park , they would be disappointed .
maritime history mr hurley , who also lived in southampton for 20 years , believes the difference lies in the way the two cities developed through their maritime history .
" moneyed people passed through southampton , on their way to the cruise liners , but never left their mark on it , " he said .
he compares this to the way that generations of sailors have left their mark on portsmouth , and the civic pride that developed .
" i think portsmouth has a heart and southampton has n't - portsmouth has the pressures that make the blood pump through the arteries , and i never found that with southampton at all , " he said .
as he points out , portsmouth has several advantages over its south coast rival , in particular it has a real , accessible waterfront area while southampton is surrounded by a container port and industry on all sides .
the millennium project to redevelop portsmouth 's harbour has turned it into a real asset , and with more professional people expected to choose to live in portsmouth .
" people really appreciate it , you go down on a saturday or a sunday and it 's packed , " said mr hurley .
' healthy competition ' dr alan whitehead , southampton test mp and former leader of southampton city council , accepts portsmouth is making the most of its advantages , but dismisses the idea that it signifies a long-term change .
he says in his experience the relative fortunes of the cities change regularly .
" it goes in waves , when i became leader of the council in 1984 there was no building work at all -lrb- in southampton -rrb- , then ocean village happened and town quay - now portsmouth is developing . "
while southampton officials are keen to portray the global challenge decision as a one-off , with the yacht race to return once ocean village is redeveloped , they must be concerned for the future of the jewel in the crown , the whitbread round the world race .
the former incarnation of ocean village , with its bars and restaurants , died a slow death only a decade after opening , and is being replaced with mainly luxury flats - hardly ideal for hosting a sailing event .
a final piece of redevelopment may be to move the ' home of ocean sailing ' sign about twenty miles to the east ...

when complete , the spinnaker tower " will pin pompey to the map " so for some the news that pompey had poached the global challenge yacht race from the self-styled " home of ocean sailing " ranked with portsmouth fc 's elevation to the premiership .
it was sweeter still coming so soon after portsmouth gave a new home to southampton 's shipbuilding industry when the vosper thornycroft yard moved down the coast .
so is this just a temporary blip in southampton 's ability to lord it over its south coast neighbour , or a sign of things to come ?
a flurry of activity in the waterfront area , the gunwharf quays shopping development , the redevelopment of the harbour , and the forthcoming spinnaker tower are all combining to give portsmouth a much larger presence .
i think portsmouth has a heart and southampton has n't - portsmouth has the pressures that make the blood pump through the arteries graham hurley , author the tower in particular seems set to be become a national and international symbol of the city , as local author graham hurley says , to " literally pin pompey to the map " .
soaring 500 feet -lrb- 150 metres -rrb- from its gunwharf quays site , it will be the first thing seen by the hundreds of thousands of ferry passengers who pass through the city every year .
talking to portsmouth 's great and good , they fairly bubble with enthusiasm as they reel out a list of major events coming to the city .
in addition to the global challenge , they point to the great south run , the forthcoming anniversary of the battle of trafalgar , a possible return for the tour de france , the tall ships race and the festival of the sea .
for portsmouth south mp mike hancock though , it is vosper 's arrival that is most significant for the city .
the vospers shipyard had been based in southampton for a century " bringing vospers here was the breakthrough , we had to get industry again to take portsmouth as a serious player .
it 's a big difference in our fortunes , " he said .
the company was forced to move from its woolston home of 100 years after it became clear the site was too small for expansion .
mr hancock continued : " i think southampton had got a bit complacent , they felt they had everything there , and people and business would just go there as a matter of course . "
" uncursed by money " while officials in portsmouth refer you to their naval history and historic dockyard as much as the glitzy new developments of port solent and gunwharf , their sotonian counterparts invariably point to the west quay shopping centre , and how it has pushed southampton up the retail shopping index -lrb- up from 20th to seventh -rrb- .
southampton 's west quay centre opened in september 2000 impressive though west quay undoubtedly is , it is hard to get people excited and proud of a retail establishment , even if it the largest city centre shopping development in europe .
visitors to southampton might expect some reminder of its romantic past as the home of the great cruise liners and the port from which the titanic sailed 90 years ago .
aside from a forgotten monument in a city centre park , they would be disappointed .
maritime history mr hurley , who also lived in southampton for 20 years , believes the difference lies in the way the two cities developed through their maritime history .
" moneyed people passed through southampton , on their way to the cruise liners , but never left their mark on it , " he said .
he compares this to the way that generations of sailors have left their mark on portsmouth , and the civic pride that developed .
" i think portsmouth has a heart and southampton has n't - portsmouth has the pressures that make the blood pump through the arteries , and i never found that with southampton at all , " he said .
as he points out , portsmouth has several advantages over its south coast rival , in particular it has a real , accessible waterfront area while southampton is surrounded by a container port and industry on all sides .
the millennium project to redevelop portsmouth 's harbour has turned it into a real asset , and with more professional people expected to choose to live in portsmouth .
" people really appreciate it , you go down on a saturday or a sunday and it 's packed , " said mr hurley .
' healthy competition ' dr alan whitehead , southampton test mp and former leader of southampton city council , accepts portsmouth is making the most of its advantages , but dismisses the idea that it signifies a long-term change .
he says in his experience the relative fortunes of the cities change regularly .
" it goes in waves , when i became leader of the council in 1984 there was no building work at all -lrb- in southampton -rrb- , then ocean village happened and town quay - now portsmouth is developing . "
while southampton officials are keen to portray the global challenge decision as a one-off , with the yacht race to return once ocean village is redeveloped , they must be concerned for the future of the jewel in the crown , the whitbread round the world race .
the former incarnation of ocean village , with its bars and restaurants , died a slow death only a decade after opening , and is being replaced with mainly luxury flats - hardly ideal for hosting a sailing event .
a final piece of redevelopment may be to move the ' home of ocean sailing ' sign about twenty miles to the east ...
