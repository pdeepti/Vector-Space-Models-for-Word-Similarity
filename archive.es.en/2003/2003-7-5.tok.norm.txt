at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues . only two weeks after its presentation at an eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , the debate over provisions in the draft european constitution has broken out again in brussels .
before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .
the german government 's " corrections " are among them .
leading the list of changes berlin wants implemented is language that would permit decisions on immigration and asylum policy to be made by a qualified majority decision in brussels .
on friday , foreign minister joschka fischer repeated his government 's demand that it be permitted to retain veto power on such decisions .
" the question of immigration policy remains a particularly sensitive domestic issue " for germany , fischer told the convention .
he said the majority rules provision in the constitution was unacceptable to the german government .
before eu countries can rule on immigration policies by majority vote , he said , they must first agree to common foundations for immigration .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , interior minister otto schilly and the opposition christian democratic union have all rejected eu majority decisions on immigration policy .
germany 's resistance has been fueled by its own domestic paralysis over the issue .
the country 's first-ever immigration bill was recently rejected in the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber , and the government and opposition parties are still seeking a compromise .
support for majority votes on some policies but in a number of other areas , germany has championed the use of the qualified majority voting in decision-making , including the areas of foreign and security policy .
on friday , germany called for foundations to be laid in the constitution for eu justice and domestic policies that would allow for the creation of a european border police and a european prosecutor .
the convention presidency has said it wants to retain veto power in the constitution for tax policy – especially indirect taxes that are necessary for the development of the internal market .
britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .

before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .
the german government 's " corrections " are among them .
leading the list of changes berlin wants implemented is language that would permit decisions on immigration and asylum policy to be made by a qualified majority decision in brussels .
on friday , foreign minister joschka fischer repeated his government 's demand that it be permitted to retain veto power on such decisions .
" the question of immigration policy remains a particularly sensitive domestic issue " for germany , fischer told the convention .
he said the majority rules provision in the constitution was unacceptable to the german government .
before eu countries can rule on immigration policies by majority vote , he said , they must first agree to common foundations for immigration .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , interior minister otto schilly and the opposition christian democratic union have all rejected eu majority decisions on immigration policy .
germany 's resistance has been fueled by its own domestic paralysis over the issue .
the country 's first-ever immigration bill was recently rejected in the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber , and the government and opposition parties are still seeking a compromise .
support for majority votes on some policies but in a number of other areas , germany has championed the use of the qualified majority voting in decision-making , including the areas of foreign and security policy .
on friday , germany called for foundations to be laid in the constitution for eu justice and domestic policies that would allow for the creation of a european border police and a european prosecutor .
the convention presidency has said it wants to retain veto power in the constitution for tax policy – especially indirect taxes that are necessary for the development of the internal market .
britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .
the draft was greeted unanimously by eu leaders , and the final text of the document is to be hammered out at an intergovernmental conference slated to convene in october .

with the arrival of the first bundeswehr transport plane in uganda , the german military begins its limited peacekeeping mission as part of the eu contingent sent to maintain stability in strife-torn congo . the german military ’ s first transport plane touched down in entebbe , uganda , on friday , loaded with materials for the french-led eu troops deployed across the border in the northeastern region of congo .
the arrival of the transall cargo plane marks the start of a limited military mission , which was approved by german parliament two weeks ago .
the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said defense minister peter struck in justification for germany ’ s limited offer of transport and logistical help .
all totaled there are about 100 german soldiers participating in the peacekeeping mission , far fewer than the 350 originally called for in the mandate .
eight german officers are lending their support in the headquarters for the eu congo mission in paris , and one medevac airbus - a fully-equipped emergency flying hospital - based in cologne has been placed on alert .
the german parliament restricted the mandate to three months , a time frame lieutenant colonel katz is certain will not be prolonged .
" we are assuming that the mission will be over on september 1 . "
with such a short time frame and a limited field of operation , germany has intentionally placed restrictions on its contribution to the peacekeeping mission .

at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .
authorities are saying it 's the work of chechen terrorists . several explosions , detonated by two female suicide bombers , went off during a heavily-visited outdoor rock festival on the outskirts of moscow on saturday , killing at least 18 and seriously injuring many more , russian police sources were quoted as telling the interfax news agency .
police and officials from the russian interior ministry reportedly said terror attacks were the cause of the explosions .
police spokeswoman valery gribakin told the agency that two suspicious-looking woman had been detained at the entrance to the festival , and upon being questioned detonated bombs they were wearing .
after the first blast went off at 2:39 local time -lrb- 10:52 gmt -rrb- it was followed up by a second . there are also reports that a third bomb exploded at a nearby market , security services told russian news agencies .
police investigating the attack told the russian news agency itar-tass that the two women had strapped 500 grams -lrb- 18 ounces -rrb- of dynamite around themselves .

the organizers for the popular rock festival , which was put on by a local radio station at the city 's airfield , said some 20,000 people were at the day-long event .
a terrorist attack ?
the exact reason behind the suicide attack is still uncertain , and so far there has been no claim of responsibility .
but the russian state prosecutor 's office has launched an immediate investigation into " terrorism " interfax said .
interior minister boris gryzlov has pinpointed chechen separatists , who are fighting to sever their mainly muslim region from the rest of russia .
" today -lsb- saturday -rsb- president putin signed a decree on elections in chechnya , and one can think that these attacks are linked to this event , " he told journalists gathered at the scene of the blasts .
the decree , which is part of vladimir putin 's controversial peace plan for the war-torn state in the caucasus mountains , calls for kremlin-run local presidential elections in chechnya on october .
putin launched the plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but guerrillas , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected putin 's peace plan and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2003 german troops begin congo mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transall cargo planes will be heading for uganda as part of its congo peacekeeping mission .
with the arrival of the first bundeswehr transport plane in uganda , the german military begins its limited peacekeeping mission as part of the eu contingent sent to maintain stability in strife-torn congo . the german military ’ s first transport plane touched down in entebbe , uganda , on friday , loaded with materials for the french-led eu troops deployed across the border in the northeastern region of congo .
the arrival of the transall cargo plane marks the start of a limited military mission , which was approved by german parliament two weeks ago .
the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said defense minister peter struck in justification for germany ’ s limited offer of transport and logistical help .
all totaled there are about 100 german soldiers participating in the peacekeeping mission , far fewer than the 350 originally called for in the mandate .
eight german officers are lending their support in the headquarters for the eu congo mission in paris , and one medevac airbus - a fully-equipped emergency flying hospital - based in cologne has been placed on alert .
the german parliament restricted the mandate to three months , a time frame lieutenant colonel katz is certain will not be prolonged .
" we are assuming that the mission will be over on september 1 . "
with such a short time frame and a limited field of operation , germany has intentionally placed restrictions on its contribution to the peacekeeping mission .
in the end it is not much more than a political signal of support to its neighbor france and the other eu members who are sending troops into the battlefield . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german troops to help restore peace in congo the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .

did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?
berlusconi said on friday he did not offer germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder an apology for a nazi slur he made in the eu parliament on wednesday . just as things looked like they were finally calming down , he ’ s done it again .
italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .
" yesterday i made no apology , " he said defiantly at a press conference in rome , which was initially intended to set the tone of the italian eu presidency for the next six months .
instead , the meeting was overshadowed by a diplomatic imbroglio of berlusconi ’ s own making .
the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "
neither chancellor schröder nor foreign minister joschka fischer would comment on berlusconi ’ s most recent statements .
for them , anda said , the issue is resolved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 05.07.2003 germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is calling for a few " corrections " to the eu 's draft constitution .
at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues . only two weeks after its presentation at an eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , the debate over provisions in the draft european constitution has broken out again in brussels .
before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .
the german government 's " corrections " are among them .
leading the list of changes berlin wants implemented is language that would permit decisions on immigration and asylum policy to be made by a qualified majority decision in brussels .
on friday , foreign minister joschka fischer repeated his government 's demand that it be permitted to retain veto power on such decisions .
" the question of immigration policy remains a particularly sensitive domestic issue " for germany , fischer told the convention .
he said the majority rules provision in the constitution was unacceptable to the german government .
before eu countries can rule on immigration policies by majority vote , he said , they must first agree to common foundations for immigration .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , interior minister otto schilly and the opposition christian democratic union have all rejected eu majority decisions on immigration policy .
germany 's resistance has been fueled by its own domestic paralysis over the issue .
the country 's first-ever immigration bill was recently rejected in the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber , and the government and opposition parties are still seeking a compromise .
support for majority votes on some policies but in a number of other areas , germany has championed the use of the qualified majority voting in decision-making , including the areas of foreign and security policy .
on friday , germany called for foundations to be laid in the constitution for eu justice and domestic policies that would allow for the creation of a european border police and a european prosecutor .
the convention presidency has said it wants to retain veto power in the constitution for tax policy – especially indirect taxes that are necessary for the development of the internal market .
britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .
the draft was greeted unanimously by eu leaders , and the final text of the document is to be hammered out at an intergovernmental conference slated to convene in october .

did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?
berlusconi said on friday he did not offer germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder an apology for a nazi slur he made in the eu parliament on wednesday . just as things looked like they were finally calming down , he ’ s done it again .
italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .
" yesterday i made no apology , " he said defiantly at a press conference in rome , which was initially intended to set the tone of the italian eu presidency for the next six months .
instead , the meeting was overshadowed by a diplomatic imbroglio of berlusconi ’ s own making .
the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "
neither chancellor schröder nor foreign minister joschka fischer would comment on berlusconi ’ s most recent statements .
for them , anda said , the issue is resolved .

at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .
authorities are saying it 's the work of chechen terrorists . several explosions , detonated by two female suicide bombers , went off during a heavily-visited outdoor rock festival on the outskirts of moscow on saturday , killing at least 18 and seriously injuring many more , russian police sources were quoted as telling the interfax news agency .
police and officials from the russian interior ministry reportedly said terror attacks were the cause of the explosions .
police spokeswoman valery gribakin told the agency that two suspicious-looking woman had been detained at the entrance to the festival , and upon being questioned detonated bombs they were wearing .
after the first blast went off at 2:39 local time -lrb- 10:52 gmt -rrb- it was followed up by a second . there are also reports that a third bomb exploded at a nearby market , security services told russian news agencies .
police investigating the attack told the russian news agency itar-tass that the two women had strapped 500 grams -lrb- 18 ounces -rrb- of dynamite around themselves .

a terrorist attack ?
the exact reason behind the suicide attack is still uncertain , and so far there has been no claim of responsibility .
but the russian state prosecutor 's office has launched an immediate investigation into " terrorism " interfax said .
interior minister boris gryzlov has pinpointed chechen separatists , who are fighting to sever their mainly muslim region from the rest of russia .
" today -lsb- saturday -rsb- president putin signed a decree on elections in chechnya , and one can think that these attacks are linked to this event , " he told journalists gathered at the scene of the blasts .
the decree , which is part of vladimir putin 's controversial peace plan for the war-torn state in the caucasus mountains , calls for kremlin-run local presidential elections in chechnya on october .
putin launched the plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but guerrillas , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected putin 's peace plan and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military .

at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues . only two weeks after its presentation at an eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , the debate over provisions in the draft european constitution has broken out again in brussels .
before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .

britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .
the draft was greeted unanimously by eu leaders , and the final text of the document is to be hammered out at an intergovernmental conference slated to convene in october .

with the arrival of the first bundeswehr transport plane in uganda , the german military begins its limited peacekeeping mission as part of the eu contingent sent to maintain stability in strife-torn congo . the german military ’ s first transport plane touched down in entebbe , uganda , on friday , loaded with materials for the french-led eu troops deployed across the border in the northeastern region of congo .
the arrival of the transall cargo plane marks the start of a limited military mission , which was approved by german parliament two weeks ago .
the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said defense minister peter struck in justification for germany ’ s limited offer of transport and logistical help .
all totaled there are about 100 german soldiers participating in the peacekeeping mission , far fewer than the 350 originally called for in the mandate .
eight german officers are lending their support in the headquarters for the eu congo mission in paris , and one medevac airbus - a fully-equipped emergency flying hospital - based in cologne has been placed on alert .
the german parliament restricted the mandate to three months , a time frame lieutenant colonel katz is certain will not be prolonged .
" we are assuming that the mission will be over on september 1 . "
with such a short time frame and a limited field of operation , germany has intentionally placed restrictions on its contribution to the peacekeeping mission .
in the end it is not much more than a political signal of support to its neighbor france and the other eu members who are sending troops into the battlefield . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german troops to help restore peace in congo the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .

with the arrival of the first bundeswehr transport plane in uganda , the german military begins its limited peacekeeping mission as part of the eu contingent sent to maintain stability in strife-torn congo . the german military ’ s first transport plane touched down in entebbe , uganda , on friday , loaded with materials for the french-led eu troops deployed across the border in the northeastern region of congo .
the arrival of the transall cargo plane marks the start of a limited military mission , which was approved by german parliament two weeks ago .
the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said defense minister peter struck in justification for germany ’ s limited offer of transport and logistical help .
all totaled there are about 100 german soldiers participating in the peacekeeping mission , far fewer than the 350 originally called for in the mandate .
eight german officers are lending their support in the headquarters for the eu congo mission in paris , and one medevac airbus - a fully-equipped emergency flying hospital - based in cologne has been placed on alert .
the german parliament restricted the mandate to three months , a time frame lieutenant colonel katz is certain will not be prolonged .
" we are assuming that the mission will be over on september 1 . "
with such a short time frame and a limited field of operation , germany has intentionally placed restrictions on its contribution to the peacekeeping mission .

did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?
berlusconi said on friday he did not offer germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder an apology for a nazi slur he made in the eu parliament on wednesday . just as things looked like they were finally calming down , he ’ s done it again .
italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .
" yesterday i made no apology , " he said defiantly at a press conference in rome , which was initially intended to set the tone of the italian eu presidency for the next six months .
instead , the meeting was overshadowed by a diplomatic imbroglio of berlusconi ’ s own making .
the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "
neither chancellor schröder nor foreign minister joschka fischer would comment on berlusconi ’ s most recent statements .

the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "

did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?
berlusconi said on friday he did not offer germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder an apology for a nazi slur he made in the eu parliament on wednesday . just as things looked like they were finally calming down , he ’ s done it again .
italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .

most tourists go to berlin to see sights like the brandenburg gate or the reichstag building .
but there ’ s another side to the german capital that most visitors miss , even though it ’ s literally under their feet . there 's an unremarkable green door in the central berlin subway station .
hundreds of people pass by it every day .
few of them suspect that behind it lies an extensive network of underground rooms that literally breathe history .
behind the green door lies the passage to a world war ii era bunker .
the berlin underground association regularly puts on tours of this structure and others like it .
the group is dedicated to uncovering the secret treasures hidden under berlin ’ s city streets .
going back to the time of war once the people on the guided tour have gone through the green door , they go down a number of dark stairs and descend into a murky world that seems largely unchanged since the war days .
old lettering on the walls prohibits smoking , or communicates the room ’ s maximum occupancy .
some rooms have bunk beds , others just long narrow benches on the walls .
and it ’ s not hard to imagine frightened berliners huddling here as allied bombs rained down on the city above .
" everything you see is original , " explains michael foedrowitz , and points to the furniture and the technical equipment .
" everything here was built during world war ii " michael foedrowitz is a member of the berlin underground association and a specialist on bunkers .
" we collected all these things not only from this bunker but from other bunkers in berlin and from bunkers in west germany .
and then we started to put together an exhibition . "
life during the bombing raids visiting the bunker , tourists now get to see the underground clinic , complete with old medical supplies , and the bunker 's command center with air raid guidelines .
there are cracked dishes and cutlery , steel helmets , a child ’ s doll , and a hand-cranked ventilation system that still works .
it pulled in fresh air to the four thousand people who during air raids were packed liked sardines into this bunker designed for only a third of that number .
as the war raged in berlin , the nazis constructed gigantic subterranean airplane factories .
they also built the first foundations of a new berlin , the future nazi world capital of " germania . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate all that ’ s left now are two underground tunnels behind the brandenburg gate .
a city under ground but there ’ s much more than just bunkers lying buried in berlin ’ s sandy soil - there ’ s a whole catalogue of subterranean structures and systems .
and many of them were constructed long before the 20th century .
labyrinthine sewers and underground vaults were built in the 19th century along with a pneumatic tube system that reflected berlin ’ s growing industrial might .
" it was used to transport letters and postcards and secret mails , " explains michael foedrowitz .
" all the ministries were connected with this kind of communication system .
it was the most modern of its time . "
that same pneumatic tube system was used all the way up until the 1970 ’ s. continued on page 2 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's bunkers in party alarm berlin has 22 bunkers , which have all undergone thorough inspection after the new york attacks .

most tourists go to berlin to see sights like the brandenburg gate or the reichstag building .
but there ’ s another side to the german capital that most visitors miss , even though it ’ s literally under their feet . there 's an unremarkable green door in the central berlin subway station .
hundreds of people pass by it every day .
few of them suspect that behind it lies an extensive network of underground rooms that literally breathe history .
behind the green door lies the passage to a world war ii era bunker .
the berlin underground association regularly puts on tours of this structure and others like it .
the group is dedicated to uncovering the secret treasures hidden under berlin ’ s city streets .
going back to the time of war once the people on the guided tour have gone through the green door , they go down a number of dark stairs and descend into a murky world that seems largely unchanged since the war days .
old lettering on the walls prohibits smoking , or communicates the room ’ s maximum occupancy .
some rooms have bunk beds , others just long narrow benches on the walls .
and it ’ s not hard to imagine frightened berliners huddling here as allied bombs rained down on the city above .
" everything you see is original , " explains michael foedrowitz , and points to the furniture and the technical equipment .
" everything here was built during world war ii " michael foedrowitz is a member of the berlin underground association and a specialist on bunkers .
" we collected all these things not only from this bunker but from other bunkers in berlin and from bunkers in west germany .
and then we started to put together an exhibition . "
life during the bombing raids visiting the bunker , tourists now get to see the underground clinic , complete with old medical supplies , and the bunker 's command center with air raid guidelines .
there are cracked dishes and cutlery , steel helmets , a child ’ s doll , and a hand-cranked ventilation system that still works .
it pulled in fresh air to the four thousand people who during air raids were packed liked sardines into this bunker designed for only a third of that number .
as the war raged in berlin , the nazis constructed gigantic subterranean airplane factories .
they also built the first foundations of a new berlin , the future nazi world capital of " germania . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate all that ’ s left now are two underground tunnels behind the brandenburg gate .
a city under ground but there ’ s much more than just bunkers lying buried in berlin ’ s sandy soil - there ’ s a whole catalogue of subterranean structures and systems .
and many of them were constructed long before the 20th century .
labyrinthine sewers and underground vaults were built in the 19th century along with a pneumatic tube system that reflected berlin ’ s growing industrial might .
" it was used to transport letters and postcards and secret mails , " explains michael foedrowitz .
" all the ministries were connected with this kind of communication system .
it was the most modern of its time . "
that same pneumatic tube system was used all the way up until the 1970 ’ s. continued on page 2 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's bunkers in party alarm berlin has 22 bunkers , which have all undergone thorough inspection after the new york attacks .

and new tunnels were built , this time less officially , by people digging under the berlin wall or by american spies trying to intercept east germany ’ s messages to moscow .
ghosts in the subway and there are some twelve subway stations and tunnel sections that were built but never connected to the rest of the system for various reasons , usually financial .
these so-called " ghost stations " sit silently , their blind tunnels stretching out like a web under berlin ’ s skin , waiting for trains that never come .
a city hidden from view " berlin is sitting on a treasure it does n't even know about , " says dietmar arnold .
he 's the co-founder of the berlin underground association .
dietmar arnold thinks that many of these treasures are being destroyed .
" much too much is being torn out .
we founded the group to counter that .
it can be seen as a kind of lobby for berlin ’ s underground constructions and an attempt to save at least a part of this history . "
a history worth preserving ?
but it ’ s a history that makes some of german ’ s politicians uncomfortable , since it reminds them of the darkest period of the country ’ s past .
so when the organization located the personal bunkers of some of the nazi elite and appealed to the government to open them up , the authorities weren ’ t that enthusiastic .
" they are very keen to eliminate those buildings from world war ii or the nazi time , " says bunker-expert michael foedrowitz .
" it ’ s a pity because it means a destruction of a part of our history .
it ’ s not a good one , but anyway it ’ s a part of history . "
underground treasures to discover according to dietmar arnold of the berlin underground association , 40 percent of central berlin ’ s construction is to be found underground .
so there ’ s still a lot of history there .
" i think we ’ ve got plenty to do for the next five years , surely , if not longer , " says arnold .
" we ’ ll undertake expeditions and research more underground structures , document them and then make them available to the government " and to the public .
underground tourism besides the weekly tours of the bunkers , the association holds special excursions through former underground vaults , breweries , power plants , and even the sewers for the especially brave .
english-language tours can be set up for those who call ahead of time .
dietmar arnold finds he ’ s spending more and more time underground as his group keeps growing , along with demand for tours .
" but i hope i don ’ t look so pale that people think i actually live underground .
it ’ s not that bad yet . " kyle james , berlin back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's bunkers in party alarm berlin has 22 bunkers , which have all undergone thorough inspection after the new york attacks .

the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said defense minister peter struck in justification for germany ’ s limited offer of transport and logistical help .
all totaled there are about 100 german soldiers participating in the peacekeeping mission , far fewer than the 350 originally called for in the mandate .
eight german officers are lending their support in the headquarters for the eu congo mission in paris , and one medevac airbus - a fully-equipped emergency flying hospital - based in cologne has been placed on alert .
the german parliament restricted the mandate to three months , a time frame lieutenant colonel katz is certain will not be prolonged .
" we are assuming that the mission will be over on september 1 . "
with such a short time frame and a limited field of operation , germany has intentionally placed restrictions on its contribution to the peacekeeping mission .

with the arrival of the first bundeswehr transport plane in uganda , the german military begins its limited peacekeeping mission as part of the eu contingent sent to maintain stability in strife-torn congo . the german military ’ s first transport plane touched down in entebbe , uganda , on friday , loaded with materials for the french-led eu troops deployed across the border in the northeastern region of congo .
the arrival of the transall cargo plane marks the start of a limited military mission , which was approved by german parliament two weeks ago .
the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said defense minister peter struck in justification for germany ’ s limited offer of transport and logistical help .

did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?
berlusconi said on friday he did not offer germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder an apology for a nazi slur he made in the eu parliament on wednesday . just as things looked like they were finally calming down , he ’ s done it again .
italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .
" yesterday i made no apology , " he said defiantly at a press conference in rome , which was initially intended to set the tone of the italian eu presidency for the next six months .
instead , the meeting was overshadowed by a diplomatic imbroglio of berlusconi ’ s own making .
the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "
neither chancellor schröder nor foreign minister joschka fischer would comment on berlusconi ’ s most recent statements .
for them , anda said , the issue is resolved .
" i hope very much that there is someone in close contact with the italian prime minister , who can give him good advice , " anda concluded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi expresses regret over nazi gibe in a heated diplomatic row , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has apologized to the german chancellor following remarks comparing a german politician to a concentration camp guard -lrb- july 3 , 2007 -rrb- .

at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues . only two weeks after its presentation at an eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , the debate over provisions in the draft european constitution has broken out again in brussels .
before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .
the german government 's " corrections " are among them .
leading the list of changes berlin wants implemented is language that would permit decisions on immigration and asylum policy to be made by a qualified majority decision in brussels .
on friday , foreign minister joschka fischer repeated his government 's demand that it be permitted to retain veto power on such decisions .
" the question of immigration policy remains a particularly sensitive domestic issue " for germany , fischer told the convention .
he said the majority rules provision in the constitution was unacceptable to the german government .
before eu countries can rule on immigration policies by majority vote , he said , they must first agree to common foundations for immigration .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , interior minister otto schilly and the opposition christian democratic union have all rejected eu majority decisions on immigration policy .
germany 's resistance has been fueled by its own domestic paralysis over the issue .
the country 's first-ever immigration bill was recently rejected in the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber , and the government and opposition parties are still seeking a compromise .
support for majority votes on some policies but in a number of other areas , germany has championed the use of the qualified majority voting in decision-making , including the areas of foreign and security policy .
on friday , germany called for foundations to be laid in the constitution for eu justice and domestic policies that would allow for the creation of a european border police and a european prosecutor .
the convention presidency has said it wants to retain veto power in the constitution for tax policy – especially indirect taxes that are necessary for the development of the internal market .
britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .
the draft was greeted unanimously by eu leaders , and the final text of the document is to be hammered out at an intergovernmental conference slated to convene in october .

did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?
berlusconi said on friday he did not offer germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder an apology for a nazi slur he made in the eu parliament on wednesday . just as things looked like they were finally calming down , he ’ s done it again .
italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .
" yesterday i made no apology , " he said defiantly at a press conference in rome , which was initially intended to set the tone of the italian eu presidency for the next six months .
instead , the meeting was overshadowed by a diplomatic imbroglio of berlusconi ’ s own making .
the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "
neither chancellor schröder nor foreign minister joschka fischer would comment on berlusconi ’ s most recent statements .
for them , anda said , the issue is resolved .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 05.07.2003 germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is calling for a few " corrections " to the eu 's draft constitution .
at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues . only two weeks after its presentation at an eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , the debate over provisions in the draft european constitution has broken out again in brussels .
before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .
the german government 's " corrections " are among them .
leading the list of changes berlin wants implemented is language that would permit decisions on immigration and asylum policy to be made by a qualified majority decision in brussels .
on friday , foreign minister joschka fischer repeated his government 's demand that it be permitted to retain veto power on such decisions .
" the question of immigration policy remains a particularly sensitive domestic issue " for germany , fischer told the convention .
he said the majority rules provision in the constitution was unacceptable to the german government .
before eu countries can rule on immigration policies by majority vote , he said , they must first agree to common foundations for immigration .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , interior minister otto schilly and the opposition christian democratic union have all rejected eu majority decisions on immigration policy .
germany 's resistance has been fueled by its own domestic paralysis over the issue .
the country 's first-ever immigration bill was recently rejected in the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber , and the government and opposition parties are still seeking a compromise .
support for majority votes on some policies but in a number of other areas , germany has championed the use of the qualified majority voting in decision-making , including the areas of foreign and security policy .
on friday , germany called for foundations to be laid in the constitution for eu justice and domestic policies that would allow for the creation of a european border police and a european prosecutor .
the convention presidency has said it wants to retain veto power in the constitution for tax policy – especially indirect taxes that are necessary for the development of the internal market .
britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .
the draft was greeted unanimously by eu leaders , and the final text of the document is to be hammered out at an intergovernmental conference slated to convene in october .

at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .
authorities are saying it 's the work of chechen terrorists . several explosions , detonated by two female suicide bombers , went off during a heavily-visited outdoor rock festival on the outskirts of moscow on saturday , killing at least 18 and seriously injuring many more , russian police sources were quoted as telling the interfax news agency .
police and officials from the russian interior ministry reportedly said terror attacks were the cause of the explosions .
police spokeswoman valery gribakin told the agency that two suspicious-looking woman had been detained at the entrance to the festival , and upon being questioned detonated bombs they were wearing .
after the first blast went off at 2:39 local time -lrb- 10:52 gmt -rrb- it was followed up by a second . there are also reports that a third bomb exploded at a nearby market , security services told russian news agencies .
police investigating the attack told the russian news agency itar-tass that the two women had strapped 500 grams -lrb- 18 ounces -rrb- of dynamite around themselves .

the organizers for the popular rock festival , which was put on by a local radio station at the city 's airfield , said some 20,000 people were at the day-long event .
a terrorist attack ?
the exact reason behind the suicide attack is still uncertain , and so far there has been no claim of responsibility .
but the russian state prosecutor 's office has launched an immediate investigation into " terrorism " interfax said .
interior minister boris gryzlov has pinpointed chechen separatists , who are fighting to sever their mainly muslim region from the rest of russia .
" today -lsb- saturday -rsb- president putin signed a decree on elections in chechnya , and one can think that these attacks are linked to this event , " he told journalists gathered at the scene of the blasts .
the decree , which is part of vladimir putin 's controversial peace plan for the war-torn state in the caucasus mountains , calls for kremlin-run local presidential elections in chechnya on october .
putin launched the plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but guerrillas , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected putin 's peace plan and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2003 german troops begin congo mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transall cargo planes will be heading for uganda as part of its congo peacekeeping mission .
with the arrival of the first bundeswehr transport plane in uganda , the german military begins its limited peacekeeping mission as part of the eu contingent sent to maintain stability in strife-torn congo . the german military ’ s first transport plane touched down in entebbe , uganda , on friday , loaded with materials for the french-led eu troops deployed across the border in the northeastern region of congo .
the arrival of the transall cargo plane marks the start of a limited military mission , which was approved by german parliament two weeks ago .
the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said defense minister peter struck in justification for germany ’ s limited offer of transport and logistical help .
all totaled there are about 100 german soldiers participating in the peacekeeping mission , far fewer than the 350 originally called for in the mandate .
eight german officers are lending their support in the headquarters for the eu congo mission in paris , and one medevac airbus - a fully-equipped emergency flying hospital - based in cologne has been placed on alert .
the german parliament restricted the mandate to three months , a time frame lieutenant colonel katz is certain will not be prolonged .
" we are assuming that the mission will be over on september 1 . "
with such a short time frame and a limited field of operation , germany has intentionally placed restrictions on its contribution to the peacekeeping mission .
in the end it is not much more than a political signal of support to its neighbor france and the other eu members who are sending troops into the battlefield . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german troops to help restore peace in congo the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 05.07.2003 germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is calling for a few " corrections " to the eu 's draft constitution .
at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues . only two weeks after its presentation at an eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , the debate over provisions in the draft european constitution has broken out again in brussels .
before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .
the german government 's " corrections " are among them .
leading the list of changes berlin wants implemented is language that would permit decisions on immigration and asylum policy to be made by a qualified majority decision in brussels .
on friday , foreign minister joschka fischer repeated his government 's demand that it be permitted to retain veto power on such decisions .
" the question of immigration policy remains a particularly sensitive domestic issue " for germany , fischer told the convention .
he said the majority rules provision in the constitution was unacceptable to the german government .
before eu countries can rule on immigration policies by majority vote , he said , they must first agree to common foundations for immigration .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , interior minister otto schilly and the opposition christian democratic union have all rejected eu majority decisions on immigration policy .
germany 's resistance has been fueled by its own domestic paralysis over the issue .
the country 's first-ever immigration bill was recently rejected in the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber , and the government and opposition parties are still seeking a compromise .
support for majority votes on some policies but in a number of other areas , germany has championed the use of the qualified majority voting in decision-making , including the areas of foreign and security policy .
on friday , germany called for foundations to be laid in the constitution for eu justice and domestic policies that would allow for the creation of a european border police and a european prosecutor .
the convention presidency has said it wants to retain veto power in the constitution for tax policy – especially indirect taxes that are necessary for the development of the internal market .
britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .
the draft was greeted unanimously by eu leaders , and the final text of the document is to be hammered out at an intergovernmental conference slated to convene in october .

did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?
berlusconi said on friday he did not offer germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder an apology for a nazi slur he made in the eu parliament on wednesday . just as things looked like they were finally calming down , he ’ s done it again .
italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .
" yesterday i made no apology , " he said defiantly at a press conference in rome , which was initially intended to set the tone of the italian eu presidency for the next six months .
instead , the meeting was overshadowed by a diplomatic imbroglio of berlusconi ’ s own making .
the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "
neither chancellor schröder nor foreign minister joschka fischer would comment on berlusconi ’ s most recent statements .
for them , anda said , the issue is resolved .
" i hope very much that there is someone in close contact with the italian prime minister , who can give him good advice , " anda concluded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi expresses regret over nazi gibe in a heated diplomatic row , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has apologized to the german chancellor following remarks comparing a german politician to a concentration camp guard -lrb- july 3 , 2007 -rrb- .

did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?
berlusconi said on friday he did not offer germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder an apology for a nazi slur he made in the eu parliament on wednesday . just as things looked like they were finally calming down , he ’ s done it again .
italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .
" yesterday i made no apology , " he said defiantly at a press conference in rome , which was initially intended to set the tone of the italian eu presidency for the next six months .
instead , the meeting was overshadowed by a diplomatic imbroglio of berlusconi ’ s own making .
the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "
neither chancellor schröder nor foreign minister joschka fischer would comment on berlusconi ’ s most recent statements .
for them , anda said , the issue is resolved .

police spokeswoman valery gribakin told the agency that two suspicious-looking woman had been detained at the entrance to the festival , and upon being questioned detonated bombs they were wearing .

" today -lsb- saturday -rsb- president putin signed a decree on elections in chechnya , and one can think that these attacks are linked to this event , " he told journalists gathered at the scene of the blasts .
the decree , which is part of vladimir putin 's controversial peace plan for the war-torn state in the caucasus mountains , calls for kremlin-run local presidential elections in chechnya on october .
putin launched the plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but guerrillas , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected putin 's peace plan and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2003 german troops begin congo mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transall cargo planes will be heading for uganda as part of its congo peacekeeping mission .
with the arrival of the first bundeswehr transport plane in uganda , the german military begins its limited peacekeeping mission as part of the eu contingent sent to maintain stability in strife-torn congo . the german military ’ s first transport plane touched down in entebbe , uganda , on friday , loaded with materials for the french-led eu troops deployed across the border in the northeastern region of congo .
the arrival of the transall cargo plane marks the start of a limited military mission , which was approved by german parliament two weeks ago .
the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .

did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?
berlusconi said on friday he did not offer germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder an apology for a nazi slur he made in the eu parliament on wednesday . just as things looked like they were finally calming down , he ’ s done it again .
italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .
" yesterday i made no apology , " he said defiantly at a press conference in rome , which was initially intended to set the tone of the italian eu presidency for the next six months .
instead , the meeting was overshadowed by a diplomatic imbroglio of berlusconi ’ s own making .
the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "
neither chancellor schröder nor foreign minister joschka fischer would comment on berlusconi ’ s most recent statements .
for them , anda said , the issue is resolved .
" i hope very much that there is someone in close contact with the italian prime minister , who can give him good advice , " anda concluded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi expresses regret over nazi gibe in a heated diplomatic row , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has apologized to the german chancellor following remarks comparing a german politician to a concentration camp guard -lrb- july 3 , 2007 -rrb- .

with the arrival of the first bundeswehr transport plane in uganda , the german military begins its limited peacekeeping mission as part of the eu contingent sent to maintain stability in strife-torn congo . the german military ’ s first transport plane touched down in entebbe , uganda , on friday , loaded with materials for the french-led eu troops deployed across the border in the northeastern region of congo .
the arrival of the transall cargo plane marks the start of a limited military mission , which was approved by german parliament two weeks ago .
the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said defense minister peter struck in justification for germany ’ s limited offer of transport and logistical help .

bunkers got new life as warehouses , storing food for the west berlin population during the soviet blockade .
and new tunnels were built , this time less officially , by people digging under the berlin wall or by american spies trying to intercept east germany ’ s messages to moscow .
ghosts in the subway and there are some twelve subway stations and tunnel sections that were built but never connected to the rest of the system for various reasons , usually financial .
these so-called " ghost stations " sit silently , their blind tunnels stretching out like a web under berlin ’ s skin , waiting for trains that never come .
a city hidden from view " berlin is sitting on a treasure it does n't even know about , " says dietmar arnold .
he 's the co-founder of the berlin underground association .
dietmar arnold thinks that many of these treasures are being destroyed .
" much too much is being torn out .
we founded the group to counter that .
it can be seen as a kind of lobby for berlin ’ s underground constructions and an attempt to save at least a part of this history . "
a history worth preserving ?
but it ’ s a history that makes some of german ’ s politicians uncomfortable , since it reminds them of the darkest period of the country ’ s past .
so when the organization located the personal bunkers of some of the nazi elite and appealed to the government to open them up , the authorities weren ’ t that enthusiastic .
" they are very keen to eliminate those buildings from world war ii or the nazi time , " says bunker-expert michael foedrowitz .
" it ’ s a pity because it means a destruction of a part of our history .
it ’ s not a good one , but anyway it ’ s a part of history . "
underground treasures to discover according to dietmar arnold of the berlin underground association , 40 percent of central berlin ’ s construction is to be found underground .
so there ’ s still a lot of history there .
" i think we ’ ve got plenty to do for the next five years , surely , if not longer , " says arnold .
" we ’ ll undertake expeditions and research more underground structures , document them and then make them available to the government " and to the public .
underground tourism besides the weekly tours of the bunkers , the association holds special excursions through former underground vaults , breweries , power plants , and even the sewers for the especially brave .
english-language tours can be set up for those who call ahead of time .
dietmar arnold finds he ’ s spending more and more time underground as his group keeps growing , along with demand for tours .

bunkers got new life as warehouses , storing food for the west berlin population during the soviet blockade .
and new tunnels were built , this time less officially , by people digging under the berlin wall or by american spies trying to intercept east germany ’ s messages to moscow .
ghosts in the subway and there are some twelve subway stations and tunnel sections that were built but never connected to the rest of the system for various reasons , usually financial .
these so-called " ghost stations " sit silently , their blind tunnels stretching out like a web under berlin ’ s skin , waiting for trains that never come .
a city hidden from view " berlin is sitting on a treasure it does n't even know about , " says dietmar arnold .
he 's the co-founder of the berlin underground association .
dietmar arnold thinks that many of these treasures are being destroyed .
" much too much is being torn out .
we founded the group to counter that .
it can be seen as a kind of lobby for berlin ’ s underground constructions and an attempt to save at least a part of this history . "
a history worth preserving ?
but it ’ s a history that makes some of german ’ s politicians uncomfortable , since it reminds them of the darkest period of the country ’ s past .
so when the organization located the personal bunkers of some of the nazi elite and appealed to the government to open them up , the authorities weren ’ t that enthusiastic .
" they are very keen to eliminate those buildings from world war ii or the nazi time , " says bunker-expert michael foedrowitz .
" it ’ s a pity because it means a destruction of a part of our history .
it ’ s not a good one , but anyway it ’ s a part of history . "
underground treasures to discover according to dietmar arnold of the berlin underground association , 40 percent of central berlin ’ s construction is to be found underground .
so there ’ s still a lot of history there .
" i think we ’ ve got plenty to do for the next five years , surely , if not longer , " says arnold .
" we ’ ll undertake expeditions and research more underground structures , document them and then make them available to the government " and to the public .
underground tourism besides the weekly tours of the bunkers , the association holds special excursions through former underground vaults , breweries , power plants , and even the sewers for the especially brave .
english-language tours can be set up for those who call ahead of time .
dietmar arnold finds he ’ s spending more and more time underground as his group keeps growing , along with demand for tours .

at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues . only two weeks after its presentation at an eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , the debate over provisions in the draft european constitution has broken out again in brussels .
before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .
the german government 's " corrections " are among them .
leading the list of changes berlin wants implemented is language that would permit decisions on immigration and asylum policy to be made by a qualified majority decision in brussels .
on friday , foreign minister joschka fischer repeated his government 's demand that it be permitted to retain veto power on such decisions .
" the question of immigration policy remains a particularly sensitive domestic issue " for germany , fischer told the convention .
he said the majority rules provision in the constitution was unacceptable to the german government .
before eu countries can rule on immigration policies by majority vote , he said , they must first agree to common foundations for immigration .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , interior minister otto schilly and the opposition christian democratic union have all rejected eu majority decisions on immigration policy .
germany 's resistance has been fueled by its own domestic paralysis over the issue .
the country 's first-ever immigration bill was recently rejected in the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber , and the government and opposition parties are still seeking a compromise .
support for majority votes on some policies but in a number of other areas , germany has championed the use of the qualified majority voting in decision-making , including the areas of foreign and security policy .
on friday , germany called for foundations to be laid in the constitution for eu justice and domestic policies that would allow for the creation of a european border police and a european prosecutor .
the convention presidency has said it wants to retain veto power in the constitution for tax policy – especially indirect taxes that are necessary for the development of the internal market .
britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 05.07.2003 germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is calling for a few " corrections " to the eu 's draft constitution .
at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues . only two weeks after its presentation at an eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , the debate over provisions in the draft european constitution has broken out again in brussels .
before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .
the german government 's " corrections " are among them .
leading the list of changes berlin wants implemented is language that would permit decisions on immigration and asylum policy to be made by a qualified majority decision in brussels .
on friday , foreign minister joschka fischer repeated his government 's demand that it be permitted to retain veto power on such decisions .
" the question of immigration policy remains a particularly sensitive domestic issue " for germany , fischer told the convention .
he said the majority rules provision in the constitution was unacceptable to the german government .
before eu countries can rule on immigration policies by majority vote , he said , they must first agree to common foundations for immigration .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , interior minister otto schilly and the opposition christian democratic union have all rejected eu majority decisions on immigration policy .
germany 's resistance has been fueled by its own domestic paralysis over the issue .
the country 's first-ever immigration bill was recently rejected in the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber , and the government and opposition parties are still seeking a compromise .
support for majority votes on some policies but in a number of other areas , germany has championed the use of the qualified majority voting in decision-making , including the areas of foreign and security policy .
on friday , germany called for foundations to be laid in the constitution for eu justice and domestic policies that would allow for the creation of a european border police and a european prosecutor .
the convention presidency has said it wants to retain veto power in the constitution for tax policy – especially indirect taxes that are necessary for the development of the internal market .
britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .
the draft was greeted unanimously by eu leaders , and the final text of the document is to be hammered out at an intergovernmental conference slated to convene in october .

police and officials from the russian interior ministry reportedly said terror attacks were the cause of the explosions .
police spokeswoman valery gribakin told the agency that two suspicious-looking woman had been detained at the entrance to the festival , and upon being questioned detonated bombs they were wearing .
after the first blast went off at 2:39 local time -lrb- 10:52 gmt -rrb- it was followed up by a second . there are also reports that a third bomb exploded at a nearby market , security services told russian news agencies .

a terrorist attack ?
the exact reason behind the suicide attack is still uncertain , and so far there has been no claim of responsibility .
but the russian state prosecutor 's office has launched an immediate investigation into " terrorism " interfax said .
interior minister boris gryzlov has pinpointed chechen separatists , who are fighting to sever their mainly muslim region from the rest of russia .
" today -lsb- saturday -rsb- president putin signed a decree on elections in chechnya , and one can think that these attacks are linked to this event , " he told journalists gathered at the scene of the blasts .
the decree , which is part of vladimir putin 's controversial peace plan for the war-torn state in the caucasus mountains , calls for kremlin-run local presidential elections in chechnya on october .
putin launched the plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but guerrillas , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected putin 's peace plan and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military .

did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?
berlusconi said on friday he did not offer germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder an apology for a nazi slur he made in the eu parliament on wednesday . just as things looked like they were finally calming down , he ’ s done it again .
italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .
" yesterday i made no apology , " he said defiantly at a press conference in rome , which was initially intended to set the tone of the italian eu presidency for the next six months .
instead , the meeting was overshadowed by a diplomatic imbroglio of berlusconi ’ s own making .
the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "
neither chancellor schröder nor foreign minister joschka fischer would comment on berlusconi ’ s most recent statements .
for them , anda said , the issue is resolved .

did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?
berlusconi said on friday he did not offer germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder an apology for a nazi slur he made in the eu parliament on wednesday . just as things looked like they were finally calming down , he ’ s done it again .
italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .
" yesterday i made no apology , " he said defiantly at a press conference in rome , which was initially intended to set the tone of the italian eu presidency for the next six months .
instead , the meeting was overshadowed by a diplomatic imbroglio of berlusconi ’ s own making .
the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "
neither chancellor schröder nor foreign minister joschka fischer would comment on berlusconi ’ s most recent statements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.07.2003 german troops begin congo mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german transall cargo planes will be heading for uganda as part of its congo peacekeeping mission .
with the arrival of the first bundeswehr transport plane in uganda , the german military begins its limited peacekeeping mission as part of the eu contingent sent to maintain stability in strife-torn congo . the german military ’ s first transport plane touched down in entebbe , uganda , on friday , loaded with materials for the french-led eu troops deployed across the border in the northeastern region of congo .
the arrival of the transall cargo plane marks the start of a limited military mission , which was approved by german parliament two weeks ago .
the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said defense minister peter struck in justification for germany ’ s limited offer of transport and logistical help .
all totaled there are about 100 german soldiers participating in the peacekeeping mission , far fewer than the 350 originally called for in the mandate .
eight german officers are lending their support in the headquarters for the eu congo mission in paris , and one medevac airbus - a fully-equipped emergency flying hospital - based in cologne has been placed on alert .
the german parliament restricted the mandate to three months , a time frame lieutenant colonel katz is certain will not be prolonged .
" we are assuming that the mission will be over on september 1 . "
with such a short time frame and a limited field of operation , germany has intentionally placed restrictions on its contribution to the peacekeeping mission .
in the end it is not much more than a political signal of support to its neighbor france and the other eu members who are sending troops into the battlefield . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german troops to help restore peace in congo the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .

with the arrival of the first bundeswehr transport plane in uganda , the german military begins its limited peacekeeping mission as part of the eu contingent sent to maintain stability in strife-torn congo . the german military ’ s first transport plane touched down in entebbe , uganda , on friday , loaded with materials for the french-led eu troops deployed across the border in the northeastern region of congo .
the arrival of the transall cargo plane marks the start of a limited military mission , which was approved by german parliament two weeks ago .
the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said defense minister peter struck in justification for germany ’ s limited offer of transport and logistical help .
all totaled there are about 100 german soldiers participating in the peacekeeping mission , far fewer than the 350 originally called for in the mandate .
eight german officers are lending their support in the headquarters for the eu congo mission in paris , and one medevac airbus - a fully-equipped emergency flying hospital - based in cologne has been placed on alert .
the german parliament restricted the mandate to three months , a time frame lieutenant colonel katz is certain will not be prolonged .
" we are assuming that the mission will be over on september 1 . "
with such a short time frame and a limited field of operation , germany has intentionally placed restrictions on its contribution to the peacekeeping mission .
in the end it is not much more than a political signal of support to its neighbor france and the other eu members who are sending troops into the battlefield . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german troops to help restore peace in congo the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .

with the arrival of the first bundeswehr transport plane in uganda , the german military begins its limited peacekeeping mission as part of the eu contingent sent to maintain stability in strife-torn congo . the german military ’ s first transport plane touched down in entebbe , uganda , on friday , loaded with materials for the french-led eu troops deployed across the border in the northeastern region of congo .
the arrival of the transall cargo plane marks the start of a limited military mission , which was approved by german parliament two weeks ago .
the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 05.07.2003 germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is calling for a few " corrections " to the eu 's draft constitution .
at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues . only two weeks after its presentation at an eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , the debate over provisions in the draft european constitution has broken out again in brussels .
before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .
the german government 's " corrections " are among them .
leading the list of changes berlin wants implemented is language that would permit decisions on immigration and asylum policy to be made by a qualified majority decision in brussels .
on friday , foreign minister joschka fischer repeated his government 's demand that it be permitted to retain veto power on such decisions .
" the question of immigration policy remains a particularly sensitive domestic issue " for germany , fischer told the convention .
he said the majority rules provision in the constitution was unacceptable to the german government .
before eu countries can rule on immigration policies by majority vote , he said , they must first agree to common foundations for immigration .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , interior minister otto schilly and the opposition christian democratic union have all rejected eu majority decisions on immigration policy .
germany 's resistance has been fueled by its own domestic paralysis over the issue .
the country 's first-ever immigration bill was recently rejected in the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber , and the government and opposition parties are still seeking a compromise .
support for majority votes on some policies but in a number of other areas , germany has championed the use of the qualified majority voting in decision-making , including the areas of foreign and security policy .
on friday , germany called for foundations to be laid in the constitution for eu justice and domestic policies that would allow for the creation of a european border police and a european prosecutor .
the convention presidency has said it wants to retain veto power in the constitution for tax policy – especially indirect taxes that are necessary for the development of the internal market .
britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .
the draft was greeted unanimously by eu leaders , and the final text of the document is to be hammered out at an intergovernmental conference slated to convene in october .

the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said defense minister peter struck in justification for germany ’ s limited offer of transport and logistical help .
all totaled there are about 100 german soldiers participating in the peacekeeping mission , far fewer than the 350 originally called for in the mandate .
eight german officers are lending their support in the headquarters for the eu congo mission in paris , and one medevac airbus - a fully-equipped emergency flying hospital - based in cologne has been placed on alert .
the german parliament restricted the mandate to three months , a time frame lieutenant colonel katz is certain will not be prolonged .
" we are assuming that the mission will be over on september 1 . "
with such a short time frame and a limited field of operation , germany has intentionally placed restrictions on its contribution to the peacekeeping mission .
in the end it is not much more than a political signal of support to its neighbor france and the other eu members who are sending troops into the battlefield . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german troops to help restore peace in congo the german parliament agreed wednesday to send a limited number of troops to aid in peacekeeping efforts in the congo .

at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .
authorities are saying it 's the work of chechen terrorists . several explosions , detonated by two female suicide bombers , went off during a heavily-visited outdoor rock festival on the outskirts of moscow on saturday , killing at least 18 and seriously injuring many more , russian police sources were quoted as telling the interfax news agency .
police and officials from the russian interior ministry reportedly said terror attacks were the cause of the explosions .
police spokeswoman valery gribakin told the agency that two suspicious-looking woman had been detained at the entrance to the festival , and upon being questioned detonated bombs they were wearing .
after the first blast went off at 2:39 local time -lrb- 10:52 gmt -rrb- it was followed up by a second . there are also reports that a third bomb exploded at a nearby market , security services told russian news agencies .
police investigating the attack told the russian news agency itar-tass that the two women had strapped 500 grams -lrb- 18 ounces -rrb- of dynamite around themselves .

the organizers for the popular rock festival , which was put on by a local radio station at the city 's airfield , said some 20,000 people were at the day-long event .
a terrorist attack ?
the exact reason behind the suicide attack is still uncertain , and so far there has been no claim of responsibility .
but the russian state prosecutor 's office has launched an immediate investigation into " terrorism " interfax said .
interior minister boris gryzlov has pinpointed chechen separatists , who are fighting to sever their mainly muslim region from the rest of russia .
" today -lsb- saturday -rsb- president putin signed a decree on elections in chechnya , and one can think that these attacks are linked to this event , " he told journalists gathered at the scene of the blasts .
the decree , which is part of vladimir putin 's controversial peace plan for the war-torn state in the caucasus mountains , calls for kremlin-run local presidential elections in chechnya on october .
putin launched the plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but guerrillas , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected putin 's peace plan and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military .

most tourists go to berlin to see sights like the brandenburg gate or the reichstag building .
but there ’ s another side to the german capital that most visitors miss , even though it ’ s literally under their feet . there 's an unremarkable green door in the central berlin subway station .
hundreds of people pass by it every day .
few of them suspect that behind it lies an extensive network of underground rooms that literally breathe history .
behind the green door lies the passage to a world war ii era bunker .
the berlin underground association regularly puts on tours of this structure and others like it .
the group is dedicated to uncovering the secret treasures hidden under berlin ’ s city streets .
going back to the time of war once the people on the guided tour have gone through the green door , they go down a number of dark stairs and descend into a murky world that seems largely unchanged since the war days .
old lettering on the walls prohibits smoking , or communicates the room ’ s maximum occupancy .
some rooms have bunk beds , others just long narrow benches on the walls .
and it ’ s not hard to imagine frightened berliners huddling here as allied bombs rained down on the city above .
" everything you see is original , " explains michael foedrowitz , and points to the furniture and the technical equipment .
" everything here was built during world war ii " michael foedrowitz is a member of the berlin underground association and a specialist on bunkers .
" we collected all these things not only from this bunker but from other bunkers in berlin and from bunkers in west germany .
and then we started to put together an exhibition . "
life during the bombing raids visiting the bunker , tourists now get to see the underground clinic , complete with old medical supplies , and the bunker 's command center with air raid guidelines .
there are cracked dishes and cutlery , steel helmets , a child ’ s doll , and a hand-cranked ventilation system that still works .
it pulled in fresh air to the four thousand people who during air raids were packed liked sardines into this bunker designed for only a third of that number .
as the war raged in berlin , the nazis constructed gigantic subterranean airplane factories .
they also built the first foundations of a new berlin , the future nazi world capital of " germania . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brandenburg gate all that ’ s left now are two underground tunnels behind the brandenburg gate .
a city under ground but there ’ s much more than just bunkers lying buried in berlin ’ s sandy soil - there ’ s a whole catalogue of subterranean structures and systems .
and many of them were constructed long before the 20th century .
labyrinthine sewers and underground vaults were built in the 19th century along with a pneumatic tube system that reflected berlin ’ s growing industrial might .
" it was used to transport letters and postcards and secret mails , " explains michael foedrowitz .
" all the ministries were connected with this kind of communication system .
it was the most modern of its time . "
that same pneumatic tube system was used all the way up until the 1970 ’ s. continued on page 2 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's bunkers in party alarm berlin has 22 bunkers , which have all undergone thorough inspection after the new york attacks .

bunkers got new life as warehouses , storing food for the west berlin population during the soviet blockade .
and new tunnels were built , this time less officially , by people digging under the berlin wall or by american spies trying to intercept east germany ’ s messages to moscow .
ghosts in the subway and there are some twelve subway stations and tunnel sections that were built but never connected to the rest of the system for various reasons , usually financial .
these so-called " ghost stations " sit silently , their blind tunnels stretching out like a web under berlin ’ s skin , waiting for trains that never come .
a city hidden from view " berlin is sitting on a treasure it does n't even know about , " says dietmar arnold .
he 's the co-founder of the berlin underground association .
dietmar arnold thinks that many of these treasures are being destroyed .
" much too much is being torn out .
we founded the group to counter that .
it can be seen as a kind of lobby for berlin ’ s underground constructions and an attempt to save at least a part of this history . "
a history worth preserving ?
but it ’ s a history that makes some of german ’ s politicians uncomfortable , since it reminds them of the darkest period of the country ’ s past .
so when the organization located the personal bunkers of some of the nazi elite and appealed to the government to open them up , the authorities weren ’ t that enthusiastic .
" they are very keen to eliminate those buildings from world war ii or the nazi time , " says bunker-expert michael foedrowitz .
" it ’ s a pity because it means a destruction of a part of our history .
it ’ s not a good one , but anyway it ’ s a part of history . "
underground treasures to discover according to dietmar arnold of the berlin underground association , 40 percent of central berlin ’ s construction is to be found underground .
so there ’ s still a lot of history there .
" i think we ’ ve got plenty to do for the next five years , surely , if not longer , " says arnold .
" we ’ ll undertake expeditions and research more underground structures , document them and then make them available to the government " and to the public .
underground tourism besides the weekly tours of the bunkers , the association holds special excursions through former underground vaults , breweries , power plants , and even the sewers for the especially brave .
english-language tours can be set up for those who call ahead of time .
dietmar arnold finds he ’ s spending more and more time underground as his group keeps growing , along with demand for tours .
" but i hope i don ’ t look so pale that people think i actually live underground .
it ’ s not that bad yet . " kyle james , berlin back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's bunkers in party alarm berlin has 22 bunkers , which have all undergone thorough inspection after the new york attacks .

most tourists go to berlin to see sights like the brandenburg gate or the reichstag building .
but there ’ s another side to the german capital that most visitors miss , even though it ’ s literally under their feet . there 's an unremarkable green door in the central berlin subway station .
hundreds of people pass by it every day .
few of them suspect that behind it lies an extensive network of underground rooms that literally breathe history .
behind the green door lies the passage to a world war ii era bunker .
the berlin underground association regularly puts on tours of this structure and others like it .
the group is dedicated to uncovering the secret treasures hidden under berlin ’ s city streets .
going back to the time of war once the people on the guided tour have gone through the green door , they go down a number of dark stairs and descend into a murky world that seems largely unchanged since the war days .
old lettering on the walls prohibits smoking , or communicates the room ’ s maximum occupancy .
some rooms have bunk beds , others just long narrow benches on the walls .
and it ’ s not hard to imagine frightened berliners huddling here as allied bombs rained down on the city above .
" everything you see is original , " explains michael foedrowitz , and points to the furniture and the technical equipment .
" everything here was built during world war ii " michael foedrowitz is a member of the berlin underground association and a specialist on bunkers .
" we collected all these things not only from this bunker but from other bunkers in berlin and from bunkers in west germany .
and then we started to put together an exhibition . "
life during the bombing raids visiting the bunker , tourists now get to see the underground clinic , complete with old medical supplies , and the bunker 's command center with air raid guidelines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 05.07.2003 germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is calling for a few " corrections " to the eu 's draft constitution .
at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues . only two weeks after its presentation at an eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , the debate over provisions in the draft european constitution has broken out again in brussels .
before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .
the german government 's " corrections " are among them .
leading the list of changes berlin wants implemented is language that would permit decisions on immigration and asylum policy to be made by a qualified majority decision in brussels .
on friday , foreign minister joschka fischer repeated his government 's demand that it be permitted to retain veto power on such decisions .
" the question of immigration policy remains a particularly sensitive domestic issue " for germany , fischer told the convention .
he said the majority rules provision in the constitution was unacceptable to the german government .
before eu countries can rule on immigration policies by majority vote , he said , they must first agree to common foundations for immigration .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , interior minister otto schilly and the opposition christian democratic union have all rejected eu majority decisions on immigration policy .
germany 's resistance has been fueled by its own domestic paralysis over the issue .
the country 's first-ever immigration bill was recently rejected in the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber , and the government and opposition parties are still seeking a compromise .
support for majority votes on some policies but in a number of other areas , germany has championed the use of the qualified majority voting in decision-making , including the areas of foreign and security policy .
on friday , germany called for foundations to be laid in the constitution for eu justice and domestic policies that would allow for the creation of a european border police and a european prosecutor .
the convention presidency has said it wants to retain veto power in the constitution for tax policy – especially indirect taxes that are necessary for the development of the internal market .
britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .
the draft was greeted unanimously by eu leaders , and the final text of the document is to be hammered out at an intergovernmental conference slated to convene in october .

at least 20 people were killed and dozens more injured in a suicide bombing saturday during a heavily-visited rock concert in moscow .
authorities are saying it 's the work of chechen terrorists . several explosions , detonated by two female suicide bombers , went off during a heavily-visited outdoor rock festival on the outskirts of moscow on saturday , killing at least 18 and seriously injuring many more , russian police sources were quoted as telling the interfax news agency .
police and officials from the russian interior ministry reportedly said terror attacks were the cause of the explosions .
police spokeswoman valery gribakin told the agency that two suspicious-looking woman had been detained at the entrance to the festival , and upon being questioned detonated bombs they were wearing .
after the first blast went off at 2:39 local time -lrb- 10:52 gmt -rrb- it was followed up by a second . there are also reports that a third bomb exploded at a nearby market , security services told russian news agencies .
police investigating the attack told the russian news agency itar-tass that the two women had strapped 500 grams -lrb- 18 ounces -rrb- of dynamite around themselves .

23 , 2002 .
the organizers for the popular rock festival , which was put on by a local radio station at the city 's airfield , said some 20,000 people were at the day-long event .
a terrorist attack ?
the exact reason behind the suicide attack is still uncertain , and so far there has been no claim of responsibility .
but the russian state prosecutor 's office has launched an immediate investigation into " terrorism " interfax said .
interior minister boris gryzlov has pinpointed chechen separatists , who are fighting to sever their mainly muslim region from the rest of russia .
" today -lsb- saturday -rsb- president putin signed a decree on elections in chechnya , and one can think that these attacks are linked to this event , " he told journalists gathered at the scene of the blasts .
the decree , which is part of vladimir putin 's controversial peace plan for the war-torn state in the caucasus mountains , calls for kremlin-run local presidential elections in chechnya on october .
putin launched the plan with a march referendum , in which chechens voted to confirm chechnya 's place within the russian federation .
but guerrillas , who continue to operate in the mountainous region despite the presence of thousands of russian troops , have rejected putin 's peace plan and vowed to press on with their campaign to oust the military .

with the arrival of the first bundeswehr transport plane in uganda , the german military begins its limited peacekeeping mission as part of the eu contingent sent to maintain stability in strife-torn congo . the german military ’ s first transport plane touched down in entebbe , uganda , on friday , loaded with materials for the french-led eu troops deployed across the border in the northeastern region of congo .
the arrival of the transall cargo plane marks the start of a limited military mission , which was approved by german parliament two weeks ago .
the german troops themselves will never see the war-torn country they are supposedly helping to stabilize .
although the bundestag voted nearly unanimously on june 18 to allow up to 350 german soldiers to participate in what is being called the european union ’ s first peacekeeping mission outside europe ’ s borders , it stipulated that no german will set foot in the heavily-embattled congo .
the mission , therefore , is largely a gesture of goodwill , a hand offered to european neighbors .
indirect route to peacekeeping three to five times a week , the sky over entebbe will rumble as the slightly antiquated c-160 transall planes – the german airforce ’ s only cargo carriers - descend for landing .
they are carrying food , drinking water and replacement parts for eu troops stationed in nearby congo .
the trip to entebbe in uganda is long and laborious for the old transall machines , which first entered service in the 1960s .
from germany , the planes take off on an indirect route with refueling stops over france , crete , egypt and djibouti , before arriving two days later at their destination .
once in uganda , the planes turn around and fly right back to their home bases .
the spokesman for the german airforce , lieutenant colonel günter katz , told deutsche welle that germany has not even set up a temporary base in entebbe because the airforce crew is only in uganda for a few brief hours .
" we don ’ t have any bundeswehr soldiers stationed in entebbe .
we fly in there with our crew – that ’ s five men per machine .
the unloading of the planes is left in the hands of the french forces , german troops are not involved .
that means , we are deployed there for one to two hours and then there is no one , " he said describing germany ’ s participation in the mission .
that means germany only provides transportation , and that , in turn , only goes as far as uganda .
the region around bunia in congo , where all the fighting is taking place , is still a good distance away .
but the german planes are prohibited from flying into the actual field of deployment owing to the area ’ s poor infrastructure and security reasons .
" it is not possible for them to fly in there nonstop , land and then fly back out , " katz explained .
" there are only a limited number of landing fields and these have their own specific limitations , " he said .
katz added that the french , who are overseeing the eu mission which is being conducted within the framework of the united nations , understood the logistical obstacles and were not opposed to germany just flying to uganda and leaving the further transport of materials up to others .
restrictive mission of course security is also an underlying concern .
only a week prior to the vote on the congo mission , germany received its first shock connected to overseas military operations : four bundeswehr soldiers had been killed in a bomb attack in kabul , afghanistan , where 2,400 german troops are deployed as part of the international security assistance force .
the attack , which also severely injured 21 others , drove home the risks involved with peacekeeping missions in unstable regions .
in the days leading up to the parliamentary vote on congo , high-level defense officials also expressed their unease over the nature of the conflict , in which countless young children have often been pressed into service as soldiers .
" in congo , we are dealing with drugged child soldiers who have no respect for human life whatsoever , and i do n't want our soldiers to find themselves in a position where they will have to shoot at some of these children in self-defense , " said defense minister peter struck in justification for germany ’ s limited offer of transport and logistical help .
all totaled there are about 100 german soldiers participating in the peacekeeping mission , far fewer than the 350 originally called for in the mandate .
eight german officers are lending their support in the headquarters for the eu congo mission in paris , and one medevac airbus - a fully-equipped emergency flying hospital - based in cologne has been placed on alert .
the german parliament restricted the mandate to three months , a time frame lieutenant colonel katz is certain will not be prolonged .
" we are assuming that the mission will be over on september 1 . "

did he or didn ’ t he apologize ?
berlusconi said on friday he did not offer germany ’ s chancellor gerhard schröder an apology for a nazi slur he made in the eu parliament on wednesday . just as things looked like they were finally calming down , he ’ s done it again .
italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .
" yesterday i made no apology , " he said defiantly at a press conference in rome , which was initially intended to set the tone of the italian eu presidency for the next six months .
instead , the meeting was overshadowed by a diplomatic imbroglio of berlusconi ’ s own making .
the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "
neither chancellor schröder nor foreign minister joschka fischer would comment on berlusconi ’ s most recent statements .
for them , anda said , the issue is resolved .
" i hope very much that there is someone in close contact with the italian prime minister , who can give him good advice , " anda concluded . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlusconi expresses regret over nazi gibe in a heated diplomatic row , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi has apologized to the german chancellor following remarks comparing a german politician to a concentration camp guard -lrb- july 3 , 2007 -rrb- .

italy ’ s prime minister silvio berlusconi , who took over the european union ’ s rotating presidency this week , has stumbled back into the political storm with his speak first-think later manners .
two days after he shocked europe by likening a german member of the european parliament to a nazi concentration camp guard , the offense is still reverberating across the continent .
compounding matters , it appears he ’ s ignited the next round of indignation by back-tracking on his previous expression of " regret . "
on thursday , berlusconi seemed to have made a gesture of conciliation by admitting regret for his slur against the german social democrat martin schulz in a publicly-announced telephone conversation with german chancellor gerhard schröder .
" he expressed regret for the choice of this expression and comparison .
i explained to him that as far as i am concerned this ends the affair , " schröder said at a brief news conference following the conversation with berlusconi .
schröder had demanded a full apology from the italian prime minister for his " totally unacceptable " nazi taunt .
schröder called the remark , in which berlusconi claimed schulz would be perfect for a film role as a nazi guard " a mistake in form and content . "
a half apology or non at all ?
but on friday berlusconi withdrew his apology , claiming his statements of " regret " did not , in fact , amount to an apology .
" yesterday i made no apology , " he said defiantly at a press conference in rome , which was initially intended to set the tone of the italian eu presidency for the next six months .
instead , the meeting was overshadowed by a diplomatic imbroglio of berlusconi ’ s own making .
the outspoken media baron-cum politician reiterated on friday that in his telephone call to schröder he had " strongly underlined " how offended he had been by schulz ’ s criticism , and had " expressed regret " if his remarks , which were intended as ironic jokes , had been " misinterpreted . "
and not one to simply let matters rest , berlusconi dove even further into the fire by trying to rationalize his quip by saying schulz reminded him of a character in the 1960s u.s. television series " hogan ’ s heroes . "
reviving german stereotypes " there was a sergeant schultz who shouted a lot but at the end of the day was a good guy even though the prisoners tried to pull one over him all the time , " the prime minister said in front of journalists and eu commission president romano prodi on friday .
the comedy series , which ran in the u.s. from 1965 to 1971 , depicted the antics of american soldiers held in stalag 13 , a german prisoner-of-war camp .
the character named schulz was a bumbling , rather rotund german guard , whom the prisoners out-tricked in every episode .
although friday ’ s comparison to the schulz in " hogan ’ s heroes " is more positive than the role berlusconi originally had sketched out for the german eu parliamentarian – that of a " kapo " or prisoner appointed by the nazis to guard the concentration camps – the comments still reflect the italian leader ’ s negative stereotypes of germany .
a question of semantics as the news of his latest verbal blunder began to spread , it became clear on friday that berlusconi ’ s qualified apology to schröder was not to be the last word on the matter .
the office of european parliament president pat cox told the press that " these regrets -lsb- by berlusconi -rsb- amount to progress , but it ’ s to the european parliament that mr. berlusconi must present his excuses in public . "
the prime minister ’ s apology must be " made publicly and to the parliament , " the statement from cox said .
schulz , the target of the nazi slur , said friday ’ s explanation and half-apology would not suffice .
" if berlusconi were to say : people i am wrong , it won ’ t be repeated , then this incident is settled .
it has to be made clear to him , this is not a boxing match .
an institution has been offended , " the parliamentarian said on deutschland radio .
as for the german government , chief spokesman bela anda said berlusconi ’ s expression of regret " was interpreted generally to mean an apology .
the rest is just semantics , questions that we don ’ t want to get involved in . "
neither chancellor schröder nor foreign minister joschka fischer would comment on berlusconi ’ s most recent statements .
for them , anda said , the issue is resolved .

at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues . only two weeks after its presentation at an eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , the debate over provisions in the draft european constitution has broken out again in brussels .
before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .
the german government 's " corrections " are among them .
leading the list of changes berlin wants implemented is language that would permit decisions on immigration and asylum policy to be made by a qualified majority decision in brussels .
on friday , foreign minister joschka fischer repeated his government 's demand that it be permitted to retain veto power on such decisions .
" the question of immigration policy remains a particularly sensitive domestic issue " for germany , fischer told the convention .
he said the majority rules provision in the constitution was unacceptable to the german government .
before eu countries can rule on immigration policies by majority vote , he said , they must first agree to common foundations for immigration .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , interior minister otto schilly and the opposition christian democratic union have all rejected eu majority decisions on immigration policy .
germany 's resistance has been fueled by its own domestic paralysis over the issue .
the country 's first-ever immigration bill was recently rejected in the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber , and the government and opposition parties are still seeking a compromise .
support for majority votes on some policies but in a number of other areas , germany has championed the use of the qualified majority voting in decision-making , including the areas of foreign and security policy .
on friday , germany called for foundations to be laid in the constitution for eu justice and domestic policies that would allow for the creation of a european border police and a european prosecutor .
the convention presidency has said it wants to retain veto power in the constitution for tax policy – especially indirect taxes that are necessary for the development of the internal market .
britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close eu constitution dominates debate at summit germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies convention adopts draft constitution europe -pipe- 05.07.2003 germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is calling for a few " corrections " to the eu 's draft constitution .
at a follow-up round of negotiations in brussels , germany 's foreign minister called on the convention drafting the european union 's first constitution to preserve national veto powers on immigration issues . only two weeks after its presentation at an eu summit in thessaloniki , greece , the debate over provisions in the draft european constitution has broken out again in brussels .
before delivering the draft to eu leaders , european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing set out a handful of additional negotiations on contentious issues like majority rule on immigration issues and other policy areas .
so far , more than 1,700 amendments have been submitted to the convention for discussion this month .
the german government 's " corrections " are among them .
leading the list of changes berlin wants implemented is language that would permit decisions on immigration and asylum policy to be made by a qualified majority decision in brussels .
on friday , foreign minister joschka fischer repeated his government 's demand that it be permitted to retain veto power on such decisions .
" the question of immigration policy remains a particularly sensitive domestic issue " for germany , fischer told the convention .
he said the majority rules provision in the constitution was unacceptable to the german government .
before eu countries can rule on immigration policies by majority vote , he said , they must first agree to common foundations for immigration .
german chancellor gerhard schröder , interior minister otto schilly and the opposition christian democratic union have all rejected eu majority decisions on immigration policy .
germany 's resistance has been fueled by its own domestic paralysis over the issue .
the country 's first-ever immigration bill was recently rejected in the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber , and the government and opposition parties are still seeking a compromise .
support for majority votes on some policies but in a number of other areas , germany has championed the use of the qualified majority voting in decision-making , including the areas of foreign and security policy .
on friday , germany called for foundations to be laid in the constitution for eu justice and domestic policies that would allow for the creation of a european border police and a european prosecutor .
the convention presidency has said it wants to retain veto power in the constitution for tax policy – especially indirect taxes that are necessary for the development of the internal market .
britain supports this decision , but germany says majority votes should be used for such policy-making .
though germany supports majority voting on foreign policy decisions , it is unlikely the veto right of member states will be replaced given britain 's insistence that london still control the country 's tax and foreign policy goals .
but on friday , germany 's fischer proposed a compromise that would - in principle - require unanimous decision-making on foreign policy .
the compromise did offer one major loophole : it would permit qualified majority voting on actions or positions tabled by the european foreign minister , a position whose creation the draft constitution calls for .
qualified majority voting requires that more than half of the eu 's member states , representing 60 percent of the eu population , approve an issue .
two more convention sessions are planned next wednesday and thursday to finalize negotiations over the draft constitution .
giscard delivered the vast majority of the document at the meeting of european heads of states and governments in greece on june 20 .
the draft was greeted unanimously by eu leaders , and the final text of the document is to be hammered out at an intergovernmental conference slated to convene in october .

the victims were probably between 15 and 20 years old , police say .
it appears they were decapitated just before arriving at the spot , because they -lsb- the heads -rsb- were still losing blood police spokesman the murders are the latest in a series of gruesome killings that have taken place in el salvador and neighbouring guatemala in recent months .
el salvador has one of the highest murder rates in latin america but the recent spate of killings of young women has been particularly shocking .
the heads of the two latest victims were found just a few metres away from a police station on the outskirts of the capital , san salvador .
francisco parada , the assistant commissioner of the national police , said investigations were under way to track down the bodies of the two women .
there have been at least half a dozen cases since november in which mostly female body parts have been found across the country .
gangland the situation is even worse in neighbouring guatemala , where 150 women were killed in the first three months of this year - twice as many as a year ago .
many had been dismembered .
on thursday a guatemalan pressure group , the network against violence against women , called on the authorities to do more to bring an end to the killings .
several suspects - all reported to be gang members - have been taken into custody but there have been no convictions .
both el salvador and guatemala are plagued by thousands of street gangs whose initiation rites often involve taking part in random murders .

nick stam , director of pc magazine 's testing laboratory in new york is not convinced quite yet .

" we do n't have a system to test ourselves and we know there is all kind of tweaking that can be done and that 's the big issue right now . "
steve jobs also made a big announcement about the g5 processor , ahead of competitors such as chip maker amd .
" the 64-bit revolution has begun and the personal computer will never be the same again , " said mr jobs in his address last week to apple devotees in san francisco .
" the new power mac g5 combines the world 's first 64-bit desktop processor , the industry 's first 1ghz front-side bus and up to 8gb of memory to beat the fastest pentium 4 and dual xeon-based systems in industry-standard benchmarks and real-world professional applications . "
but his statement about being the first 64-bit machine has to be taken in context .
" of course it is n't shipping yet .
it 's not shipping for a couple of months .
so they 're not first-to-market today as steve said , " said mr stam .
" amd may likely decide to come out in august instead of september with their new desktop athlon 64 .

nick stam , director of pc magazine 's testing laboratory in new york is not convinced quite yet .
in 1998 he successfully challenged apple 's claims that the original imac was faster than a windows machine under certain conditions .
so is the new g5 truly the world 's faster personal computer ?
" you take that with a grain of salt because you do n't know what they 're presenting in the benchmark up there , " said mr stam .
" we do n't have a system to test ourselves and we know there is all kind of tweaking that can be done and that 's the big issue right now . "
steve jobs also made a big announcement about the g5 processor , ahead of competitors such as chip maker amd .
" the 64-bit revolution has begun and the personal computer will never be the same again , " said mr jobs in his address last week to apple devotees in san francisco .
" the new power mac g5 combines the world 's first 64-bit desktop processor , the industry 's first 1ghz front-side bus and up to 8gb of memory to beat the fastest pentium 4 and dual xeon-based systems in industry-standard benchmarks and real-world professional applications . "
but his statement about being the first 64-bit machine has to be taken in context .
" of course it is n't shipping yet .
it 's not shipping for a couple of months .

" the new power mac g5 combines the world 's first 64-bit desktop processor , the industry 's first 1ghz front-side bus and up to 8gb of memory to beat the fastest pentium 4 and dual xeon-based systems in industry-standard benchmarks and real-world professional applications . "
but his statement about being the first 64-bit machine has to be taken in context .
" of course it is n't shipping yet .
it 's not shipping for a couple of months .
so they 're not first-to-market today as steve said , " said mr stam .
" amd may likely decide to come out in august instead of september with their new desktop athlon 64 .
it 's bragging rights is what it is , and that 's what steve is great at . "
hardcore fans true macintosh believers see things a different way .

but can we take his word for it ?
nick stam , director of pc magazine 's testing laboratory in new york is not convinced quite yet .
in 1998 he successfully challenged apple 's claims that the original imac was faster than a windows machine under certain conditions .
so is the new g5 truly the world 's faster personal computer ?
" you take that with a grain of salt because you do n't know what they 're presenting in the benchmark up there , " said mr stam .
" we do n't have a system to test ourselves and we know there is all kind of tweaking that can be done and that 's the big issue right now . "

ask anyone about the history of aviation , and they will tell you exactly how it all began .
in december 1903 , the wright brothers took their wood and fabric biplane to the sand dunes of kitty hawk , north carolina .
their historic flight - the first by a powered and manned aircraft - lasted just 12 seconds and covered no more than 120 feet -lrb- 37 metres -rrb- .
but it was the realisation of a centuries-old dream , and it was to change the world .
orville and wilbur wright secured their place in the history books , and this year , their remarkable achievement is being celebrated at centenary events in the united states and around the world .
the wright brothers used cayley 's theories on their first flight but who now remembers sir george cayley ?
very few in britain , it seems , even though this remarkable inventor paved the way for the wright brothers and all the aviators who followed .
if it had not been for sir george 's pioneering work , the wright brothers may not have got off the ground .
cayley is the man described by aviation experts as the father of aeronautics .
he designed his first aircraft as long ago as 1799 , and by the middle of the 19th century , he was building and flying gliders .
alarm a small boy was the first passenger .
but cayley realised that only a flight with a grown man would demonstrate the potential of his strange-looking aircraft .
cayley 's achievements have long been understated in britain ian dewar , yorkshire air museum so in 1853 , sir george 's coachman was ordered to take to the skies at brompton-by-sawdon , near scarborough .
after his alarming experience of air travel , a shocked john appleby faced his employer .
" please , sir george , i wish to give notice , " he said .
" i was hired to drive and not to fly . "
the servant may not have appreciated it , but he had just made history by completing the first manned flight in a fixed-wing aircraft .
amazingly , the inventor whose vision made it possible has been largely forgotten in his own country .
sir george 's coachman was an unwilling pilot " the french and the americans take more interest in sir george than we do , " says the reverend leonard rivett , a retired pastor who has spent years documenting the cayley story .
" he laid the foundations of aeronautics in 1799 by discovering the principles of lift and thrust , and the means of vertical and horizontal control .
" the wright brothers knew that an englishman had worked out the theory , and asked for his research .
" if cayley had come across a lightweight engine , we would have had powered flight 50s years before the wrights . "
' george who ? '
but back in the 19th century , the yorkshire inventor was way ahead of the available technology .
powered flight would have to wait for the wright flyer with its simple 12-horsepower engine .
the importance of cayley 's work has been acknowledged by the us space agency nasa , and many other scientific institutions around the world .
but when his name is mentioned in britain , the puzzled response is usually : " george who ? "
his papers are in the archives of the royal aeronautical society , but few museums display his work , and it is difficult to find public recognition for his achievements .
this weekend , 150 years after sir george 's coachman was carried aloft , the aircraft will be given pride of place in celebrations intended to remind britain about its forgotten pioneer of aviation .
' understated ' on saturday , an exact copy of the glider , made from modern materials , will be flown at brompton dale , watched by descendants of sir george and his coachman .
and on sunday , vips will gather and a band will play at the yorkshire air museum , at elvington , as replicas of cayley 's aircraft and the wright flyer are displayed alongside each other .
" cayley 's achievements have long been understated in britain , " says ian dewar , the museum 's operations manager .
" my generation was brought up to believe that the wright brothers were the fathers of aviation , but they attributed their success to his achievements .
" after their first flight , they said they owed it all to george cayley . "
this year the world salutes the wright brothers as we mark the completion of the first 100 years of powered flight .
for us in britain , it seems a good time to give proper recognition to the yorkshireman who made it all possible .

ask anyone about the history of aviation , and they will tell you exactly how it all began .
in december 1903 , the wright brothers took their wood and fabric biplane to the sand dunes of kitty hawk , north carolina .
their historic flight - the first by a powered and manned aircraft - lasted just 12 seconds and covered no more than 120 feet -lrb- 37 metres -rrb- .
but it was the realisation of a centuries-old dream , and it was to change the world .
orville and wilbur wright secured their place in the history books , and this year , their remarkable achievement is being celebrated at centenary events in the united states and around the world .
the wright brothers used cayley 's theories on their first flight but who now remembers sir george cayley ?
very few in britain , it seems , even though this remarkable inventor paved the way for the wright brothers and all the aviators who followed .
if it had not been for sir george 's pioneering work , the wright brothers may not have got off the ground .
cayley is the man described by aviation experts as the father of aeronautics .
he designed his first aircraft as long ago as 1799 , and by the middle of the 19th century , he was building and flying gliders .
alarm a small boy was the first passenger .
but cayley realised that only a flight with a grown man would demonstrate the potential of his strange-looking aircraft .
cayley 's achievements have long been understated in britain ian dewar , yorkshire air museum so in 1853 , sir george 's coachman was ordered to take to the skies at brompton-by-sawdon , near scarborough .
after his alarming experience of air travel , a shocked john appleby faced his employer .
" please , sir george , i wish to give notice , " he said .
" i was hired to drive and not to fly . "
the servant may not have appreciated it , but he had just made history by completing the first manned flight in a fixed-wing aircraft .
amazingly , the inventor whose vision made it possible has been largely forgotten in his own country .
sir george 's coachman was an unwilling pilot " the french and the americans take more interest in sir george than we do , " says the reverend leonard rivett , a retired pastor who has spent years documenting the cayley story .
" he laid the foundations of aeronautics in 1799 by discovering the principles of lift and thrust , and the means of vertical and horizontal control .
" the wright brothers knew that an englishman had worked out the theory , and asked for his research .
" if cayley had come across a lightweight engine , we would have had powered flight 50s years before the wrights . "
' george who ? '
but back in the 19th century , the yorkshire inventor was way ahead of the available technology .
powered flight would have to wait for the wright flyer with its simple 12-horsepower engine .
the importance of cayley 's work has been acknowledged by the us space agency nasa , and many other scientific institutions around the world .
but when his name is mentioned in britain , the puzzled response is usually : " george who ? "
his papers are in the archives of the royal aeronautical society , but few museums display his work , and it is difficult to find public recognition for his achievements .
this weekend , 150 years after sir george 's coachman was carried aloft , the aircraft will be given pride of place in celebrations intended to remind britain about its forgotten pioneer of aviation .
' understated ' on saturday , an exact copy of the glider , made from modern materials , will be flown at brompton dale , watched by descendants of sir george and his coachman .
and on sunday , vips will gather and a band will play at the yorkshire air museum , at elvington , as replicas of cayley 's aircraft and the wright flyer are displayed alongside each other .
" cayley 's achievements have long been understated in britain , " says ian dewar , the museum 's operations manager .

their historic flight - the first by a powered and manned aircraft - lasted just 12 seconds and covered no more than 120 feet -lrb- 37 metres -rrb- .
but it was the realisation of a centuries-old dream , and it was to change the world .
orville and wilbur wright secured their place in the history books , and this year , their remarkable achievement is being celebrated at centenary events in the united states and around the world .
the wright brothers used cayley 's theories on their first flight but who now remembers sir george cayley ?
very few in britain , it seems , even though this remarkable inventor paved the way for the wright brothers and all the aviators who followed .
if it had not been for sir george 's pioneering work , the wright brothers may not have got off the ground .
cayley is the man described by aviation experts as the father of aeronautics .
he designed his first aircraft as long ago as 1799 , and by the middle of the 19th century , he was building and flying gliders .
alarm a small boy was the first passenger .
but cayley realised that only a flight with a grown man would demonstrate the potential of his strange-looking aircraft .
cayley 's achievements have long been understated in britain ian dewar , yorkshire air museum so in 1853 , sir george 's coachman was ordered to take to the skies at brompton-by-sawdon , near scarborough .
after his alarming experience of air travel , a shocked john appleby faced his employer .
" please , sir george , i wish to give notice , " he said .
" i was hired to drive and not to fly . "
the servant may not have appreciated it , but he had just made history by completing the first manned flight in a fixed-wing aircraft .
amazingly , the inventor whose vision made it possible has been largely forgotten in his own country .
sir george 's coachman was an unwilling pilot " the french and the americans take more interest in sir george than we do , " says the reverend leonard rivett , a retired pastor who has spent years documenting the cayley story .
" he laid the foundations of aeronautics in 1799 by discovering the principles of lift and thrust , and the means of vertical and horizontal control .
" the wright brothers knew that an englishman had worked out the theory , and asked for his research .
" if cayley had come across a lightweight engine , we would have had powered flight 50s years before the wrights . "
' george who ? '
but back in the 19th century , the yorkshire inventor was way ahead of the available technology .
powered flight would have to wait for the wright flyer with its simple 12-horsepower engine .
the importance of cayley 's work has been acknowledged by the us space agency nasa , and many other scientific institutions around the world .
but when his name is mentioned in britain , the puzzled response is usually : " george who ? "
his papers are in the archives of the royal aeronautical society , but few museums display his work , and it is difficult to find public recognition for his achievements .
this weekend , 150 years after sir george 's coachman was carried aloft , the aircraft will be given pride of place in celebrations intended to remind britain about its forgotten pioneer of aviation .
' understated ' on saturday , an exact copy of the glider , made from modern materials , will be flown at brompton dale , watched by descendants of sir george and his coachman .
and on sunday , vips will gather and a band will play at the yorkshire air museum , at elvington , as replicas of cayley 's aircraft and the wright flyer are displayed alongside each other .
" cayley 's achievements have long been understated in britain , " says ian dewar , the museum 's operations manager .
" my generation was brought up to believe that the wright brothers were the fathers of aviation , but they attributed their success to his achievements .
" after their first flight , they said they owed it all to george cayley . "
this year the world salutes the wright brothers as we mark the completion of the first 100 years of powered flight .
for us in britain , it seems a good time to give proper recognition to the yorkshireman who made it all possible .
