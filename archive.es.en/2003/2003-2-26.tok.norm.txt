as cologne gears up for its annual party ritual when millions of visitors descend upon the city for the karneval , local businesses are rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of big profits . germany ’ s karneval celebrations are a mighty force , and that ’ s not just taking into consideration the sights , sounds , and general debauchery - though they certainly are noteworthy .
the festivities also pack a considerable economic punch , at least in germany 's bigger cities . in cologne , karneval central , millions jam the streets for one of the biggest open-air celebrations in the world .
they ’ re not only party animals , but power consumers too - of hotel rooms , taxi trips , costumes and , of course , alcohol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karneval brings big bucks estimates vary about the exact amount of cash that karneval visitors bring to the city .
the association of german karneval estimates that karneval revelers bring over a billion euro to a city like cologne alone every year . the numbers are telling : 3,000 karneval-related jobs , 100,000 trips to the hairdresser , 300,000 costumes , and 450,000 taxi trips .
and these are just the old figures - the city of cologne hasn ’ t updated them in years .
one can only imagine what they might be like today : “ you couldn ’ t give me a high enough estimate , ” cologne spokesman josef sommer told dw-radio .
“ surely we get over 3 million visitors a year . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the saying may go , “ every jester is different ” -lrb- in this case , referring to the many who dress up like jesters and clowns during the festivities -rrb- , but that ’ s not true when you look at their spending habits . according to the latest figures compiled by ‘ großen kölner 1883 ’ , a local paper , the average person spends about € 160 -lrb- $ 173 -rrb- on drinks , food , and souvenirs .
multiply that by 3 million revellers , and that translates into € 48 million . costs of pulling off karneval considerably high out of that about € 25,5 million are then pooled right back into the festivities as the money gets distributed among the city ’ s some 105 historic karneval associations . after all staging such a huge event also includes some rather significant costs .
though none in the city like to talk much about the entertainment costs of karneval , it 's a well-known fact that a major amount of the funds are swallowed by them . a professional comic-jester -lrb- “ büttenreder ” -rrb- , who is well-versed in the tradition of humorous rhyming rakes in € 1,300 euro for a mere fifteen minute performance , while a popular music group costs around € 2,200 euro . the karneval associations , which begin to prepare for the karneval from the end of the previous season , also have other costs to bear : for instance when the old town stages its traditional “ weiberfastnacht ” celebrations - the “ night of the women ” or " women 's karneval " when the women have free reign to troll the city streets chopping off men ’ s ties . that 's when the associations need to dig deeper into their pockets and come up with € 21,000 for security , ambulances , toilets , garbage removal , and more .
it ’ s not unusual for some of the city 's bigger karneval associations to have an annual budget of € 500,000 . karneval paraphernalia selling like hot cakes one area where money is obviously not given a thought by hard-core karneval goers are costumes .
it 's estimated that they spend about € 30 million on costumes ranging from the outrageous to the downright bizarre .
and this is where the smaller businesses benefit the most . talk of a recession may dominate the headlines , but merchants say they haven ’ t felt the pinch .
“ we don ’ t feel it at all , ” says frank schröder , the manager of karnvalswierts , the city ’ s largest specialty store for carnival items .
“ precisely because things aren ’ t going so well with the economy , people - more than ever - are in the mood to party . ” in fact , schröder ’ s shop added an additional 550 qm of space and twelve additional cash registers , and , according to shröder , they ’ re only keeping up with demand .
what ’ s more , his 100 employees don ’ t find themselves idle during others times of year either : costumes aren ’ t just worn during the karneval , there ’ s also the christopher street day and the love parade .

doping figures for 2002 show that positive testing for banned drugs has remained constant over the past three years - a far cry from the alarming doping cases that emerged in east germany . the federal institute of sports sciences in bonn has released the annual report into the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in german sports .
in 2002 , a total of 56 positive results were recorded from tests carried out on 7,930 german athletes last year .
the number of positive tests remained consistent with previous results , which suggests that the number of identified doping incidents has reached a plateau .
in 2001 , 44 people tested positive for banned substances from a total of 7,831 people , while in 2000 it was 55 out of 8,255 sports people , who failed the drug tests .
the news comes as german sportswear manufacturer adidas revealed that it was donating € 50,000 -lrb- $ 53,840 -rrb- to the national anti-doping agency to continue its fight to stamp out the use of banned substances in sports .
this is in addition to the € 5.5 million donated to the cause by the german government and the combined € 1 million collected from the 16 german states .
doping an explosive topic in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united germany still deals with shadows of the past .
the subject of doping is a sensitive one in germany , often conjuring up memories of the horrific scale of drug-taking by athletes in east germany , which only came to light after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the reunified germany has since had to deal with the spectre of doping after details of the east germany 's doping program sent shockwaves through the world of sport . even today , its infamous reputation for doping has n't been totally erased from the world of german sports .
in 1974 , the communist government of east germany turned to sports as a means of cleaning up its image tarnished by widely publicized pictures of people dying in their attempts to reach the free west .
east german officials decided to turn their nation into a sporting superpower , fighting the cold war inside sports stadiums across the globe .
that shift in policy marked the beginning of an unprecedented systematic doping campaign , which involved pumping budding atletes and top sports stars with an array of performance-enhancing drugs , often without their knowledge .
east german bid for sports domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug testing in a laboratory .
with the goal being victory at any cost , officials began giving oral turinabol , a powerful performance-enhancing steroid to all competing athletes , including children as young as 10 years old , telling the athletes the little blue pills were vitamins .
elite athletes were taken to a highly secure sports institute where they were tested in laboratory-like conditions .
researchers at the institute even calculated how long it took for the steroids to pass through the athletes ’ bodies , so as to ensure that the steroids could be stopped in time to test clean for competitions .
" i can remember getting 10 tables at a time , 30 a day , " carola nitschke , the east german athlete who broke the world breaststroke record when she was 14 years old , said in an interview with abc news in 2001 .
nitschke 's testimony is one among thousands that came to light once the east german program was exposed .
the doping program , called state plan 14.25 , continued until 1989 .
after east germany and west germany united in 1990 , the west appointed a committee to investigate the activities of east german scientists .
research on the program , previously highly classified , were unearthed and showed that that virtually all of east german 's top champions had been doped under state plan 14.25 .
officials and doctors prosecuted however , despite overwhelming evidence , it took nearly 10 years before those responsible were brought to account .
the doctors and officials who were brought to trial and prosecuted , including manfred ewald , the former head of the east german gymnastics and sports federation , expressed regret and claimed their actions were forced upon them by east germany 's communist leaders .
their sentences were lenient ; most received suspended prison terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former east german swimming stars and victims of state plan 14.25 today the institute of sports sciences and the anti-doping agency work to keep german sports doping free .
but unfortunately it may be too late to completely erase the dark legacy of the east german doping problem .

the subject of doping is a sensitive one in germany , often conjuring up memories of the horrific scale of drug-taking by athletes in east germany , which only came to light after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the reunified germany has since had to deal with the spectre of doping after details of the east germany 's doping program sent shockwaves through the world of sport . even today , its infamous reputation for doping has n't been totally erased from the world of german sports .
in 1974 , the communist government of east germany turned to sports as a means of cleaning up its image tarnished by widely publicized pictures of people dying in their attempts to reach the free west .
east german officials decided to turn their nation into a sporting superpower , fighting the cold war inside sports stadiums across the globe .
that shift in policy marked the beginning of an unprecedented systematic doping campaign , which involved pumping budding atletes and top sports stars with an array of performance-enhancing drugs , often without their knowledge .

elite athletes were taken to a highly secure sports institute where they were tested in laboratory-like conditions .
researchers at the institute even calculated how long it took for the steroids to pass through the athletes ’ bodies , so as to ensure that the steroids could be stopped in time to test clean for competitions .
" i can remember getting 10 tables at a time , 30 a day , " carola nitschke , the east german athlete who broke the world breaststroke record when she was 14 years old , said in an interview with abc news in 2001 .

the doping program , called state plan 14.25 , continued until 1989 .
after east germany and west germany united in 1990 , the west appointed a committee to investigate the activities of east german scientists .
research on the program , previously highly classified , were unearthed and showed that that virtually all of east german 's top champions had been doped under state plan 14.25 .

doping figures for 2002 show that positive testing for banned drugs has remained constant over the past three years - a far cry from the alarming doping cases that emerged in east germany . the federal institute of sports sciences in bonn has released the annual report into the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in german sports .
in 2002 , a total of 56 positive results were recorded from tests carried out on 7,930 german athletes last year .
the number of positive tests remained consistent with previous results , which suggests that the number of identified doping incidents has reached a plateau .
in 2001 , 44 people tested positive for banned substances from a total of 7,831 people , while in 2000 it was 55 out of 8,255 sports people , who failed the drug tests .
the news comes as german sportswear manufacturer adidas revealed that it was donating € 50,000 -lrb- $ 53,840 -rrb- to the national anti-doping agency to continue its fight to stamp out the use of banned substances in sports .
this is in addition to the € 5.5 million donated to the cause by the german government and the combined € 1 million collected from the 16 german states .

as cologne gears up for its annual party ritual when millions of visitors descend upon the city for the karneval , local businesses are rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of big profits . germany ’ s karneval celebrations are a mighty force , and that ’ s not just taking into consideration the sights , sounds , and general debauchery - though they certainly are noteworthy .
the festivities also pack a considerable economic punch , at least in germany 's bigger cities . in cologne , karneval central , millions jam the streets for one of the biggest open-air celebrations in the world .
they ’ re not only party animals , but power consumers too - of hotel rooms , taxi trips , costumes and , of course , alcohol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karneval brings big bucks estimates vary about the exact amount of cash that karneval visitors bring to the city .
the association of german karneval estimates that karneval revelers bring over a billion euro to a city like cologne alone every year . the numbers are telling : 3,000 karneval-related jobs , 100,000 trips to the hairdresser , 300,000 costumes , and 450,000 taxi trips .
and these are just the old figures - the city of cologne hasn ’ t updated them in years .
one can only imagine what they might be like today : “ you couldn ’ t give me a high enough estimate , ” cologne spokesman josef sommer told dw-radio .
“ surely we get over 3 million visitors a year . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the saying may go , “ every jester is different ” -lrb- in this case , referring to the many who dress up like jesters and clowns during the festivities -rrb- , but that ’ s not true when you look at their spending habits . according to the latest figures compiled by ‘ großen kölner 1883 ’ , a local paper , the average person spends about € 160 -lrb- $ 173 -rrb- on drinks , food , and souvenirs .
multiply that by 3 million revellers , and that translates into € 48 million . costs of pulling off karneval considerably high out of that about € 25,5 million are then pooled right back into the festivities as the money gets distributed among the city ’ s some 105 historic karneval associations . after all staging such a huge event also includes some rather significant costs .
though none in the city like to talk much about the entertainment costs of karneval , it 's a well-known fact that a major amount of the funds are swallowed by them . a professional comic-jester -lrb- “ büttenreder ” -rrb- , who is well-versed in the tradition of humorous rhyming rakes in € 1,300 euro for a mere fifteen minute performance , while a popular music group costs around € 2,200 euro . the karneval associations , which begin to prepare for the karneval from the end of the previous season , also have other costs to bear : for instance when the old town stages its traditional “ weiberfastnacht ” celebrations - the “ night of the women ” or " women 's karneval " when the women have free reign to troll the city streets chopping off men ’ s ties . that 's when the associations need to dig deeper into their pockets and come up with € 21,000 for security , ambulances , toilets , garbage removal , and more .
it ’ s not unusual for some of the city 's bigger karneval associations to have an annual budget of € 500,000 . karneval paraphernalia selling like hot cakes one area where money is obviously not given a thought by hard-core karneval goers are costumes .
it 's estimated that they spend about € 30 million on costumes ranging from the outrageous to the downright bizarre .
and this is where the smaller businesses benefit the most . talk of a recession may dominate the headlines , but merchants say they haven ’ t felt the pinch .
“ we don ’ t feel it at all , ” says frank schröder , the manager of karnvalswierts , the city ’ s largest specialty store for carnival items .
“ precisely because things aren ’ t going so well with the economy , people - more than ever - are in the mood to party . ” in fact , schröder ’ s shop added an additional 550 qm of space and twelve additional cash registers , and , according to shröder , they ’ re only keeping up with demand .
what ’ s more , his 100 employees don ’ t find themselves idle during others times of year either : costumes aren ’ t just worn during the karneval , there ’ s also the christopher street day and the love parade .

doping figures for 2002 show that positive testing for banned drugs has remained constant over the past three years - a far cry from the alarming doping cases that emerged in east germany . the federal institute of sports sciences in bonn has released the annual report into the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in german sports .
in 2002 , a total of 56 positive results were recorded from tests carried out on 7,930 german athletes last year .
the number of positive tests remained consistent with previous results , which suggests that the number of identified doping incidents has reached a plateau .
in 2001 , 44 people tested positive for banned substances from a total of 7,831 people , while in 2000 it was 55 out of 8,255 sports people , who failed the drug tests .
the news comes as german sportswear manufacturer adidas revealed that it was donating € 50,000 -lrb- $ 53,840 -rrb- to the national anti-doping agency to continue its fight to stamp out the use of banned substances in sports .
this is in addition to the € 5.5 million donated to the cause by the german government and the combined € 1 million collected from the 16 german states .
doping an explosive topic in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united germany still deals with shadows of the past .
the subject of doping is a sensitive one in germany , often conjuring up memories of the horrific scale of drug-taking by athletes in east germany , which only came to light after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the reunified germany has since had to deal with the spectre of doping after details of the east germany 's doping program sent shockwaves through the world of sport . even today , its infamous reputation for doping has n't been totally erased from the world of german sports .
in 1974 , the communist government of east germany turned to sports as a means of cleaning up its image tarnished by widely publicized pictures of people dying in their attempts to reach the free west .
east german officials decided to turn their nation into a sporting superpower , fighting the cold war inside sports stadiums across the globe .
that shift in policy marked the beginning of an unprecedented systematic doping campaign , which involved pumping budding atletes and top sports stars with an array of performance-enhancing drugs , often without their knowledge .
east german bid for sports domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug testing in a laboratory .
with the goal being victory at any cost , officials began giving oral turinabol , a powerful performance-enhancing steroid to all competing athletes , including children as young as 10 years old , telling the athletes the little blue pills were vitamins .
elite athletes were taken to a highly secure sports institute where they were tested in laboratory-like conditions .
researchers at the institute even calculated how long it took for the steroids to pass through the athletes ’ bodies , so as to ensure that the steroids could be stopped in time to test clean for competitions .
" i can remember getting 10 tables at a time , 30 a day , " carola nitschke , the east german athlete who broke the world breaststroke record when she was 14 years old , said in an interview with abc news in 2001 .
nitschke 's testimony is one among thousands that came to light once the east german program was exposed .
the doping program , called state plan 14.25 , continued until 1989 .
after east germany and west germany united in 1990 , the west appointed a committee to investigate the activities of east german scientists .
research on the program , previously highly classified , were unearthed and showed that that virtually all of east german 's top champions had been doped under state plan 14.25 .
officials and doctors prosecuted however , despite overwhelming evidence , it took nearly 10 years before those responsible were brought to account .
the doctors and officials who were brought to trial and prosecuted , including manfred ewald , the former head of the east german gymnastics and sports federation , expressed regret and claimed their actions were forced upon them by east germany 's communist leaders .
their sentences were lenient ; most received suspended prison terms .

doping figures for 2002 show that positive testing for banned drugs has remained constant over the past three years - a far cry from the alarming doping cases that emerged in east germany . the federal institute of sports sciences in bonn has released the annual report into the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in german sports .
in 2002 , a total of 56 positive results were recorded from tests carried out on 7,930 german athletes last year .
the number of positive tests remained consistent with previous results , which suggests that the number of identified doping incidents has reached a plateau .
in 2001 , 44 people tested positive for banned substances from a total of 7,831 people , while in 2000 it was 55 out of 8,255 sports people , who failed the drug tests .
the news comes as german sportswear manufacturer adidas revealed that it was donating € 50,000 -lrb- $ 53,840 -rrb- to the national anti-doping agency to continue its fight to stamp out the use of banned substances in sports .
this is in addition to the € 5.5 million donated to the cause by the german government and the combined € 1 million collected from the 16 german states .
doping an explosive topic in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united germany still deals with shadows of the past .
the subject of doping is a sensitive one in germany , often conjuring up memories of the horrific scale of drug-taking by athletes in east germany , which only came to light after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the reunified germany has since had to deal with the spectre of doping after details of the east germany 's doping program sent shockwaves through the world of sport . even today , its infamous reputation for doping has n't been totally erased from the world of german sports .
in 1974 , the communist government of east germany turned to sports as a means of cleaning up its image tarnished by widely publicized pictures of people dying in their attempts to reach the free west .
east german officials decided to turn their nation into a sporting superpower , fighting the cold war inside sports stadiums across the globe .
that shift in policy marked the beginning of an unprecedented systematic doping campaign , which involved pumping budding atletes and top sports stars with an array of performance-enhancing drugs , often without their knowledge .
east german bid for sports domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug testing in a laboratory .
with the goal being victory at any cost , officials began giving oral turinabol , a powerful performance-enhancing steroid to all competing athletes , including children as young as 10 years old , telling the athletes the little blue pills were vitamins .
elite athletes were taken to a highly secure sports institute where they were tested in laboratory-like conditions .
researchers at the institute even calculated how long it took for the steroids to pass through the athletes ’ bodies , so as to ensure that the steroids could be stopped in time to test clean for competitions .
" i can remember getting 10 tables at a time , 30 a day , " carola nitschke , the east german athlete who broke the world breaststroke record when she was 14 years old , said in an interview with abc news in 2001 .
nitschke 's testimony is one among thousands that came to light once the east german program was exposed .
the doping program , called state plan 14.25 , continued until 1989 .
after east germany and west germany united in 1990 , the west appointed a committee to investigate the activities of east german scientists .
research on the program , previously highly classified , were unearthed and showed that that virtually all of east german 's top champions had been doped under state plan 14.25 .
officials and doctors prosecuted however , despite overwhelming evidence , it took nearly 10 years before those responsible were brought to account .
the doctors and officials who were brought to trial and prosecuted , including manfred ewald , the former head of the east german gymnastics and sports federation , expressed regret and claimed their actions were forced upon them by east germany 's communist leaders .
their sentences were lenient ; most received suspended prison terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former east german swimming stars and victims of state plan 14.25 today the institute of sports sciences and the anti-doping agency work to keep german sports doping free .
but unfortunately it may be too late to completely erase the dark legacy of the east german doping problem .

as cologne gears up for its annual party ritual when millions of visitors descend upon the city for the karneval , local businesses are rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of big profits . germany ’ s karneval celebrations are a mighty force , and that ’ s not just taking into consideration the sights , sounds , and general debauchery - though they certainly are noteworthy .
the festivities also pack a considerable economic punch , at least in germany 's bigger cities . in cologne , karneval central , millions jam the streets for one of the biggest open-air celebrations in the world .
they ’ re not only party animals , but power consumers too - of hotel rooms , taxi trips , costumes and , of course , alcohol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karneval brings big bucks estimates vary about the exact amount of cash that karneval visitors bring to the city .
the association of german karneval estimates that karneval revelers bring over a billion euro to a city like cologne alone every year . the numbers are telling : 3,000 karneval-related jobs , 100,000 trips to the hairdresser , 300,000 costumes , and 450,000 taxi trips .
and these are just the old figures - the city of cologne hasn ’ t updated them in years .
one can only imagine what they might be like today : “ you couldn ’ t give me a high enough estimate , ” cologne spokesman josef sommer told dw-radio .
“ surely we get over 3 million visitors a year . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the saying may go , “ every jester is different ” -lrb- in this case , referring to the many who dress up like jesters and clowns during the festivities -rrb- , but that ’ s not true when you look at their spending habits . according to the latest figures compiled by ‘ großen kölner 1883 ’ , a local paper , the average person spends about € 160 -lrb- $ 173 -rrb- on drinks , food , and souvenirs .
multiply that by 3 million revellers , and that translates into € 48 million . costs of pulling off karneval considerably high out of that about € 25,5 million are then pooled right back into the festivities as the money gets distributed among the city ’ s some 105 historic karneval associations . after all staging such a huge event also includes some rather significant costs .
though none in the city like to talk much about the entertainment costs of karneval , it 's a well-known fact that a major amount of the funds are swallowed by them . a professional comic-jester -lrb- “ büttenreder ” -rrb- , who is well-versed in the tradition of humorous rhyming rakes in € 1,300 euro for a mere fifteen minute performance , while a popular music group costs around € 2,200 euro . the karneval associations , which begin to prepare for the karneval from the end of the previous season , also have other costs to bear : for instance when the old town stages its traditional “ weiberfastnacht ” celebrations - the “ night of the women ” or " women 's karneval " when the women have free reign to troll the city streets chopping off men ’ s ties . that 's when the associations need to dig deeper into their pockets and come up with € 21,000 for security , ambulances , toilets , garbage removal , and more .
it ’ s not unusual for some of the city 's bigger karneval associations to have an annual budget of € 500,000 . karneval paraphernalia selling like hot cakes one area where money is obviously not given a thought by hard-core karneval goers are costumes .
it 's estimated that they spend about € 30 million on costumes ranging from the outrageous to the downright bizarre .
and this is where the smaller businesses benefit the most . talk of a recession may dominate the headlines , but merchants say they haven ’ t felt the pinch .
“ we don ’ t feel it at all , ” says frank schröder , the manager of karnvalswierts , the city ’ s largest specialty store for carnival items .
“ precisely because things aren ’ t going so well with the economy , people - more than ever - are in the mood to party . ” in fact , schröder ’ s shop added an additional 550 qm of space and twelve additional cash registers , and , according to shröder , they ’ re only keeping up with demand .

doping figures for 2002 show that positive testing for banned drugs has remained constant over the past three years - a far cry from the alarming doping cases that emerged in east germany . the federal institute of sports sciences in bonn has released the annual report into the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in german sports .
in 2002 , a total of 56 positive results were recorded from tests carried out on 7,930 german athletes last year .
the number of positive tests remained consistent with previous results , which suggests that the number of identified doping incidents has reached a plateau .
in 2001 , 44 people tested positive for banned substances from a total of 7,831 people , while in 2000 it was 55 out of 8,255 sports people , who failed the drug tests .

as cologne gears up for its annual party ritual when millions of visitors descend upon the city for the karneval , local businesses are rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of big profits . germany ’ s karneval celebrations are a mighty force , and that ’ s not just taking into consideration the sights , sounds , and general debauchery - though they certainly are noteworthy .
the festivities also pack a considerable economic punch , at least in germany 's bigger cities . in cologne , karneval central , millions jam the streets for one of the biggest open-air celebrations in the world .
they ’ re not only party animals , but power consumers too - of hotel rooms , taxi trips , costumes and , of course , alcohol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karneval brings big bucks estimates vary about the exact amount of cash that karneval visitors bring to the city .
the association of german karneval estimates that karneval revelers bring over a billion euro to a city like cologne alone every year . the numbers are telling : 3,000 karneval-related jobs , 100,000 trips to the hairdresser , 300,000 costumes , and 450,000 taxi trips .
and these are just the old figures - the city of cologne hasn ’ t updated them in years .
one can only imagine what they might be like today : “ you couldn ’ t give me a high enough estimate , ” cologne spokesman josef sommer told dw-radio .
“ surely we get over 3 million visitors a year . ”

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the saying may go , “ every jester is different ” -lrb- in this case , referring to the many who dress up like jesters and clowns during the festivities -rrb- , but that ’ s not true when you look at their spending habits . according to the latest figures compiled by ‘ großen kölner 1883 ’ , a local paper , the average person spends about € 160 -lrb- $ 173 -rrb- on drinks , food , and souvenirs .
multiply that by 3 million revellers , and that translates into € 48 million . costs of pulling off karneval considerably high out of that about € 25,5 million are then pooled right back into the festivities as the money gets distributed among the city ’ s some 105 historic karneval associations . after all staging such a huge event also includes some rather significant costs .
though none in the city like to talk much about the entertainment costs of karneval , it 's a well-known fact that a major amount of the funds are swallowed by them . a professional comic-jester -lrb- “ büttenreder ” -rrb- , who is well-versed in the tradition of humorous rhyming rakes in € 1,300 euro for a mere fifteen minute performance , while a popular music group costs around € 2,200 euro . the karneval associations , which begin to prepare for the karneval from the end of the previous season , also have other costs to bear : for instance when the old town stages its traditional “ weiberfastnacht ” celebrations - the “ night of the women ” or " women 's karneval " when the women have free reign to troll the city streets chopping off men ’ s ties . that 's when the associations need to dig deeper into their pockets and come up with € 21,000 for security , ambulances , toilets , garbage removal , and more .
it ’ s not unusual for some of the city 's bigger karneval associations to have an annual budget of € 500,000 . karneval paraphernalia selling like hot cakes one area where money is obviously not given a thought by hard-core karneval goers are costumes .
it 's estimated that they spend about € 30 million on costumes ranging from the outrageous to the downright bizarre .
and this is where the smaller businesses benefit the most . talk of a recession may dominate the headlines , but merchants say they haven ’ t felt the pinch .
“ we don ’ t feel it at all , ” says frank schröder , the manager of karnvalswierts , the city ’ s largest specialty store for carnival items .
“ precisely because things aren ’ t going so well with the economy , people - more than ever - are in the mood to party . ” in fact , schröder ’ s shop added an additional 550 qm of space and twelve additional cash registers , and , according to shröder , they ’ re only keeping up with demand .
what ’ s more , his 100 employees don ’ t find themselves idle during others times of year either : costumes aren ’ t just worn during the karneval , there ’ s also the christopher street day and the love parade .

doping figures for 2002 show that positive testing for banned drugs has remained constant over the past three years - a far cry from the alarming doping cases that emerged in east germany . the federal institute of sports sciences in bonn has released the annual report into the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in german sports .
in 2002 , a total of 56 positive results were recorded from tests carried out on 7,930 german athletes last year .
the number of positive tests remained consistent with previous results , which suggests that the number of identified doping incidents has reached a plateau .
in 2001 , 44 people tested positive for banned substances from a total of 7,831 people , while in 2000 it was 55 out of 8,255 sports people , who failed the drug tests .
the news comes as german sportswear manufacturer adidas revealed that it was donating € 50,000 -lrb- $ 53,840 -rrb- to the national anti-doping agency to continue its fight to stamp out the use of banned substances in sports .
this is in addition to the € 5.5 million donated to the cause by the german government and the combined € 1 million collected from the 16 german states .
doping an explosive topic in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united germany still deals with shadows of the past .
the subject of doping is a sensitive one in germany , often conjuring up memories of the horrific scale of drug-taking by athletes in east germany , which only came to light after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the reunified germany has since had to deal with the spectre of doping after details of the east germany 's doping program sent shockwaves through the world of sport . even today , its infamous reputation for doping has n't been totally erased from the world of german sports .
in 1974 , the communist government of east germany turned to sports as a means of cleaning up its image tarnished by widely publicized pictures of people dying in their attempts to reach the free west .
east german officials decided to turn their nation into a sporting superpower , fighting the cold war inside sports stadiums across the globe .
that shift in policy marked the beginning of an unprecedented systematic doping campaign , which involved pumping budding atletes and top sports stars with an array of performance-enhancing drugs , often without their knowledge .
east german bid for sports domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug testing in a laboratory .
with the goal being victory at any cost , officials began giving oral turinabol , a powerful performance-enhancing steroid to all competing athletes , including children as young as 10 years old , telling the athletes the little blue pills were vitamins .
elite athletes were taken to a highly secure sports institute where they were tested in laboratory-like conditions .
researchers at the institute even calculated how long it took for the steroids to pass through the athletes ’ bodies , so as to ensure that the steroids could be stopped in time to test clean for competitions .
" i can remember getting 10 tables at a time , 30 a day , " carola nitschke , the east german athlete who broke the world breaststroke record when she was 14 years old , said in an interview with abc news in 2001 .
nitschke 's testimony is one among thousands that came to light once the east german program was exposed .
the doping program , called state plan 14.25 , continued until 1989 .
after east germany and west germany united in 1990 , the west appointed a committee to investigate the activities of east german scientists .
research on the program , previously highly classified , were unearthed and showed that that virtually all of east german 's top champions had been doped under state plan 14.25 .
officials and doctors prosecuted however , despite overwhelming evidence , it took nearly 10 years before those responsible were brought to account .
the doctors and officials who were brought to trial and prosecuted , including manfred ewald , the former head of the east german gymnastics and sports federation , expressed regret and claimed their actions were forced upon them by east germany 's communist leaders .
their sentences were lenient ; most received suspended prison terms .

doping figures for 2002 show that positive testing for banned drugs has remained constant over the past three years - a far cry from the alarming doping cases that emerged in east germany . the federal institute of sports sciences in bonn has released the annual report into the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in german sports .
in 2002 , a total of 56 positive results were recorded from tests carried out on 7,930 german athletes last year .
the number of positive tests remained consistent with previous results , which suggests that the number of identified doping incidents has reached a plateau .
in 2001 , 44 people tested positive for banned substances from a total of 7,831 people , while in 2000 it was 55 out of 8,255 sports people , who failed the drug tests .
the news comes as german sportswear manufacturer adidas revealed that it was donating € 50,000 -lrb- $ 53,840 -rrb- to the national anti-doping agency to continue its fight to stamp out the use of banned substances in sports .
this is in addition to the € 5.5 million donated to the cause by the german government and the combined € 1 million collected from the 16 german states .
doping an explosive topic in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united germany still deals with shadows of the past .
the subject of doping is a sensitive one in germany , often conjuring up memories of the horrific scale of drug-taking by athletes in east germany , which only came to light after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the reunified germany has since had to deal with the spectre of doping after details of the east germany 's doping program sent shockwaves through the world of sport . even today , its infamous reputation for doping has n't been totally erased from the world of german sports .
in 1974 , the communist government of east germany turned to sports as a means of cleaning up its image tarnished by widely publicized pictures of people dying in their attempts to reach the free west .
east german officials decided to turn their nation into a sporting superpower , fighting the cold war inside sports stadiums across the globe .
that shift in policy marked the beginning of an unprecedented systematic doping campaign , which involved pumping budding atletes and top sports stars with an array of performance-enhancing drugs , often without their knowledge .

with the goal being victory at any cost , officials began giving oral turinabol , a powerful performance-enhancing steroid to all competing athletes , including children as young as 10 years old , telling the athletes the little blue pills were vitamins .
elite athletes were taken to a highly secure sports institute where they were tested in laboratory-like conditions .
researchers at the institute even calculated how long it took for the steroids to pass through the athletes ’ bodies , so as to ensure that the steroids could be stopped in time to test clean for competitions .
" i can remember getting 10 tables at a time , 30 a day , " carola nitschke , the east german athlete who broke the world breaststroke record when she was 14 years old , said in an interview with abc news in 2001 .

the doping program , called state plan 14.25 , continued until 1989 .
after east germany and west germany united in 1990 , the west appointed a committee to investigate the activities of east german scientists .

as cologne gears up for its annual party ritual when millions of visitors descend upon the city for the karneval , local businesses are rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of big profits . germany ’ s karneval celebrations are a mighty force , and that ’ s not just taking into consideration the sights , sounds , and general debauchery - though they certainly are noteworthy .
the festivities also pack a considerable economic punch , at least in germany 's bigger cities . in cologne , karneval central , millions jam the streets for one of the biggest open-air celebrations in the world .
they ’ re not only party animals , but power consumers too - of hotel rooms , taxi trips , costumes and , of course , alcohol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karneval brings big bucks estimates vary about the exact amount of cash that karneval visitors bring to the city .
the association of german karneval estimates that karneval revelers bring over a billion euro to a city like cologne alone every year . the numbers are telling : 3,000 karneval-related jobs , 100,000 trips to the hairdresser , 300,000 costumes , and 450,000 taxi trips .
and these are just the old figures - the city of cologne hasn ’ t updated them in years .
one can only imagine what they might be like today : “ you couldn ’ t give me a high enough estimate , ” cologne spokesman josef sommer told dw-radio .
“ surely we get over 3 million visitors a year . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the saying may go , “ every jester is different ” -lrb- in this case , referring to the many who dress up like jesters and clowns during the festivities -rrb- , but that ’ s not true when you look at their spending habits . according to the latest figures compiled by ‘ großen kölner 1883 ’ , a local paper , the average person spends about € 160 -lrb- $ 173 -rrb- on drinks , food , and souvenirs .
multiply that by 3 million revellers , and that translates into € 48 million . costs of pulling off karneval considerably high out of that about € 25,5 million are then pooled right back into the festivities as the money gets distributed among the city ’ s some 105 historic karneval associations . after all staging such a huge event also includes some rather significant costs .
though none in the city like to talk much about the entertainment costs of karneval , it 's a well-known fact that a major amount of the funds are swallowed by them . a professional comic-jester -lrb- “ büttenreder ” -rrb- , who is well-versed in the tradition of humorous rhyming rakes in € 1,300 euro for a mere fifteen minute performance , while a popular music group costs around € 2,200 euro . the karneval associations , which begin to prepare for the karneval from the end of the previous season , also have other costs to bear : for instance when the old town stages its traditional “ weiberfastnacht ” celebrations - the “ night of the women ” or " women 's karneval " when the women have free reign to troll the city streets chopping off men ’ s ties . that 's when the associations need to dig deeper into their pockets and come up with € 21,000 for security , ambulances , toilets , garbage removal , and more .
it ’ s not unusual for some of the city 's bigger karneval associations to have an annual budget of € 500,000 . karneval paraphernalia selling like hot cakes one area where money is obviously not given a thought by hard-core karneval goers are costumes .
it 's estimated that they spend about € 30 million on costumes ranging from the outrageous to the downright bizarre .
and this is where the smaller businesses benefit the most . talk of a recession may dominate the headlines , but merchants say they haven ’ t felt the pinch .
“ we don ’ t feel it at all , ” says frank schröder , the manager of karnvalswierts , the city ’ s largest specialty store for carnival items .
“ precisely because things aren ’ t going so well with the economy , people - more than ever - are in the mood to party . ” in fact , schröder ’ s shop added an additional 550 qm of space and twelve additional cash registers , and , according to shröder , they ’ re only keeping up with demand .
what ’ s more , his 100 employees don ’ t find themselves idle during others times of year either : costumes aren ’ t just worn during the karneval , there ’ s also the christopher street day and the love parade .
parties - it seems - are big business year round . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as cologne gears up for its annual party ritual when millions of visitors descend upon the city for the karneval , local businesses are rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of big profits . germany ’ s karneval celebrations are a mighty force , and that ’ s not just taking into consideration the sights , sounds , and general debauchery - though they certainly are noteworthy .
the festivities also pack a considerable economic punch , at least in germany 's bigger cities . in cologne , karneval central , millions jam the streets for one of the biggest open-air celebrations in the world .
they ’ re not only party animals , but power consumers too - of hotel rooms , taxi trips , costumes and , of course , alcohol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karneval brings big bucks estimates vary about the exact amount of cash that karneval visitors bring to the city .
the association of german karneval estimates that karneval revelers bring over a billion euro to a city like cologne alone every year . the numbers are telling : 3,000 karneval-related jobs , 100,000 trips to the hairdresser , 300,000 costumes , and 450,000 taxi trips .
and these are just the old figures - the city of cologne hasn ’ t updated them in years .
one can only imagine what they might be like today : “ you couldn ’ t give me a high enough estimate , ” cologne spokesman josef sommer told dw-radio .
“ surely we get over 3 million visitors a year . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the saying may go , “ every jester is different ” -lrb- in this case , referring to the many who dress up like jesters and clowns during the festivities -rrb- , but that ’ s not true when you look at their spending habits . according to the latest figures compiled by ‘ großen kölner 1883 ’ , a local paper , the average person spends about € 160 -lrb- $ 173 -rrb- on drinks , food , and souvenirs .
multiply that by 3 million revellers , and that translates into € 48 million . costs of pulling off karneval considerably high out of that about € 25,5 million are then pooled right back into the festivities as the money gets distributed among the city ’ s some 105 historic karneval associations . after all staging such a huge event also includes some rather significant costs .
though none in the city like to talk much about the entertainment costs of karneval , it 's a well-known fact that a major amount of the funds are swallowed by them . a professional comic-jester -lrb- “ büttenreder ” -rrb- , who is well-versed in the tradition of humorous rhyming rakes in € 1,300 euro for a mere fifteen minute performance , while a popular music group costs around € 2,200 euro . the karneval associations , which begin to prepare for the karneval from the end of the previous season , also have other costs to bear : for instance when the old town stages its traditional “ weiberfastnacht ” celebrations - the “ night of the women ” or " women 's karneval " when the women have free reign to troll the city streets chopping off men ’ s ties . that 's when the associations need to dig deeper into their pockets and come up with € 21,000 for security , ambulances , toilets , garbage removal , and more .
it ’ s not unusual for some of the city 's bigger karneval associations to have an annual budget of € 500,000 . karneval paraphernalia selling like hot cakes one area where money is obviously not given a thought by hard-core karneval goers are costumes .
it 's estimated that they spend about € 30 million on costumes ranging from the outrageous to the downright bizarre .
and this is where the smaller businesses benefit the most . talk of a recession may dominate the headlines , but merchants say they haven ’ t felt the pinch .
“ we don ’ t feel it at all , ” says frank schröder , the manager of karnvalswierts , the city ’ s largest specialty store for carnival items .
“ precisely because things aren ’ t going so well with the economy , people - more than ever - are in the mood to party . ” in fact , schröder ’ s shop added an additional 550 qm of space and twelve additional cash registers , and , according to shröder , they ’ re only keeping up with demand .

doping figures for 2002 show that positive testing for banned drugs has remained constant over the past three years - a far cry from the alarming doping cases that emerged in east germany . the federal institute of sports sciences in bonn has released the annual report into the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in german sports .
in 2002 , a total of 56 positive results were recorded from tests carried out on 7,930 german athletes last year .
the number of positive tests remained consistent with previous results , which suggests that the number of identified doping incidents has reached a plateau .
in 2001 , 44 people tested positive for banned substances from a total of 7,831 people , while in 2000 it was 55 out of 8,255 sports people , who failed the drug tests .
the news comes as german sportswear manufacturer adidas revealed that it was donating € 50,000 -lrb- $ 53,840 -rrb- to the national anti-doping agency to continue its fight to stamp out the use of banned substances in sports .
this is in addition to the € 5.5 million donated to the cause by the german government and the combined € 1 million collected from the 16 german states .
doping an explosive topic in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united germany still deals with shadows of the past .
the subject of doping is a sensitive one in germany , often conjuring up memories of the horrific scale of drug-taking by athletes in east germany , which only came to light after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the reunified germany has since had to deal with the spectre of doping after details of the east germany 's doping program sent shockwaves through the world of sport . even today , its infamous reputation for doping has n't been totally erased from the world of german sports .
in 1974 , the communist government of east germany turned to sports as a means of cleaning up its image tarnished by widely publicized pictures of people dying in their attempts to reach the free west .
east german officials decided to turn their nation into a sporting superpower , fighting the cold war inside sports stadiums across the globe .
that shift in policy marked the beginning of an unprecedented systematic doping campaign , which involved pumping budding atletes and top sports stars with an array of performance-enhancing drugs , often without their knowledge .
east german bid for sports domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug testing in a laboratory .
with the goal being victory at any cost , officials began giving oral turinabol , a powerful performance-enhancing steroid to all competing athletes , including children as young as 10 years old , telling the athletes the little blue pills were vitamins .
elite athletes were taken to a highly secure sports institute where they were tested in laboratory-like conditions .
researchers at the institute even calculated how long it took for the steroids to pass through the athletes ’ bodies , so as to ensure that the steroids could be stopped in time to test clean for competitions .
" i can remember getting 10 tables at a time , 30 a day , " carola nitschke , the east german athlete who broke the world breaststroke record when she was 14 years old , said in an interview with abc news in 2001 .
nitschke 's testimony is one among thousands that came to light once the east german program was exposed .
the doping program , called state plan 14.25 , continued until 1989 .
after east germany and west germany united in 1990 , the west appointed a committee to investigate the activities of east german scientists .
research on the program , previously highly classified , were unearthed and showed that that virtually all of east german 's top champions had been doped under state plan 14.25 .
officials and doctors prosecuted however , despite overwhelming evidence , it took nearly 10 years before those responsible were brought to account .
the doctors and officials who were brought to trial and prosecuted , including manfred ewald , the former head of the east german gymnastics and sports federation , expressed regret and claimed their actions were forced upon them by east germany 's communist leaders .
their sentences were lenient ; most received suspended prison terms .

doping figures for 2002 show that positive testing for banned drugs has remained constant over the past three years - a far cry from the alarming doping cases that emerged in east germany . the federal institute of sports sciences in bonn has released the annual report into the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in german sports .
in 2002 , a total of 56 positive results were recorded from tests carried out on 7,930 german athletes last year .
the number of positive tests remained consistent with previous results , which suggests that the number of identified doping incidents has reached a plateau .
in 2001 , 44 people tested positive for banned substances from a total of 7,831 people , while in 2000 it was 55 out of 8,255 sports people , who failed the drug tests .
the news comes as german sportswear manufacturer adidas revealed that it was donating € 50,000 -lrb- $ 53,840 -rrb- to the national anti-doping agency to continue its fight to stamp out the use of banned substances in sports .
this is in addition to the € 5.5 million donated to the cause by the german government and the combined € 1 million collected from the 16 german states .
doping an explosive topic in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united germany still deals with shadows of the past .
the subject of doping is a sensitive one in germany , often conjuring up memories of the horrific scale of drug-taking by athletes in east germany , which only came to light after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the reunified germany has since had to deal with the spectre of doping after details of the east germany 's doping program sent shockwaves through the world of sport . even today , its infamous reputation for doping has n't been totally erased from the world of german sports .
in 1974 , the communist government of east germany turned to sports as a means of cleaning up its image tarnished by widely publicized pictures of people dying in their attempts to reach the free west .
east german officials decided to turn their nation into a sporting superpower , fighting the cold war inside sports stadiums across the globe .
that shift in policy marked the beginning of an unprecedented systematic doping campaign , which involved pumping budding atletes and top sports stars with an array of performance-enhancing drugs , often without their knowledge .
east german bid for sports domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug testing in a laboratory .
with the goal being victory at any cost , officials began giving oral turinabol , a powerful performance-enhancing steroid to all competing athletes , including children as young as 10 years old , telling the athletes the little blue pills were vitamins .
elite athletes were taken to a highly secure sports institute where they were tested in laboratory-like conditions .
researchers at the institute even calculated how long it took for the steroids to pass through the athletes ’ bodies , so as to ensure that the steroids could be stopped in time to test clean for competitions .
" i can remember getting 10 tables at a time , 30 a day , " carola nitschke , the east german athlete who broke the world breaststroke record when she was 14 years old , said in an interview with abc news in 2001 .
nitschke 's testimony is one among thousands that came to light once the east german program was exposed .
the doping program , called state plan 14.25 , continued until 1989 .
after east germany and west germany united in 1990 , the west appointed a committee to investigate the activities of east german scientists .
research on the program , previously highly classified , were unearthed and showed that that virtually all of east german 's top champions had been doped under state plan 14.25 .
officials and doctors prosecuted however , despite overwhelming evidence , it took nearly 10 years before those responsible were brought to account .
the doctors and officials who were brought to trial and prosecuted , including manfred ewald , the former head of the east german gymnastics and sports federation , expressed regret and claimed their actions were forced upon them by east germany 's communist leaders .
their sentences were lenient ; most received suspended prison terms .

as cologne gears up for its annual party ritual when millions of visitors descend upon the city for the karneval , local businesses are rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of big profits . germany ’ s karneval celebrations are a mighty force , and that ’ s not just taking into consideration the sights , sounds , and general debauchery - though they certainly are noteworthy .
the festivities also pack a considerable economic punch , at least in germany 's bigger cities . in cologne , karneval central , millions jam the streets for one of the biggest open-air celebrations in the world .
they ’ re not only party animals , but power consumers too - of hotel rooms , taxi trips , costumes and , of course , alcohol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karneval brings big bucks estimates vary about the exact amount of cash that karneval visitors bring to the city .
the association of german karneval estimates that karneval revelers bring over a billion euro to a city like cologne alone every year . the numbers are telling : 3,000 karneval-related jobs , 100,000 trips to the hairdresser , 300,000 costumes , and 450,000 taxi trips .
and these are just the old figures - the city of cologne hasn ’ t updated them in years .
one can only imagine what they might be like today : “ you couldn ’ t give me a high enough estimate , ” cologne spokesman josef sommer told dw-radio .
“ surely we get over 3 million visitors a year . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the saying may go , “ every jester is different ” -lrb- in this case , referring to the many who dress up like jesters and clowns during the festivities -rrb- , but that ’ s not true when you look at their spending habits . according to the latest figures compiled by ‘ großen kölner 1883 ’ , a local paper , the average person spends about € 160 -lrb- $ 173 -rrb- on drinks , food , and souvenirs .
multiply that by 3 million revellers , and that translates into € 48 million . costs of pulling off karneval considerably high out of that about € 25,5 million are then pooled right back into the festivities as the money gets distributed among the city ’ s some 105 historic karneval associations . after all staging such a huge event also includes some rather significant costs .
though none in the city like to talk much about the entertainment costs of karneval , it 's a well-known fact that a major amount of the funds are swallowed by them . a professional comic-jester -lrb- “ büttenreder ” -rrb- , who is well-versed in the tradition of humorous rhyming rakes in € 1,300 euro for a mere fifteen minute performance , while a popular music group costs around € 2,200 euro . the karneval associations , which begin to prepare for the karneval from the end of the previous season , also have other costs to bear : for instance when the old town stages its traditional “ weiberfastnacht ” celebrations - the “ night of the women ” or " women 's karneval " when the women have free reign to troll the city streets chopping off men ’ s ties . that 's when the associations need to dig deeper into their pockets and come up with € 21,000 for security , ambulances , toilets , garbage removal , and more .
it ’ s not unusual for some of the city 's bigger karneval associations to have an annual budget of € 500,000 . karneval paraphernalia selling like hot cakes one area where money is obviously not given a thought by hard-core karneval goers are costumes .
it 's estimated that they spend about € 30 million on costumes ranging from the outrageous to the downright bizarre .
and this is where the smaller businesses benefit the most . talk of a recession may dominate the headlines , but merchants say they haven ’ t felt the pinch .
“ we don ’ t feel it at all , ” says frank schröder , the manager of karnvalswierts , the city ’ s largest specialty store for carnival items .
“ precisely because things aren ’ t going so well with the economy , people - more than ever - are in the mood to party . ” in fact , schröder ’ s shop added an additional 550 qm of space and twelve additional cash registers , and , according to shröder , they ’ re only keeping up with demand .
what ’ s more , his 100 employees don ’ t find themselves idle during others times of year either : costumes aren ’ t just worn during the karneval , there ’ s also the christopher street day and the love parade .
parties - it seems - are big business year round . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as cologne gears up for its annual party ritual when millions of visitors descend upon the city for the karneval , local businesses are rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of big profits . germany ’ s karneval celebrations are a mighty force , and that ’ s not just taking into consideration the sights , sounds , and general debauchery - though they certainly are noteworthy .
the festivities also pack a considerable economic punch , at least in germany 's bigger cities . in cologne , karneval central , millions jam the streets for one of the biggest open-air celebrations in the world .
they ’ re not only party animals , but power consumers too - of hotel rooms , taxi trips , costumes and , of course , alcohol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karneval brings big bucks estimates vary about the exact amount of cash that karneval visitors bring to the city .
the association of german karneval estimates that karneval revelers bring over a billion euro to a city like cologne alone every year . the numbers are telling : 3,000 karneval-related jobs , 100,000 trips to the hairdresser , 300,000 costumes , and 450,000 taxi trips .
and these are just the old figures - the city of cologne hasn ’ t updated them in years .
one can only imagine what they might be like today : “ you couldn ’ t give me a high enough estimate , ” cologne spokesman josef sommer told dw-radio .
“ surely we get over 3 million visitors a year . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the saying may go , “ every jester is different ” -lrb- in this case , referring to the many who dress up like jesters and clowns during the festivities -rrb- , but that ’ s not true when you look at their spending habits . according to the latest figures compiled by ‘ großen kölner 1883 ’ , a local paper , the average person spends about € 160 -lrb- $ 173 -rrb- on drinks , food , and souvenirs .
multiply that by 3 million revellers , and that translates into € 48 million . costs of pulling off karneval considerably high out of that about € 25,5 million are then pooled right back into the festivities as the money gets distributed among the city ’ s some 105 historic karneval associations . after all staging such a huge event also includes some rather significant costs .
though none in the city like to talk much about the entertainment costs of karneval , it 's a well-known fact that a major amount of the funds are swallowed by them . a professional comic-jester -lrb- “ büttenreder ” -rrb- , who is well-versed in the tradition of humorous rhyming rakes in € 1,300 euro for a mere fifteen minute performance , while a popular music group costs around € 2,200 euro . the karneval associations , which begin to prepare for the karneval from the end of the previous season , also have other costs to bear : for instance when the old town stages its traditional “ weiberfastnacht ” celebrations - the “ night of the women ” or " women 's karneval " when the women have free reign to troll the city streets chopping off men ’ s ties . that 's when the associations need to dig deeper into their pockets and come up with € 21,000 for security , ambulances , toilets , garbage removal , and more .
it ’ s not unusual for some of the city 's bigger karneval associations to have an annual budget of € 500,000 . karneval paraphernalia selling like hot cakes one area where money is obviously not given a thought by hard-core karneval goers are costumes .
it 's estimated that they spend about € 30 million on costumes ranging from the outrageous to the downright bizarre .
and this is where the smaller businesses benefit the most . talk of a recession may dominate the headlines , but merchants say they haven ’ t felt the pinch .
“ we don ’ t feel it at all , ” says frank schröder , the manager of karnvalswierts , the city ’ s largest specialty store for carnival items .
“ precisely because things aren ’ t going so well with the economy , people - more than ever - are in the mood to party . ” in fact , schröder ’ s shop added an additional 550 qm of space and twelve additional cash registers , and , according to shröder , they ’ re only keeping up with demand .

doping figures for 2002 show that positive testing for banned drugs has remained constant over the past three years - a far cry from the alarming doping cases that emerged in east germany . the federal institute of sports sciences in bonn has released the annual report into the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in german sports .
in 2002 , a total of 56 positive results were recorded from tests carried out on 7,930 german athletes last year .
the number of positive tests remained consistent with previous results , which suggests that the number of identified doping incidents has reached a plateau .
in 2001 , 44 people tested positive for banned substances from a total of 7,831 people , while in 2000 it was 55 out of 8,255 sports people , who failed the drug tests .
the news comes as german sportswear manufacturer adidas revealed that it was donating € 50,000 -lrb- $ 53,840 -rrb- to the national anti-doping agency to continue its fight to stamp out the use of banned substances in sports .
this is in addition to the € 5.5 million donated to the cause by the german government and the combined € 1 million collected from the 16 german states .
doping an explosive topic in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united germany still deals with shadows of the past .
the subject of doping is a sensitive one in germany , often conjuring up memories of the horrific scale of drug-taking by athletes in east germany , which only came to light after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the reunified germany has since had to deal with the spectre of doping after details of the east germany 's doping program sent shockwaves through the world of sport . even today , its infamous reputation for doping has n't been totally erased from the world of german sports .
in 1974 , the communist government of east germany turned to sports as a means of cleaning up its image tarnished by widely publicized pictures of people dying in their attempts to reach the free west .
east german officials decided to turn their nation into a sporting superpower , fighting the cold war inside sports stadiums across the globe .
that shift in policy marked the beginning of an unprecedented systematic doping campaign , which involved pumping budding atletes and top sports stars with an array of performance-enhancing drugs , often without their knowledge .
east german bid for sports domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug testing in a laboratory .
with the goal being victory at any cost , officials began giving oral turinabol , a powerful performance-enhancing steroid to all competing athletes , including children as young as 10 years old , telling the athletes the little blue pills were vitamins .
elite athletes were taken to a highly secure sports institute where they were tested in laboratory-like conditions .
researchers at the institute even calculated how long it took for the steroids to pass through the athletes ’ bodies , so as to ensure that the steroids could be stopped in time to test clean for competitions .
" i can remember getting 10 tables at a time , 30 a day , " carola nitschke , the east german athlete who broke the world breaststroke record when she was 14 years old , said in an interview with abc news in 2001 .
nitschke 's testimony is one among thousands that came to light once the east german program was exposed .
the doping program , called state plan 14.25 , continued until 1989 .
after east germany and west germany united in 1990 , the west appointed a committee to investigate the activities of east german scientists .
research on the program , previously highly classified , were unearthed and showed that that virtually all of east german 's top champions had been doped under state plan 14.25 .
officials and doctors prosecuted however , despite overwhelming evidence , it took nearly 10 years before those responsible were brought to account .
the doctors and officials who were brought to trial and prosecuted , including manfred ewald , the former head of the east german gymnastics and sports federation , expressed regret and claimed their actions were forced upon them by east germany 's communist leaders .
their sentences were lenient ; most received suspended prison terms .

doping figures for 2002 show that positive testing for banned drugs has remained constant over the past three years - a far cry from the alarming doping cases that emerged in east germany . the federal institute of sports sciences in bonn has released the annual report into the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in german sports .
in 2002 , a total of 56 positive results were recorded from tests carried out on 7,930 german athletes last year .
the number of positive tests remained consistent with previous results , which suggests that the number of identified doping incidents has reached a plateau .
in 2001 , 44 people tested positive for banned substances from a total of 7,831 people , while in 2000 it was 55 out of 8,255 sports people , who failed the drug tests .
the news comes as german sportswear manufacturer adidas revealed that it was donating € 50,000 -lrb- $ 53,840 -rrb- to the national anti-doping agency to continue its fight to stamp out the use of banned substances in sports .
this is in addition to the € 5.5 million donated to the cause by the german government and the combined € 1 million collected from the 16 german states .
doping an explosive topic in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united germany still deals with shadows of the past .
the subject of doping is a sensitive one in germany , often conjuring up memories of the horrific scale of drug-taking by athletes in east germany , which only came to light after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the reunified germany has since had to deal with the spectre of doping after details of the east germany 's doping program sent shockwaves through the world of sport . even today , its infamous reputation for doping has n't been totally erased from the world of german sports .
in 1974 , the communist government of east germany turned to sports as a means of cleaning up its image tarnished by widely publicized pictures of people dying in their attempts to reach the free west .
east german officials decided to turn their nation into a sporting superpower , fighting the cold war inside sports stadiums across the globe .
that shift in policy marked the beginning of an unprecedented systematic doping campaign , which involved pumping budding atletes and top sports stars with an array of performance-enhancing drugs , often without their knowledge .
east german bid for sports domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug testing in a laboratory .
with the goal being victory at any cost , officials began giving oral turinabol , a powerful performance-enhancing steroid to all competing athletes , including children as young as 10 years old , telling the athletes the little blue pills were vitamins .
elite athletes were taken to a highly secure sports institute where they were tested in laboratory-like conditions .
researchers at the institute even calculated how long it took for the steroids to pass through the athletes ’ bodies , so as to ensure that the steroids could be stopped in time to test clean for competitions .
" i can remember getting 10 tables at a time , 30 a day , " carola nitschke , the east german athlete who broke the world breaststroke record when she was 14 years old , said in an interview with abc news in 2001 .
nitschke 's testimony is one among thousands that came to light once the east german program was exposed .
the doping program , called state plan 14.25 , continued until 1989 .
after east germany and west germany united in 1990 , the west appointed a committee to investigate the activities of east german scientists .
research on the program , previously highly classified , were unearthed and showed that that virtually all of east german 's top champions had been doped under state plan 14.25 .
officials and doctors prosecuted however , despite overwhelming evidence , it took nearly 10 years before those responsible were brought to account .
the doctors and officials who were brought to trial and prosecuted , including manfred ewald , the former head of the east german gymnastics and sports federation , expressed regret and claimed their actions were forced upon them by east germany 's communist leaders .
their sentences were lenient ; most received suspended prison terms .

as cologne gears up for its annual party ritual when millions of visitors descend upon the city for the karneval , local businesses are rubbing their hands in glee at the thought of big profits . germany ’ s karneval celebrations are a mighty force , and that ’ s not just taking into consideration the sights , sounds , and general debauchery - though they certainly are noteworthy .
the festivities also pack a considerable economic punch , at least in germany 's bigger cities . in cologne , karneval central , millions jam the streets for one of the biggest open-air celebrations in the world .
they ’ re not only party animals , but power consumers too - of hotel rooms , taxi trips , costumes and , of course , alcohol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karneval brings big bucks estimates vary about the exact amount of cash that karneval visitors bring to the city .
the association of german karneval estimates that karneval revelers bring over a billion euro to a city like cologne alone every year . the numbers are telling : 3,000 karneval-related jobs , 100,000 trips to the hairdresser , 300,000 costumes , and 450,000 taxi trips .
and these are just the old figures - the city of cologne hasn ’ t updated them in years .
one can only imagine what they might be like today : “ you couldn ’ t give me a high enough estimate , ” cologne spokesman josef sommer told dw-radio .
“ surely we get over 3 million visitors a year . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the saying may go , “ every jester is different ” -lrb- in this case , referring to the many who dress up like jesters and clowns during the festivities -rrb- , but that ’ s not true when you look at their spending habits . according to the latest figures compiled by ‘ großen kölner 1883 ’ , a local paper , the average person spends about € 160 -lrb- $ 173 -rrb- on drinks , food , and souvenirs .
multiply that by 3 million revellers , and that translates into € 48 million . costs of pulling off karneval considerably high out of that about € 25,5 million are then pooled right back into the festivities as the money gets distributed among the city ’ s some 105 historic karneval associations . after all staging such a huge event also includes some rather significant costs .
though none in the city like to talk much about the entertainment costs of karneval , it 's a well-known fact that a major amount of the funds are swallowed by them . a professional comic-jester -lrb- “ büttenreder ” -rrb- , who is well-versed in the tradition of humorous rhyming rakes in € 1,300 euro for a mere fifteen minute performance , while a popular music group costs around € 2,200 euro . the karneval associations , which begin to prepare for the karneval from the end of the previous season , also have other costs to bear : for instance when the old town stages its traditional “ weiberfastnacht ” celebrations - the “ night of the women ” or " women 's karneval " when the women have free reign to troll the city streets chopping off men ’ s ties . that 's when the associations need to dig deeper into their pockets and come up with € 21,000 for security , ambulances , toilets , garbage removal , and more .
it ’ s not unusual for some of the city 's bigger karneval associations to have an annual budget of € 500,000 . karneval paraphernalia selling like hot cakes one area where money is obviously not given a thought by hard-core karneval goers are costumes .
it 's estimated that they spend about € 30 million on costumes ranging from the outrageous to the downright bizarre .
and this is where the smaller businesses benefit the most . talk of a recession may dominate the headlines , but merchants say they haven ’ t felt the pinch .
“ we don ’ t feel it at all , ” says frank schröder , the manager of karnvalswierts , the city ’ s largest specialty store for carnival items .
“ precisely because things aren ’ t going so well with the economy , people - more than ever - are in the mood to party . ” in fact , schröder ’ s shop added an additional 550 qm of space and twelve additional cash registers , and , according to shröder , they ’ re only keeping up with demand .
what ’ s more , his 100 employees don ’ t find themselves idle during others times of year either : costumes aren ’ t just worn during the karneval , there ’ s also the christopher street day and the love parade .
parties - it seems - are big business year round . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

doping figures for 2002 show that positive testing for banned drugs has remained constant over the past three years - a far cry from the alarming doping cases that emerged in east germany . the federal institute of sports sciences in bonn has released the annual report into the use of illegal performance enhancing substances in german sports .
in 2002 , a total of 56 positive results were recorded from tests carried out on 7,930 german athletes last year .
the number of positive tests remained consistent with previous results , which suggests that the number of identified doping incidents has reached a plateau .
in 2001 , 44 people tested positive for banned substances from a total of 7,831 people , while in 2000 it was 55 out of 8,255 sports people , who failed the drug tests .
the news comes as german sportswear manufacturer adidas revealed that it was donating € 50,000 -lrb- $ 53,840 -rrb- to the national anti-doping agency to continue its fight to stamp out the use of banned substances in sports .
this is in addition to the € 5.5 million donated to the cause by the german government and the combined € 1 million collected from the 16 german states .
doping an explosive topic in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united germany still deals with shadows of the past .
the subject of doping is a sensitive one in germany , often conjuring up memories of the horrific scale of drug-taking by athletes in east germany , which only came to light after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 .
the reunified germany has since had to deal with the spectre of doping after details of the east germany 's doping program sent shockwaves through the world of sport . even today , its infamous reputation for doping has n't been totally erased from the world of german sports .
in 1974 , the communist government of east germany turned to sports as a means of cleaning up its image tarnished by widely publicized pictures of people dying in their attempts to reach the free west .
east german officials decided to turn their nation into a sporting superpower , fighting the cold war inside sports stadiums across the globe .
that shift in policy marked the beginning of an unprecedented systematic doping campaign , which involved pumping budding atletes and top sports stars with an array of performance-enhancing drugs , often without their knowledge .
east german bid for sports domination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drug testing in a laboratory .
with the goal being victory at any cost , officials began giving oral turinabol , a powerful performance-enhancing steroid to all competing athletes , including children as young as 10 years old , telling the athletes the little blue pills were vitamins .
elite athletes were taken to a highly secure sports institute where they were tested in laboratory-like conditions .
researchers at the institute even calculated how long it took for the steroids to pass through the athletes ’ bodies , so as to ensure that the steroids could be stopped in time to test clean for competitions .
" i can remember getting 10 tables at a time , 30 a day , " carola nitschke , the east german athlete who broke the world breaststroke record when she was 14 years old , said in an interview with abc news in 2001 .
nitschke 's testimony is one among thousands that came to light once the east german program was exposed .
the doping program , called state plan 14.25 , continued until 1989 .
after east germany and west germany united in 1990 , the west appointed a committee to investigate the activities of east german scientists .
research on the program , previously highly classified , were unearthed and showed that that virtually all of east german 's top champions had been doped under state plan 14.25 .
officials and doctors prosecuted however , despite overwhelming evidence , it took nearly 10 years before those responsible were brought to account .
the doctors and officials who were brought to trial and prosecuted , including manfred ewald , the former head of the east german gymnastics and sports federation , expressed regret and claimed their actions were forced upon them by east germany 's communist leaders .
their sentences were lenient ; most received suspended prison terms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former east german swimming stars and victims of state plan 14.25 today the institute of sports sciences and the anti-doping agency work to keep german sports doping free .
but unfortunately it may be too late to completely erase the dark legacy of the east german doping problem .
those athletes involved in state plan 14.25 continue to live with the severe health problems that come with extensive steroid use - heart and liver problems , growth defects and gynaecological problems - and fight for compensation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putting the lid on doping germany is ramping up its battle against performance enhancing drugs by setting up a national anti-doping agency .
both politicians and sports organizations hope the move will eliminate the use of steroids by athletes .

the exclusive interview was saddam 's first with a us journalist for many years .
on possible exile : iraqi leader 's interview all i am asking is to appear before the american people saddam hussein click here to watch rather : " mr president , have you been offered asylum anywhere ?
and would you , under any circumstances , consider going into exile to save your people death and destruction ? "
saddam : " i was born here in iraq ...
i am proud to have been born fearing god and i have taught my children the value of history and the value of human stands ...
whoever decides to forsake his nation from whoever requests is not true to the principles .
" we will die here .
we will die in this country and we will maintain our honour - the honour that is required ... in front of our people .
i believe that whoever ... offers saddam asylum in his own country is in fact a person without morals . "
on iraq 's oil fields : rather : " if there is an invasion , will you set fire to the oil fields ?
will you blow the dams or your reservoirs of water to resist the invasion ? "
saddam : " i 've answered the hypothesis , but to indulge in the details : iraq does not burn its wealth and it does not destroy its dams .
" we hope that , however , that this question is not meant as an insinuation , so that the iraqi dams and the iraqi oil wells will be destroyed by those who will invade iraq in their possible invasion of the country ... "
on al-qaeda : rather : " mr president , americans are very much concerned about anyone 's connections to osama bin laden .
do you have , have you had , any connections to al-qaeda and osama bin laden ? "
saddam : " ...
iraq has never had any relationship with al-qaeda and i think that mr bin laden himself has recently , in one of his speeches , given such an answer that we have no relation with him . "
on the al-samoud missiles and a debate with president bush : rather : " mr president , do you intend to destroy the al-samoud missiles that the united nations prohibits ?
will you destroy those missiles ? "
saddam : " our commitment is to abide , to comply with the resolution and to apply it as per the will of the united nations and on that basis we have acted and we shall act .
" as you know , iraq is allowed to manufacture land-to-land rockets as per the resolution of the united nations . "
rather : " i want to make sure you understand , mr president .
you do not intend to destroy these missiles ? "
saddam : " which missiles ?
what do you mean ?
we have no missiles outside the specifications of the united nations and the inspection teams are here and they 're looking .
" i believe the united states knows and the world knows that iraq has none of what has been said at the higher political levels .
" and i believe all the turmoil that 's going on and all these fleets and these concentrations of troops , all this is to cover the big lie that iraq has weapons of mass destruction such as biological , chemical and nuclear weapons .
" so , the missiles you are talking about , the missiles that are against the resolution of the united nations , these do not exist and they have been destroyed . "
rather : " what is the most important thing you want the american people to understand at this important juncture of history ? "
saddam : " first , that you tell them that iraqi people are not the enemy of the american people .
" if the american people want to know more through dialogue through television screens , i am ready to dialogue with bush , with mr bush , the president of the united states , and to appear together before the television .
" and i would say what i have to say , what i have to say about the american policy and he can say things about the iraqi policy and let that be on television in a just and fair way . "
rather : " are you speaking of a debate ?
yes , a debate .
this is new .
you are saying that you are willing , you are suggesting , you are urging a debate with president bush on television ? "
saddam : " yes , that 's it .
we are not asking for a contest with weapons .
all i 'm asking is to appear before the american people and other people in a direct discussion in a conversation between me and mr bush that 's broadcast by television .
" this is an opportunity for him , if he is really convinced about his position , about preparations for war , or any other means , to convince the whole world about the reasons that justifies war .
" and it 's opportunity for us to tell the world about our reasons to want to live in peace . "
rather : " this is not a joke ? "
saddam : " not at all .

the exclusive interview was saddam 's first with a us journalist for many years .
on possible exile : iraqi leader 's interview all i am asking is to appear before the american people saddam hussein click here to watch rather : " mr president , have you been offered asylum anywhere ?
and would you , under any circumstances , consider going into exile to save your people death and destruction ? "
saddam : " i was born here in iraq ...
i am proud to have been born fearing god and i have taught my children the value of history and the value of human stands ...
whoever decides to forsake his nation from whoever requests is not true to the principles .
" we will die here .
we will die in this country and we will maintain our honour - the honour that is required ... in front of our people .
i believe that whoever ... offers saddam asylum in his own country is in fact a person without morals . "
on iraq 's oil fields : rather : " if there is an invasion , will you set fire to the oil fields ?
will you blow the dams or your reservoirs of water to resist the invasion ? "
saddam : " i 've answered the hypothesis , but to indulge in the details : iraq does not burn its wealth and it does not destroy its dams .
" we hope that , however , that this question is not meant as an insinuation , so that the iraqi dams and the iraqi oil wells will be destroyed by those who will invade iraq in their possible invasion of the country ... "
on al-qaeda : rather : " mr president , americans are very much concerned about anyone 's connections to osama bin laden .
do you have , have you had , any connections to al-qaeda and osama bin laden ? "

what do you mean ?
we have no missiles outside the specifications of the united nations and the inspection teams are here and they 're looking .
" i believe the united states knows and the world knows that iraq has none of what has been said at the higher political levels .
" and i believe all the turmoil that 's going on and all these fleets and these concentrations of troops , all this is to cover the big lie that iraq has weapons of mass destruction such as biological , chemical and nuclear weapons .
" so , the missiles you are talking about , the missiles that are against the resolution of the united nations , these do not exist and they have been destroyed . "
rather : " what is the most important thing you want the american people to understand at this important juncture of history ? "
saddam : " first , that you tell them that iraqi people are not the enemy of the american people .

yes , a debate .
this is new .
you are saying that you are willing , you are suggesting , you are urging a debate with president bush on television ? "

" this is an opportunity for him , if he is really convinced about his position , about preparations for war , or any other means , to convince the whole world about the reasons that justifies war .
" and it 's opportunity for us to tell the world about our reasons to want to live in peace . "
rather : " this is not a joke ? "
saddam : " not at all .

" this is an opportunity for him , if he is really convinced about his position , about preparations for war , or any other means , to convince the whole world about the reasons that justifies war .
" and it 's opportunity for us to tell the world about our reasons to want to live in peace . "
rather : " this is not a joke ? "
saddam : " not at all .
i 'm not joking .
this is because of my respect for the american public opinion .
conducting a dialogue could bring peace .
why not go and have a debate ? "
