pop stars have added glamour to the playstation show playstation 2 is more than just a collection of components in a black case .
for more than 53 million consumers around the world it is an alluring brand .
the success of the playstation brand is one of the key reasons sony continues to be the global market leader , and why microsoft 's xbox , with ostensibly the more powerful machines , languishes in a distant second place .
the playstation experience , at earl 's court in london , is part of sony 's continued efforts to keep brand awareness alive , even as its ps2 machines starts to enter the final few years of its sales cycle .
' lifestyle choice ' david wilson , head of press and public relations for sony computer entertainment europe , said the show was not just about selling and playing games but also about the " playstation lifestyle " .
sony explains why the playstation is so popular he said : " branding is key .
it 's about the experience of the playstation lifestyle .
it 's not just about gaming .
" it 's all the associated lifestyle elements that people associate with playstation gamers .
" when we entered into the market it was dominated by sega and nintendo .
the market was perceived as gaming for kids , a gaming ghetto for kids .
" from the outset what differentiated the playstation and helped us get market leadership was that we have always been about being an intrinsic part of a young person 's lifestyle . "
the event gives consumers hands-on time with the games they will be buying in the coming six months .
stars of the show are undoubtedly high-profile racer gran turismo 4 and football game pro evolution soccer 3 .
but the show is a world away from the games arcades of the 1980s .
instead of cold , dark , intimidating rooms with rows of games machines , the playstation experience is a dazzling white space , filled with soft seats and plasma screens .
wider appeal " we felt time was right to do a proper consumer show .
in the past it was about box shifting and selling things , " said mr wilson .
latest in gran turismo sequel on show " we have tried to take a trade show ethos and let people sample games that wo n't be out until christmas . "
the show is about fun and gaming , said mr wilson .
" we 've never said ' fun ' before , " he said , referring to the new branding of playstation .
" it was always an emotive word that somehow devalued the products .
but nowadays we have reached 53 million worldwide and now we feel we can use the word . "
it may be a simple thing , but sony knows if it wants to maintain its market leadership then it has to appeal to as wide a range of consumers as possible .
the launch of its webcam-style peripheral eyetoy , which is selling extremely well , points to a more inclusive marketing effort .
so expect women , the over 30-year-olds , families and couples to be lured into the playstation world in the next 12 months .

all ages perindopril belongs to a class of drugs called ace inhibitors which work by blocking the production of angiotensin ii , a protein which makes blood vessels constrict .
the european trial on reduction of cardiac events -lrb- europa study -rrb- gave half of those taking part 8 mg of perindopril once daily or a dummy pill in addition to their existing medication , such as aspirin , statins and beta-blockers , for an average of four years .

drax 's creditors opted to support international power , after the uk power generator revised its bid on friday .
the agreement sees off offers from us investment bank goldman sachs , mining firm bhp billiton and investment firm miller , mcconville , christen , hutchison & waffel -lrb- mmc -rrb- .
drax has been trying to restructure its finances since last year , when it was pitched into financial crisis by the collapse of txu europe , its biggest customer .
aes , the us utility that owned drax , effectively abandoned the plant at the beginning of august after banks refused to accept its financial restructuring offer .
quick thinking the key for international power 's rapid victory in the four-way race for drax was paying a higher price for some of the plant 's debt .
the overall size of its bid , however , remains a maximum £ 130m -lrb- $ 205m -rrb- , and the deal will give international power a stake of up to 38 % in drax .
the speedy provisional resolution of the drax sale has taken many observers by surprise .
mmc , for example , only entered the race on friday .
and it had seemed that the offers on the table were so complex - involving various mixes of shares and debt , and differing proposals for the future of the plant - that it could take a long time to secure agreement .

they include opening hours at the library at the forum and the problem of heavy glass doors at the entrance to the children 's library .

" it may well be that a positive way forward with this is to seek the views of the people of norwich and norfolk on how the forum works for them - and how things might be improved in the future . "
the forum , designed by sir norman foster , was funded by a £ 31.5m grant from the millennium commission , with matching support from norfolk county council and norwich city council .
