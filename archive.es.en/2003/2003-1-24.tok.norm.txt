the influential early 80 ’ s german electro-punk duo deutsch-amerikanische freundschaft are back with a new album .
but they aren ’ t feeling quite as friendly this time around . in the early 1980 ’ s , deutsch-amerikanische freundschaft was the highly controversial electro-punk bank heading up the roster of the " new german wave " of politically-motivated rock bands . after a period of silence , daf- german-american friendship - is back with a new cd .
and although the band ’ s name remains the same , gabi delgado-lopez and robert gröl 's lyrics tell an increasingly anti-american tale . thumbing its nose at washington seems to be one of the duo ’ s favorite pastimes - one that can be heard often on the new cd , " 15 neue daf lieder " -lrb- 15 new daf songs -rrb- , which hits german store shelves on feb .
24 . the band still maintains its distinctive electro-punk edge on the album , which takes specific aim at american cultural imperialism and political dominance with wicked precision . " the sheriff - an anti-american song " the first single to be relased from the album , “ der sheriff - ein anti-amerikanishes lied ” -lrb- the sheriff – an anti-american song -rrb- is a direct reference to u.s president george w. bush and the war against terror he is spearheading .
the song , slated for release on feb .
10 , includes the chorus line : when the sheriff goes riding , everyone goes riding with him ; everyone must bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : respect what the sheriff says ; everyone must accept what the sheriff does . the sheriff is a godly man ; he knows the bible ; when he kills an egg thief ; everyone helps him out ; everyone must grasp who the sheriff is . “ our sheriff is bush , ” delgado-lopez told dw-world in a phone interview .
“ he 's an evil father figure who bashes all around him .
he is a figure of american cultural imperialism and political dominance - something that many , many people have had enough of . ” his partner in song , gröl , chimes in : " bush ’ s plans for a war against iraq are utterly shitty , to be frank .
the man has no interest in diplomacy , and if the war takes place , it will be an act of revenge more than anything else . " but daf 's mainstream record label , universal , is seeking a more soothing tone in its efforts to market the album .
" i would n't say the songs are particularly anti-american , " spokesman bob bierekoven told dw-world .
" they are more anti-bush and his policies and certainly are n't against the country or its people . " making german punk history görl , now 47 , and delgado-lopez , 45 , formed the band in 1978 after meeting at düsseldorf 's now legendary ratinger hof nightclub . they “ clicked immediately , ” according to gröl and decided then and there to form daf - a radical band for its time .
gröl would write the songs and play the synthesizer and drums while delgado-lopez , who is spanish , sang .
their name , they said , was ironic , referring to a period in post-war west german history when american influence was paramount . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de watching the buildings collapse online einstürzende neubauten , germany ’ s best known industrial rock band , has turned to the internet to control production and distribution of its newest work .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .

but banking authorities remain pleased with the low level of fraud during the currency 's ingaural year . after six months of down time , europe 's counterfeiters appear to be active once again , according to annual figures released this week by the european central bank .
in a short report documenting counterfeiting in the 12 countries that use the euro , the frankfurt-based bank reported that a total of 145,153 counterfeit notes were removed from circulation in the second half of 2002 .
the number marked a dramatic jump from the 21,965 notes seized in the first half of last year .
" it takes awhile , " ecb spokesman jean rodriguez said of the jump .
" during the first half we had an extremely low number of notes confiscated . "
the bank concluded that an active media campaign and hidden security features in the new currency discouraged potential counterfeiters .
around 8.2 billion euro notes were in circulation last year .
the euro 's creators went out of their way to include a series of security marks on the new currency , which went into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 .
invisible watermarks , holograms and a silver foil running down one side of the bills were considered top line security measures against fraud .
to that the ecb added a massive media campaign that kept retailers and shoppers on the lookout for fake bills .
but as that campaign slackened , counterfeiters became bolder .
" there are many who waited because they feared with the very public introduction of the euro that too many people would be paying attention , " ute kadow , head of the anti-counterfeiting unit at the berlin state office of criminal investigation .
" but now , people pay as little attention to it as they did the d-mark .
the less people pay attention , the easier it will be for -lrb- the criminals -rrb- to work . "
eastern european gangs have big market by far the most popular bill among counterfeiters has been the € 50 note , which comprised almost 84 percent of all seizures , according to ecb figures .
investigators seized more than 8,000 of those bills in germany alone , making up the majority of the 13,698 counterfeit bills acquired by german police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police investigators believe the majority of counterfeit notes are being produced in the same former eastern bloc countries that were producing fake copies of europe 's national countries before the euro 's introduction .
in the around 800 cases investigated by police in eu countries , there have been 500 arrests , according to year-end statistics by the europe-wide police organization europol .
in september , police in bonn found a train locker full of counterfeit euro bills stored there by a hungarian man .
the € 8,500 euro was among the biggest in germany so far .
getting at the structure behind the suspects will be more difficult , said kadow .
the organizations behind the fraud are highly organized with the printing presses and know-how needed to pull off a good fake .
" the culprits do n't just sit around , " she said in a dw-world interview .
" they are very inventive and with the euro they have a bigger field .
you can use the euro almost anywhere . "
but most frauds remain the work of single counterfeiters , making crude copies on scanners of digital copy machines that are easily discovered through the " look-feel-tilt " method advocated by the ecb .
though the bank expects a slight increase in the amount of notes seized over the coming year , they are optimistic the black market wo n't be awash any time soon .
" it 's fairly probable that the amounts , based on the trends we have seen in the second half of the year , will increase , " said the ecb 's rodriguez .
" but it will be an increase in quantity , and a low increase in the quality . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cashing in on counterfeit euro bills police across europe think forgers will try to circulate fake euro bills in the upcoming weeks .

the influential early 80 ’ s german electro-punk duo deutsch-amerikanische freundschaft are back with a new album .
but they aren ’ t feeling quite as friendly this time around . in the early 1980 ’ s , deutsch-amerikanische freundschaft was the highly controversial electro-punk bank heading up the roster of the " new german wave " of politically-motivated rock bands . after a period of silence , daf- german-american friendship - is back with a new cd .
and although the band ’ s name remains the same , gabi delgado-lopez and robert gröl 's lyrics tell an increasingly anti-american tale . thumbing its nose at washington seems to be one of the duo ’ s favorite pastimes - one that can be heard often on the new cd , " 15 neue daf lieder " -lrb- 15 new daf songs -rrb- , which hits german store shelves on feb .
24 . the band still maintains its distinctive electro-punk edge on the album , which takes specific aim at american cultural imperialism and political dominance with wicked precision . " the sheriff - an anti-american song " the first single to be relased from the album , “ der sheriff - ein anti-amerikanishes lied ” -lrb- the sheriff – an anti-american song -rrb- is a direct reference to u.s president george w. bush and the war against terror he is spearheading .
the song , slated for release on feb .
10 , includes the chorus line : when the sheriff goes riding , everyone goes riding with him ; everyone must bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : respect what the sheriff says ; everyone must accept what the sheriff does . the sheriff is a godly man ; he knows the bible ; when he kills an egg thief ; everyone helps him out ; everyone must grasp who the sheriff is . “ our sheriff is bush , ” delgado-lopez told dw-world in a phone interview .
“ he 's an evil father figure who bashes all around him .
he is a figure of american cultural imperialism and political dominance - something that many , many people have had enough of . ” his partner in song , gröl , chimes in : " bush ’ s plans for a war against iraq are utterly shitty , to be frank .
the man has no interest in diplomacy , and if the war takes place , it will be an act of revenge more than anything else . " but daf 's mainstream record label , universal , is seeking a more soothing tone in its efforts to market the album .
" i would n't say the songs are particularly anti-american , " spokesman bob bierekoven told dw-world .
" they are more anti-bush and his policies and certainly are n't against the country or its people . " making german punk history görl , now 47 , and delgado-lopez , 45 , formed the band in 1978 after meeting at düsseldorf 's now legendary ratinger hof nightclub . they “ clicked immediately , ” according to gröl and decided then and there to form daf - a radical band for its time .
gröl would write the songs and play the synthesizer and drums while delgado-lopez , who is spanish , sang .
their name , they said , was ironic , referring to a period in post-war west german history when american influence was paramount . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de watching the buildings collapse online einstürzende neubauten , germany ’ s best known industrial rock band , has turned to the internet to control production and distribution of its newest work .

but banking authorities remain pleased with the low level of fraud during the currency 's ingaural year . after six months of down time , europe 's counterfeiters appear to be active once again , according to annual figures released this week by the european central bank .
in a short report documenting counterfeiting in the 12 countries that use the euro , the frankfurt-based bank reported that a total of 145,153 counterfeit notes were removed from circulation in the second half of 2002 .
the number marked a dramatic jump from the 21,965 notes seized in the first half of last year .
" it takes awhile , " ecb spokesman jean rodriguez said of the jump .
" during the first half we had an extremely low number of notes confiscated . "
the bank concluded that an active media campaign and hidden security features in the new currency discouraged potential counterfeiters .
around 8.2 billion euro notes were in circulation last year .
the euro 's creators went out of their way to include a series of security marks on the new currency , which went into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 .
invisible watermarks , holograms and a silver foil running down one side of the bills were considered top line security measures against fraud .
to that the ecb added a massive media campaign that kept retailers and shoppers on the lookout for fake bills .
but as that campaign slackened , counterfeiters became bolder .
" there are many who waited because they feared with the very public introduction of the euro that too many people would be paying attention , " ute kadow , head of the anti-counterfeiting unit at the berlin state office of criminal investigation .
" but now , people pay as little attention to it as they did the d-mark .
the less people pay attention , the easier it will be for -lrb- the criminals -rrb- to work . "
eastern european gangs have big market by far the most popular bill among counterfeiters has been the € 50 note , which comprised almost 84 percent of all seizures , according to ecb figures .
investigators seized more than 8,000 of those bills in germany alone , making up the majority of the 13,698 counterfeit bills acquired by german police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police investigators believe the majority of counterfeit notes are being produced in the same former eastern bloc countries that were producing fake copies of europe 's national countries before the euro 's introduction .
in the around 800 cases investigated by police in eu countries , there have been 500 arrests , according to year-end statistics by the europe-wide police organization europol .
in september , police in bonn found a train locker full of counterfeit euro bills stored there by a hungarian man .
the € 8,500 euro was among the biggest in germany so far .
getting at the structure behind the suspects will be more difficult , said kadow .
the organizations behind the fraud are highly organized with the printing presses and know-how needed to pull off a good fake .
" the culprits do n't just sit around , " she said in a dw-world interview .
" they are very inventive and with the euro they have a bigger field .
you can use the euro almost anywhere . "
but most frauds remain the work of single counterfeiters , making crude copies on scanners of digital copy machines that are easily discovered through the " look-feel-tilt " method advocated by the ecb .
though the bank expects a slight increase in the amount of notes seized over the coming year , they are optimistic the black market wo n't be awash any time soon .
" it 's fairly probable that the amounts , based on the trends we have seen in the second half of the year , will increase , " said the ecb 's rodriguez .
" but it will be an increase in quantity , and a low increase in the quality . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cashing in on counterfeit euro bills police across europe think forgers will try to circulate fake euro bills in the upcoming weeks .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .
" we want the inspectors to keep working , " fischer said on thursday . william pratt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , iraq and the united nations a dossier of dw-world 's full coverage of germany 's positions on iraq and the u.n. 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but banking authorities remain pleased with the low level of fraud during the currency 's ingaural year . after six months of down time , europe 's counterfeiters appear to be active once again , according to annual figures released this week by the european central bank .
in a short report documenting counterfeiting in the 12 countries that use the euro , the frankfurt-based bank reported that a total of 145,153 counterfeit notes were removed from circulation in the second half of 2002 .
the number marked a dramatic jump from the 21,965 notes seized in the first half of last year .
" it takes awhile , " ecb spokesman jean rodriguez said of the jump .
" during the first half we had an extremely low number of notes confiscated . "
the bank concluded that an active media campaign and hidden security features in the new currency discouraged potential counterfeiters .
around 8.2 billion euro notes were in circulation last year .
the euro 's creators went out of their way to include a series of security marks on the new currency , which went into circulation on jan .

and although the band ’ s name remains the same , gabi delgado-lopez and robert gröl 's lyrics tell an increasingly anti-american tale . thumbing its nose at washington seems to be one of the duo ’ s favorite pastimes - one that can be heard often on the new cd , " 15 neue daf lieder " -lrb- 15 new daf songs -rrb- , which hits german store shelves on feb .

“ he 's an evil father figure who bashes all around him .
he is a figure of american cultural imperialism and political dominance - something that many , many people have had enough of . ” his partner in song , gröl , chimes in : " bush ’ s plans for a war against iraq are utterly shitty , to be frank .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .

but banking authorities remain pleased with the low level of fraud during the currency 's ingaural year . after six months of down time , europe 's counterfeiters appear to be active once again , according to annual figures released this week by the european central bank .
in a short report documenting counterfeiting in the 12 countries that use the euro , the frankfurt-based bank reported that a total of 145,153 counterfeit notes were removed from circulation in the second half of 2002 .
the number marked a dramatic jump from the 21,965 notes seized in the first half of last year .
" it takes awhile , " ecb spokesman jean rodriguez said of the jump .
" during the first half we had an extremely low number of notes confiscated . "
the bank concluded that an active media campaign and hidden security features in the new currency discouraged potential counterfeiters .
around 8.2 billion euro notes were in circulation last year .
the euro 's creators went out of their way to include a series of security marks on the new currency , which went into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 .
invisible watermarks , holograms and a silver foil running down one side of the bills were considered top line security measures against fraud .
to that the ecb added a massive media campaign that kept retailers and shoppers on the lookout for fake bills .
but as that campaign slackened , counterfeiters became bolder .
" there are many who waited because they feared with the very public introduction of the euro that too many people would be paying attention , " ute kadow , head of the anti-counterfeiting unit at the berlin state office of criminal investigation .
" but now , people pay as little attention to it as they did the d-mark .
the less people pay attention , the easier it will be for -lrb- the criminals -rrb- to work . "
eastern european gangs have big market by far the most popular bill among counterfeiters has been the € 50 note , which comprised almost 84 percent of all seizures , according to ecb figures .
investigators seized more than 8,000 of those bills in germany alone , making up the majority of the 13,698 counterfeit bills acquired by german police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police investigators believe the majority of counterfeit notes are being produced in the same former eastern bloc countries that were producing fake copies of europe 's national countries before the euro 's introduction .
in the around 800 cases investigated by police in eu countries , there have been 500 arrests , according to year-end statistics by the europe-wide police organization europol .
in september , police in bonn found a train locker full of counterfeit euro bills stored there by a hungarian man .
the € 8,500 euro was among the biggest in germany so far .
getting at the structure behind the suspects will be more difficult , said kadow .
the organizations behind the fraud are highly organized with the printing presses and know-how needed to pull off a good fake .
" the culprits do n't just sit around , " she said in a dw-world interview .
" they are very inventive and with the euro they have a bigger field .
you can use the euro almost anywhere . "
but most frauds remain the work of single counterfeiters , making crude copies on scanners of digital copy machines that are easily discovered through the " look-feel-tilt " method advocated by the ecb .
though the bank expects a slight increase in the amount of notes seized over the coming year , they are optimistic the black market wo n't be awash any time soon .
" it 's fairly probable that the amounts , based on the trends we have seen in the second half of the year , will increase , " said the ecb 's rodriguez .

the influential early 80 ’ s german electro-punk duo deutsch-amerikanische freundschaft are back with a new album .
but they aren ’ t feeling quite as friendly this time around . in the early 1980 ’ s , deutsch-amerikanische freundschaft was the highly controversial electro-punk bank heading up the roster of the " new german wave " of politically-motivated rock bands . after a period of silence , daf- german-american friendship - is back with a new cd .
and although the band ’ s name remains the same , gabi delgado-lopez and robert gröl 's lyrics tell an increasingly anti-american tale . thumbing its nose at washington seems to be one of the duo ’ s favorite pastimes - one that can be heard often on the new cd , " 15 neue daf lieder " -lrb- 15 new daf songs -rrb- , which hits german store shelves on feb .
24 . the band still maintains its distinctive electro-punk edge on the album , which takes specific aim at american cultural imperialism and political dominance with wicked precision . " the sheriff - an anti-american song " the first single to be relased from the album , “ der sheriff - ein anti-amerikanishes lied ” -lrb- the sheriff – an anti-american song -rrb- is a direct reference to u.s president george w. bush and the war against terror he is spearheading .
the song , slated for release on feb .
10 , includes the chorus line : when the sheriff goes riding , everyone goes riding with him ; everyone must bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : respect what the sheriff says ; everyone must accept what the sheriff does . the sheriff is a godly man ; he knows the bible ; when he kills an egg thief ; everyone helps him out ; everyone must grasp who the sheriff is . “ our sheriff is bush , ” delgado-lopez told dw-world in a phone interview .
“ he 's an evil father figure who bashes all around him .
he is a figure of american cultural imperialism and political dominance - something that many , many people have had enough of . ” his partner in song , gröl , chimes in : " bush ’ s plans for a war against iraq are utterly shitty , to be frank .
the man has no interest in diplomacy , and if the war takes place , it will be an act of revenge more than anything else . " but daf 's mainstream record label , universal , is seeking a more soothing tone in its efforts to market the album .
" i would n't say the songs are particularly anti-american , " spokesman bob bierekoven told dw-world .
" they are more anti-bush and his policies and certainly are n't against the country or its people . " making german punk history görl , now 47 , and delgado-lopez , 45 , formed the band in 1978 after meeting at düsseldorf 's now legendary ratinger hof nightclub . they “ clicked immediately , ” according to gröl and decided then and there to form daf - a radical band for its time .
gröl would write the songs and play the synthesizer and drums while delgado-lopez , who is spanish , sang .
their name , they said , was ironic , referring to a period in post-war west german history when american influence was paramount . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de watching the buildings collapse online einstürzende neubauten , germany ’ s best known industrial rock band , has turned to the internet to control production and distribution of its newest work .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .
" we want the inspectors to keep working , " fischer said on thursday . william pratt send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany , iraq and the united nations a dossier of dw-world 's full coverage of germany 's positions on iraq and the u.n. 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .

the influential early 80 ’ s german electro-punk duo deutsch-amerikanische freundschaft are back with a new album .
but they aren ’ t feeling quite as friendly this time around . in the early 1980 ’ s , deutsch-amerikanische freundschaft was the highly controversial electro-punk bank heading up the roster of the " new german wave " of politically-motivated rock bands . after a period of silence , daf- german-american friendship - is back with a new cd .
and although the band ’ s name remains the same , gabi delgado-lopez and robert gröl 's lyrics tell an increasingly anti-american tale . thumbing its nose at washington seems to be one of the duo ’ s favorite pastimes - one that can be heard often on the new cd , " 15 neue daf lieder " -lrb- 15 new daf songs -rrb- , which hits german store shelves on feb .
24 . the band still maintains its distinctive electro-punk edge on the album , which takes specific aim at american cultural imperialism and political dominance with wicked precision . " the sheriff - an anti-american song " the first single to be relased from the album , “ der sheriff - ein anti-amerikanishes lied ” -lrb- the sheriff – an anti-american song -rrb- is a direct reference to u.s president george w. bush and the war against terror he is spearheading .
the song , slated for release on feb .

“ he 's an evil father figure who bashes all around him .
he is a figure of american cultural imperialism and political dominance - something that many , many people have had enough of . ” his partner in song , gröl , chimes in : " bush ’ s plans for a war against iraq are utterly shitty , to be frank .
the man has no interest in diplomacy , and if the war takes place , it will be an act of revenge more than anything else . " but daf 's mainstream record label , universal , is seeking a more soothing tone in its efforts to market the album .
" i would n't say the songs are particularly anti-american , " spokesman bob bierekoven told dw-world .
" they are more anti-bush and his policies and certainly are n't against the country or its people . " making german punk history görl , now 47 , and delgado-lopez , 45 , formed the band in 1978 after meeting at düsseldorf 's now legendary ratinger hof nightclub . they “ clicked immediately , ” according to gröl and decided then and there to form daf - a radical band for its time .
gröl would write the songs and play the synthesizer and drums while delgado-lopez , who is spanish , sang .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 24.01.2003 rainer schüttler tastes victory großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on a winning streak - rainer schüttler offers a rare display of emotion german tennis can once again dare to dream of taking home a grand slam title as rainer schüttler slams his way into the finals of the australian open with a sensational victory over american andy roddick . he was supposed to be the rising star on the german tennis horizon , filling in the shoes of the likes of boris becker and former davis cup captain michael stich .
and for a while in 1999 , it seemed that rainer schüttler was just the man for a floundering post-becker german tennis scene .
in january 1999 , schüttler exploded on to the tennis circuit with a stunning atp tournament victory in doha over british player tim henman , catapulting him to a world ranking of 66 .
the german media hailed him as the " new hope " and the spectacular win even moved a previously skeptical becker to remark that , " others have more talent than him .
but rainer manages to put in much more effort and perform better than other stylish players . "
spectacular comeback but as the tennis world waited with bated breath for schüttler to deliver after doha , the german disappointed with a series of uninspiring performances , barely making it beyond the first or second rounds in events including the davis cup premiere for germany in 1999 .
schüttler was more or less written off after those disasters .
but now 26-year-old schüttler has finally filled those expectations , which accompanied him at the start of his shooting-star career three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american andy roddick with a stunning 7:5 , 2:6 , 6:3 , 6:3 win over american andy roddick -lrb- photo -rrb- on friday , schüttler is now close to emulating german tennis legend boris becker 's last spectacular grand slam win of his career at the australian open seven years ago .
germany has not seen a grand slam victory since former wimbledon champion michael stich won the french open title seven years ago , just four months after becker 's coup at the australian open .
schüttler now becomes the sixth german to enter the finals of a grand slam tournament in tennis history .
" i 'm speechless , ecstatically happy !
it was a dream and i fulfilled it , " schüttler said after the marathon match that lasted two hours , 19 minutes - the longest in his career .
the game began on an unhappy note for schüttler , who appeared visibly nervous .
he lost his serve at the beginning , though recovered soon after to make the 20-year-old roddick - who had two marathon five-setters behind him - scramble after the ball .
schüttler also profited from a series of unforced errors from his opponent .
with a huge crowd of supporters rooting for him , schüttler clinched the first set after two break points .
but he seemed to be out of sorts in the second and lost the set in the face of errors and a weak serve .
from the third set on , schüttler regained his characteristic confidence and made roddick run for the ball and attacked his weak backhand .
the strategy paid off . roddick , who was suffering from a wrist injury , was fair enough not to excuse his defeat with his handicap .
" rainer played a clever game , absolutely brilliant !
he 's earned his spot in the finals , " roddick said later .
hard-hitting player schüttler , born in 1976 , first began playing tennis at 10 , hitting balls with his father , a postal worker , on a tennis court in his home city of korbach in the state of hessen .
for several years , tennis remained just a hobby for the blond schüttler .
" until the 11th grade , i never thought of becoming a professional player , " schüttler said in an interview with tennis guide in 1998 .
he was then discovered by coach dirk hordoff at a tournament in hessen and schüttler made rapid progress under his tutelage .
not exactly known as an elegant player , schüttler often relies heavily on his physical prowess to overpower his opponents .
he has been working with an athletics trainer for the past six years and with an iranian tae kwon do world champion for the past two .
schüttler is incredibly quick on his feet and almost deceptively simple in his persona on court - a baseball cap worn backwards is his trademark - but he also moves about with a huge dose of self-confidence .
asked whether it was a problem for him to be always standing in the shadows of german tennis heavyweights such as becker , stich , haas and kiefer , schüttler said " it 's normal .
the expectations in germany are always very high . "
coach hordoff said that schüttler had transformed his frame of mind on court .
" earlier , " he said , " rainer was under too much pressure to win , now he just goes out and has fun playing tennis . "
" he 's an absolutely solid guy , a proper german , " coach hordoff once told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper in an interview .
" he ’ s a cautious person who has no silly ideas in his head and no caprices , " hordoff said .
schüttler v. agassi up next bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. tennis player andre agassi schüttler will next face the match of his life as he meets three-time australian open winner and american star andre agassi -lrb- photo -rrb- in the finals on sunday .
schüttler - who has once before played agassi in 1998 at the atp tour in munich and lost a tame 1:6 , 4:6 to him - remains undaunted .
" i still have a dream .
sorry , andre , but you 've won here so many times , " schüttler said in front of a 1,500-strong crowd in the packed rod laver arena in melbourne as he was interviewed by tennis legend john mcenroe for australian television .
" he 's -lrb- agassi -rrb- one of the greatest tennis players ever .
maybe he 'll eat something wrong before the match ! , " schüttler joked when asked how he felt about playing agassi .
even if he loses to agassi on sunday , schüttler has already picked up a cool $ 593,925 for entering the finals .
and german tennis still stands to profit if schüttler fails to deliver in the finals - agassi plans to play mixed doubles with wife and german tennis phenomenon , steffi graf in the french open if he wins .
schüttler 's coach dirk hordorff offered better odds for his chances on sunday .
" agassi does n't come from a different world .
rainer simply has to play his game . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the australian open dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .

porsche says profit rose by 18 percent in the six months running to the end of january .
net income was up by 13.8 percent to about € 102 million -lrb- $ 110 million -rrb- , and sales increased by 20 percent .
but with the popularity of porsche 's former hot models waning , the stuttgart-based company is pinning its new hopes on the cayenne sports utility vehicle .
the german luxury sports car maker posted profits of some € 185 million during the first half of the current fiscal year .
the 18-percent jump from the same period a year earlier exceeded analysts ' expectations .
porsche forecasts sales will rise at least 5 percent in the second half , boosted by continued strong demand for its boxster and higher-margin 911 models .
but some analysts say both models are too old .
they believe added horsepower and new bumpers wo n't be enough to trigger such strong demand .
moreover , porsche depends on the united states for about half of its sales , but american consumption is stagnating . dw-world.de porsche opens factory in leipzig for new suv the exlusive sports carmaker ventured onto the mass market with the launch of a new luxury sports utility vehicle , and analysts see the new model bringing a big boost to sales .

24 . the band still maintains its distinctive electro-punk edge on the album , which takes specific aim at american cultural imperialism and political dominance with wicked precision .

but banking authorities remain pleased with the low level of fraud during the currency 's ingaural year . after six months of down time , europe 's counterfeiters appear to be active once again , according to annual figures released this week by the european central bank .
in a short report documenting counterfeiting in the 12 countries that use the euro , the frankfurt-based bank reported that a total of 145,153 counterfeit notes were removed from circulation in the second half of 2002 .
the number marked a dramatic jump from the 21,965 notes seized in the first half of last year .
" it takes awhile , " ecb spokesman jean rodriguez said of the jump .
" during the first half we had an extremely low number of notes confiscated . "
the bank concluded that an active media campaign and hidden security features in the new currency discouraged potential counterfeiters .
around 8.2 billion euro notes were in circulation last year .
the euro 's creators went out of their way to include a series of security marks on the new currency , which went into circulation on jan .

invisible watermarks , holograms and a silver foil running down one side of the bills were considered top line security measures against fraud .
to that the ecb added a massive media campaign that kept retailers and shoppers on the lookout for fake bills .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police investigators believe the majority of counterfeit notes are being produced in the same former eastern bloc countries that were producing fake copies of europe 's national countries before the euro 's introduction .
in the around 800 cases investigated by police in eu countries , there have been 500 arrests , according to year-end statistics by the europe-wide police organization europol .
in september , police in bonn found a train locker full of counterfeit euro bills stored there by a hungarian man .
the € 8,500 euro was among the biggest in germany so far .
getting at the structure behind the suspects will be more difficult , said kadow .
the organizations behind the fraud are highly organized with the printing presses and know-how needed to pull off a good fake .
" the culprits do n't just sit around , " she said in a dw-world interview .

you can use the euro almost anywhere . "
but most frauds remain the work of single counterfeiters , making crude copies on scanners of digital copy machines that are easily discovered through the " look-feel-tilt " method advocated by the ecb .
though the bank expects a slight increase in the amount of notes seized over the coming year , they are optimistic the black market wo n't be awash any time soon .

but banking authorities remain pleased with the low level of fraud during the currency 's ingaural year . after six months of down time , europe 's counterfeiters appear to be active once again , according to annual figures released this week by the european central bank .
in a short report documenting counterfeiting in the 12 countries that use the euro , the frankfurt-based bank reported that a total of 145,153 counterfeit notes were removed from circulation in the second half of 2002 .
the number marked a dramatic jump from the 21,965 notes seized in the first half of last year .
" it takes awhile , " ecb spokesman jean rodriguez said of the jump .
" during the first half we had an extremely low number of notes confiscated . "
the bank concluded that an active media campaign and hidden security features in the new currency discouraged potential counterfeiters .
around 8.2 billion euro notes were in circulation last year .
the euro 's creators went out of their way to include a series of security marks on the new currency , which went into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 .
invisible watermarks , holograms and a silver foil running down one side of the bills were considered top line security measures against fraud .
to that the ecb added a massive media campaign that kept retailers and shoppers on the lookout for fake bills .
but as that campaign slackened , counterfeiters became bolder .
" there are many who waited because they feared with the very public introduction of the euro that too many people would be paying attention , " ute kadow , head of the anti-counterfeiting unit at the berlin state office of criminal investigation .
" but now , people pay as little attention to it as they did the d-mark .
the less people pay attention , the easier it will be for -lrb- the criminals -rrb- to work . "
eastern european gangs have big market by far the most popular bill among counterfeiters has been the € 50 note , which comprised almost 84 percent of all seizures , according to ecb figures .
investigators seized more than 8,000 of those bills in germany alone , making up the majority of the 13,698 counterfeit bills acquired by german police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police investigators believe the majority of counterfeit notes are being produced in the same former eastern bloc countries that were producing fake copies of europe 's national countries before the euro 's introduction .
in the around 800 cases investigated by police in eu countries , there have been 500 arrests , according to year-end statistics by the europe-wide police organization europol .
in september , police in bonn found a train locker full of counterfeit euro bills stored there by a hungarian man .
the € 8,500 euro was among the biggest in germany so far .
getting at the structure behind the suspects will be more difficult , said kadow .
the organizations behind the fraud are highly organized with the printing presses and know-how needed to pull off a good fake .
" the culprits do n't just sit around , " she said in a dw-world interview .
" they are very inventive and with the euro they have a bigger field .
you can use the euro almost anywhere . "
but most frauds remain the work of single counterfeiters , making crude copies on scanners of digital copy machines that are easily discovered through the " look-feel-tilt " method advocated by the ecb .
though the bank expects a slight increase in the amount of notes seized over the coming year , they are optimistic the black market wo n't be awash any time soon .
" it 's fairly probable that the amounts , based on the trends we have seen in the second half of the year , will increase , " said the ecb 's rodriguez .

and for a while in 1999 , it seemed that rainer schüttler was just the man for a floundering post-becker german tennis scene .
in january 1999 , schüttler exploded on to the tennis circuit with a stunning atp tournament victory in doha over british player tim henman , catapulting him to a world ranking of 66 .
the german media hailed him as the " new hope " and the spectacular win even moved a previously skeptical becker to remark that , " others have more talent than him .
but rainer manages to put in much more effort and perform better than other stylish players . "
spectacular comeback but as the tennis world waited with bated breath for schüttler to deliver after doha , the german disappointed with a series of uninspiring performances , barely making it beyond the first or second rounds in events including the davis cup premiere for germany in 1999 .
schüttler was more or less written off after those disasters .
but now 26-year-old schüttler has finally filled those expectations , which accompanied him at the start of his shooting-star career three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american andy roddick with a stunning 7:5 , 2:6 , 6:3 , 6:3 win over american andy roddick -lrb- photo -rrb- on friday , schüttler is now close to emulating german tennis legend boris becker 's last spectacular grand slam win of his career at the australian open seven years ago .
germany has not seen a grand slam victory since former wimbledon champion michael stich won the french open title seven years ago , just four months after becker 's coup at the australian open .
schüttler now becomes the sixth german to enter the finals of a grand slam tournament in tennis history .
" i 'm speechless , ecstatically happy !
it was a dream and i fulfilled it , " schüttler said after the marathon match that lasted two hours , 19 minutes - the longest in his career .
the game began on an unhappy note for schüttler , who appeared visibly nervous .
he lost his serve at the beginning , though recovered soon after to make the 20-year-old roddick - who had two marathon five-setters behind him - scramble after the ball .
schüttler also profited from a series of unforced errors from his opponent .
with a huge crowd of supporters rooting for him , schüttler clinched the first set after two break points .
but he seemed to be out of sorts in the second and lost the set in the face of errors and a weak serve .
from the third set on , schüttler regained his characteristic confidence and made roddick run for the ball and attacked his weak backhand .
the strategy paid off . roddick , who was suffering from a wrist injury , was fair enough not to excuse his defeat with his handicap .
" rainer played a clever game , absolutely brilliant !
he 's earned his spot in the finals , " roddick said later .
hard-hitting player schüttler , born in 1976 , first began playing tennis at 10 , hitting balls with his father , a postal worker , on a tennis court in his home city of korbach in the state of hessen .
for several years , tennis remained just a hobby for the blond schüttler .
" until the 11th grade , i never thought of becoming a professional player , " schüttler said in an interview with tennis guide in 1998 .
he was then discovered by coach dirk hordoff at a tournament in hessen and schüttler made rapid progress under his tutelage .
not exactly known as an elegant player , schüttler often relies heavily on his physical prowess to overpower his opponents .
he has been working with an athletics trainer for the past six years and with an iranian tae kwon do world champion for the past two .
schüttler is incredibly quick on his feet and almost deceptively simple in his persona on court - a baseball cap worn backwards is his trademark - but he also moves about with a huge dose of self-confidence .
asked whether it was a problem for him to be always standing in the shadows of german tennis heavyweights such as becker , stich , haas and kiefer , schüttler said " it 's normal .
the expectations in germany are always very high . "
coach hordoff said that schüttler had transformed his frame of mind on court .
" earlier , " he said , " rainer was under too much pressure to win , now he just goes out and has fun playing tennis . "
" he 's an absolutely solid guy , a proper german , " coach hordoff once told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper in an interview .
" he ’ s a cautious person who has no silly ideas in his head and no caprices , " hordoff said .

schüttler - who has once before played agassi in 1998 at the atp tour in munich and lost a tame 1:6 , 4:6 to him - remains undaunted .
" i still have a dream .
sorry , andre , but you 've won here so many times , " schüttler said in front of a 1,500-strong crowd in the packed rod laver arena in melbourne as he was interviewed by tennis legend john mcenroe for australian television .
" he 's -lrb- agassi -rrb- one of the greatest tennis players ever .
maybe he 'll eat something wrong before the match ! , " schüttler joked when asked how he felt about playing agassi .
even if he loses to agassi on sunday , schüttler has already picked up a cool $ 593,925 for entering the finals .
and german tennis still stands to profit if schüttler fails to deliver in the finals - agassi plans to play mixed doubles with wife and german tennis phenomenon , steffi graf in the french open if he wins .

but banking authorities remain pleased with the low level of fraud during the currency 's ingaural year . after six months of down time , europe 's counterfeiters appear to be active once again , according to annual figures released this week by the european central bank .
in a short report documenting counterfeiting in the 12 countries that use the euro , the frankfurt-based bank reported that a total of 145,153 counterfeit notes were removed from circulation in the second half of 2002 .
the number marked a dramatic jump from the 21,965 notes seized in the first half of last year .
" it takes awhile , " ecb spokesman jean rodriguez said of the jump .
" during the first half we had an extremely low number of notes confiscated . "
the bank concluded that an active media campaign and hidden security features in the new currency discouraged potential counterfeiters .
around 8.2 billion euro notes were in circulation last year .
the euro 's creators went out of their way to include a series of security marks on the new currency , which went into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 .
invisible watermarks , holograms and a silver foil running down one side of the bills were considered top line security measures against fraud .
to that the ecb added a massive media campaign that kept retailers and shoppers on the lookout for fake bills .
but as that campaign slackened , counterfeiters became bolder .
" there are many who waited because they feared with the very public introduction of the euro that too many people would be paying attention , " ute kadow , head of the anti-counterfeiting unit at the berlin state office of criminal investigation .
" but now , people pay as little attention to it as they did the d-mark .
the less people pay attention , the easier it will be for -lrb- the criminals -rrb- to work . "
eastern european gangs have big market by far the most popular bill among counterfeiters has been the € 50 note , which comprised almost 84 percent of all seizures , according to ecb figures .
investigators seized more than 8,000 of those bills in germany alone , making up the majority of the 13,698 counterfeit bills acquired by german police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police investigators believe the majority of counterfeit notes are being produced in the same former eastern bloc countries that were producing fake copies of europe 's national countries before the euro 's introduction .
in the around 800 cases investigated by police in eu countries , there have been 500 arrests , according to year-end statistics by the europe-wide police organization europol .
in september , police in bonn found a train locker full of counterfeit euro bills stored there by a hungarian man .
the € 8,500 euro was among the biggest in germany so far .
getting at the structure behind the suspects will be more difficult , said kadow .
the organizations behind the fraud are highly organized with the printing presses and know-how needed to pull off a good fake .
" the culprits do n't just sit around , " she said in a dw-world interview .
" they are very inventive and with the euro they have a bigger field .
you can use the euro almost anywhere . "
but most frauds remain the work of single counterfeiters , making crude copies on scanners of digital copy machines that are easily discovered through the " look-feel-tilt " method advocated by the ecb .
though the bank expects a slight increase in the amount of notes seized over the coming year , they are optimistic the black market wo n't be awash any time soon .
" it 's fairly probable that the amounts , based on the trends we have seen in the second half of the year , will increase , " said the ecb 's rodriguez .
" but it will be an increase in quantity , and a low increase in the quality . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cashing in on counterfeit euro bills police across europe think forgers will try to circulate fake euro bills in the upcoming weeks .

the influential early 80 ’ s german electro-punk duo deutsch-amerikanische freundschaft are back with a new album .
but they aren ’ t feeling quite as friendly this time around . in the early 1980 ’ s , deutsch-amerikanische freundschaft was the highly controversial electro-punk bank heading up the roster of the " new german wave " of politically-motivated rock bands . after a period of silence , daf- german-american friendship - is back with a new cd .
and although the band ’ s name remains the same , gabi delgado-lopez and robert gröl 's lyrics tell an increasingly anti-american tale . thumbing its nose at washington seems to be one of the duo ’ s favorite pastimes - one that can be heard often on the new cd , " 15 neue daf lieder " -lrb- 15 new daf songs -rrb- , which hits german store shelves on feb .
24 . the band still maintains its distinctive electro-punk edge on the album , which takes specific aim at american cultural imperialism and political dominance with wicked precision . " the sheriff - an anti-american song " the first single to be relased from the album , “ der sheriff - ein anti-amerikanishes lied ” -lrb- the sheriff – an anti-american song -rrb- is a direct reference to u.s president george w. bush and the war against terror he is spearheading .
the song , slated for release on feb .
10 , includes the chorus line : when the sheriff goes riding , everyone goes riding with him ; everyone must bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : respect what the sheriff says ; everyone must accept what the sheriff does . the sheriff is a godly man ; he knows the bible ; when he kills an egg thief ; everyone helps him out ; everyone must grasp who the sheriff is . “ our sheriff is bush , ” delgado-lopez told dw-world in a phone interview .
“ he 's an evil father figure who bashes all around him .
he is a figure of american cultural imperialism and political dominance - something that many , many people have had enough of . ” his partner in song , gröl , chimes in : " bush ’ s plans for a war against iraq are utterly shitty , to be frank .
the man has no interest in diplomacy , and if the war takes place , it will be an act of revenge more than anything else . " but daf 's mainstream record label , universal , is seeking a more soothing tone in its efforts to market the album .
" i would n't say the songs are particularly anti-american , " spokesman bob bierekoven told dw-world .
" they are more anti-bush and his policies and certainly are n't against the country or its people . " making german punk history görl , now 47 , and delgado-lopez , 45 , formed the band in 1978 after meeting at düsseldorf 's now legendary ratinger hof nightclub . they “ clicked immediately , ” according to gröl and decided then and there to form daf - a radical band for its time .
gröl would write the songs and play the synthesizer and drums while delgado-lopez , who is spanish , sang .
their name , they said , was ironic , referring to a period in post-war west german history when american influence was paramount . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de watching the buildings collapse online einstürzende neubauten , germany ’ s best known industrial rock band , has turned to the internet to control production and distribution of its newest work .

the influential early 80 ’ s german electro-punk duo deutsch-amerikanische freundschaft are back with a new album .
but they aren ’ t feeling quite as friendly this time around . in the early 1980 ’ s , deutsch-amerikanische freundschaft was the highly controversial electro-punk bank heading up the roster of the " new german wave " of politically-motivated rock bands . after a period of silence , daf- german-american friendship - is back with a new cd .
and although the band ’ s name remains the same , gabi delgado-lopez and robert gröl 's lyrics tell an increasingly anti-american tale . thumbing its nose at washington seems to be one of the duo ’ s favorite pastimes - one that can be heard often on the new cd , " 15 neue daf lieder " -lrb- 15 new daf songs -rrb- , which hits german store shelves on feb .
24 . the band still maintains its distinctive electro-punk edge on the album , which takes specific aim at american cultural imperialism and political dominance with wicked precision . " the sheriff - an anti-american song " the first single to be relased from the album , “ der sheriff - ein anti-amerikanishes lied ” -lrb- the sheriff – an anti-american song -rrb- is a direct reference to u.s president george w. bush and the war against terror he is spearheading .
the song , slated for release on feb .
10 , includes the chorus line : when the sheriff goes riding , everyone goes riding with him ; everyone must bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : respect what the sheriff says ; everyone must accept what the sheriff does . the sheriff is a godly man ; he knows the bible ; when he kills an egg thief ; everyone helps him out ; everyone must grasp who the sheriff is . “ our sheriff is bush , ” delgado-lopez told dw-world in a phone interview .
“ he 's an evil father figure who bashes all around him .
he is a figure of american cultural imperialism and political dominance - something that many , many people have had enough of . ” his partner in song , gröl , chimes in : " bush ’ s plans for a war against iraq are utterly shitty , to be frank .
the man has no interest in diplomacy , and if the war takes place , it will be an act of revenge more than anything else . " but daf 's mainstream record label , universal , is seeking a more soothing tone in its efforts to market the album .
" i would n't say the songs are particularly anti-american , " spokesman bob bierekoven told dw-world .
" they are more anti-bush and his policies and certainly are n't against the country or its people . " making german punk history görl , now 47 , and delgado-lopez , 45 , formed the band in 1978 after meeting at düsseldorf 's now legendary ratinger hof nightclub . they “ clicked immediately , ” according to gröl and decided then and there to form daf - a radical band for its time .
gröl would write the songs and play the synthesizer and drums while delgado-lopez , who is spanish , sang .
their name , they said , was ironic , referring to a period in post-war west german history when american influence was paramount . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de watching the buildings collapse online einstürzende neubauten , germany ’ s best known industrial rock band , has turned to the internet to control production and distribution of its newest work .

and for a while in 1999 , it seemed that rainer schüttler was just the man for a floundering post-becker german tennis scene .
in january 1999 , schüttler exploded on to the tennis circuit with a stunning atp tournament victory in doha over british player tim henman , catapulting him to a world ranking of 66 .
the german media hailed him as the " new hope " and the spectacular win even moved a previously skeptical becker to remark that , " others have more talent than him .
but rainer manages to put in much more effort and perform better than other stylish players . "
spectacular comeback but as the tennis world waited with bated breath for schüttler to deliver after doha , the german disappointed with a series of uninspiring performances , barely making it beyond the first or second rounds in events including the davis cup premiere for germany in 1999 .
schüttler was more or less written off after those disasters .
but now 26-year-old schüttler has finally filled those expectations , which accompanied him at the start of his shooting-star career three years ago . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american andy roddick with a stunning 7:5 , 2:6 , 6:3 , 6:3 win over american andy roddick -lrb- photo -rrb- on friday , schüttler is now close to emulating german tennis legend boris becker 's last spectacular grand slam win of his career at the australian open seven years ago .
germany has not seen a grand slam victory since former wimbledon champion michael stich won the french open title seven years ago , just four months after becker 's coup at the australian open .
schüttler now becomes the sixth german to enter the finals of a grand slam tournament in tennis history .
" i 'm speechless , ecstatically happy !
it was a dream and i fulfilled it , " schüttler said after the marathon match that lasted two hours , 19 minutes - the longest in his career .
the game began on an unhappy note for schüttler , who appeared visibly nervous .
he lost his serve at the beginning , though recovered soon after to make the 20-year-old roddick - who had two marathon five-setters behind him - scramble after the ball .
schüttler also profited from a series of unforced errors from his opponent .
with a huge crowd of supporters rooting for him , schüttler clinched the first set after two break points .
but he seemed to be out of sorts in the second and lost the set in the face of errors and a weak serve .
from the third set on , schüttler regained his characteristic confidence and made roddick run for the ball and attacked his weak backhand .
the strategy paid off . roddick , who was suffering from a wrist injury , was fair enough not to excuse his defeat with his handicap .
" rainer played a clever game , absolutely brilliant !
he 's earned his spot in the finals , " roddick said later .
hard-hitting player schüttler , born in 1976 , first began playing tennis at 10 , hitting balls with his father , a postal worker , on a tennis court in his home city of korbach in the state of hessen .
for several years , tennis remained just a hobby for the blond schüttler .
" until the 11th grade , i never thought of becoming a professional player , " schüttler said in an interview with tennis guide in 1998 .
he was then discovered by coach dirk hordoff at a tournament in hessen and schüttler made rapid progress under his tutelage .
not exactly known as an elegant player , schüttler often relies heavily on his physical prowess to overpower his opponents .
he has been working with an athletics trainer for the past six years and with an iranian tae kwon do world champion for the past two .
schüttler is incredibly quick on his feet and almost deceptively simple in his persona on court - a baseball cap worn backwards is his trademark - but he also moves about with a huge dose of self-confidence .
asked whether it was a problem for him to be always standing in the shadows of german tennis heavyweights such as becker , stich , haas and kiefer , schüttler said " it 's normal .
the expectations in germany are always very high . "
coach hordoff said that schüttler had transformed his frame of mind on court .
" earlier , " he said , " rainer was under too much pressure to win , now he just goes out and has fun playing tennis . "
" he 's an absolutely solid guy , a proper german , " coach hordoff once told the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper in an interview .
" he ’ s a cautious person who has no silly ideas in his head and no caprices , " hordoff said .
schüttler v. agassi up next bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. tennis player andre agassi schüttler will next face the match of his life as he meets three-time australian open winner and american star andre agassi -lrb- photo -rrb- in the finals on sunday .
schüttler - who has once before played agassi in 1998 at the atp tour in munich and lost a tame 1:6 , 4:6 to him - remains undaunted .
" i still have a dream .
sorry , andre , but you 've won here so many times , " schüttler said in front of a 1,500-strong crowd in the packed rod laver arena in melbourne as he was interviewed by tennis legend john mcenroe for australian television .
" he 's -lrb- agassi -rrb- one of the greatest tennis players ever .
maybe he 'll eat something wrong before the match ! , " schüttler joked when asked how he felt about playing agassi .
even if he loses to agassi on sunday , schüttler has already picked up a cool $ 593,925 for entering the finals .
and german tennis still stands to profit if schüttler fails to deliver in the finals - agassi plans to play mixed doubles with wife and german tennis phenomenon , steffi graf in the french open if he wins .
schüttler 's coach dirk hordorff offered better odds for his chances on sunday .
" agassi does n't come from a different world .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.01.2003 euro counterfeiters open for business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the 50 euro bills in this photo are real the euro is becoming an attractive target for counterfeiters as public vigilance begins to slip .
but banking authorities remain pleased with the low level of fraud during the currency 's ingaural year . after six months of down time , europe 's counterfeiters appear to be active once again , according to annual figures released this week by the european central bank .
in a short report documenting counterfeiting in the 12 countries that use the euro , the frankfurt-based bank reported that a total of 145,153 counterfeit notes were removed from circulation in the second half of 2002 .
the number marked a dramatic jump from the 21,965 notes seized in the first half of last year .
" it takes awhile , " ecb spokesman jean rodriguez said of the jump .
" during the first half we had an extremely low number of notes confiscated . "
the bank concluded that an active media campaign and hidden security features in the new currency discouraged potential counterfeiters .
around 8.2 billion euro notes were in circulation last year .
the euro 's creators went out of their way to include a series of security marks on the new currency , which went into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 .
invisible watermarks , holograms and a silver foil running down one side of the bills were considered top line security measures against fraud .
to that the ecb added a massive media campaign that kept retailers and shoppers on the lookout for fake bills .
but as that campaign slackened , counterfeiters became bolder .
" there are many who waited because they feared with the very public introduction of the euro that too many people would be paying attention , " ute kadow , head of the anti-counterfeiting unit at the berlin state office of criminal investigation .
" but now , people pay as little attention to it as they did the d-mark .
the less people pay attention , the easier it will be for -lrb- the criminals -rrb- to work . "
eastern european gangs have big market by far the most popular bill among counterfeiters has been the € 50 note , which comprised almost 84 percent of all seizures , according to ecb figures .
investigators seized more than 8,000 of those bills in germany alone , making up the majority of the 13,698 counterfeit bills acquired by german police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police investigators believe the majority of counterfeit notes are being produced in the same former eastern bloc countries that were producing fake copies of europe 's national countries before the euro 's introduction .
in the around 800 cases investigated by police in eu countries , there have been 500 arrests , according to year-end statistics by the europe-wide police organization europol .
in september , police in bonn found a train locker full of counterfeit euro bills stored there by a hungarian man .
the € 8,500 euro was among the biggest in germany so far .
getting at the structure behind the suspects will be more difficult , said kadow .
the organizations behind the fraud are highly organized with the printing presses and know-how needed to pull off a good fake .
" the culprits do n't just sit around , " she said in a dw-world interview .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .

while germany thinks about the need for more reports from arms inspectors in iraq , germans and french assail the u.s. defense secretary 's criticism of " old europe . " politicians in berlin and paris expressed their disapproval on thursday at the latest salvos volleyed by u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld over germany and france 's reluctance to move forward with plans for a u.s.-led war against iraq .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld criticized german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac on wednesday for their public demands that united nations weapons inspectors be given more time to do their jobs before any military action could be taken .
as a permanent member of the security council , france could veto any resolution , raising the possibility that u.s. president george w. bush would be forced to wage war without the support of the international body .
rumsfeld dismissed critical comments made by schröder and chirac , responding to reporters queries by saying : " you 're thinking of germany and france .
i do n't .
i think that 's the old europe . "
" problematic " comments that are " deeply insulting " rumsfeld 's shoot-from-the-hip comments drew swift criticism across germany and france on thursday - and even came from some unlikely quarters , including senior members of germany 's main opposition party , historically a close ally of washington .
angela merkel , chairwoman of the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- described rumsfeld 's comments as " problematic , " adding : " i do n't think it is right to make such noises - calling us the ' old europe . " '
her colleague volker rühe , who heads the german parliament 's foreign affairs committee , went a step further , saying " rumsfeld is no diplomat . "
european parliament member bernd posselt , a member of the cdu 's sister party , the christian social union , admonished rumsfeld for his " neocolonialist " statements and called on him to think of europe as a " partner " rather than a " protectorate . "
the feathers seemed even more ruffled in france , where economics minister francis mer said he was " deeply insulted " by the defense secretary 's comments .
" he hit the nail on the head " but some political observers approved of , even greeted the comments .
bernhard may of the german council of foreign relations said he thought rumsfeld was taking a negative approach to achieve a positive result : to show the europeans that they are needed in the confrontation with iraq .
" only when we work together can we achieve something , " may told dw-world .
" if we do n't work together , then the alliance becomes weakened and the pressure on saddam lessens . "
meanwhile , from his office in the former german capital of bonn , professor christian hacke told dw-world he agreed with rumsfeld 's comments .
" he really hit the nail on the head , " hacke said .
the problem , he said , is that germany is pursuing a " catastrophic " policy in its dealings with the united states .
" we have turned the united states into an opponent of our own diplomacy , " he said germany to demand second report from inspectors officials in germany 's government sought to play down the spat .
" mr. rumsfeld described the europeans as being old , " foreign minister joschka fischer said on thursday .
" and , in fact , the cultures and countries are older than the usa . "
but the rhetorical skirmish with rumsfeld comes at a difficult time for schröder 's government , which has said it will ask the u.n. security council to require its weapons inspectors to issue another report on their work after they turn in their much-anticipated first review next monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 24.01.2003 euro counterfeiters open for business großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : none of the 50 euro bills in this photo are real the euro is becoming an attractive target for counterfeiters as public vigilance begins to slip .
but banking authorities remain pleased with the low level of fraud during the currency 's ingaural year . after six months of down time , europe 's counterfeiters appear to be active once again , according to annual figures released this week by the european central bank .
in a short report documenting counterfeiting in the 12 countries that use the euro , the frankfurt-based bank reported that a total of 145,153 counterfeit notes were removed from circulation in the second half of 2002 .
the number marked a dramatic jump from the 21,965 notes seized in the first half of last year .
" it takes awhile , " ecb spokesman jean rodriguez said of the jump .
" during the first half we had an extremely low number of notes confiscated . "
the bank concluded that an active media campaign and hidden security features in the new currency discouraged potential counterfeiters .
around 8.2 billion euro notes were in circulation last year .
the euro 's creators went out of their way to include a series of security marks on the new currency , which went into circulation on jan .
1 , 2002 .
invisible watermarks , holograms and a silver foil running down one side of the bills were considered top line security measures against fraud .
to that the ecb added a massive media campaign that kept retailers and shoppers on the lookout for fake bills .
but as that campaign slackened , counterfeiters became bolder .
" there are many who waited because they feared with the very public introduction of the euro that too many people would be paying attention , " ute kadow , head of the anti-counterfeiting unit at the berlin state office of criminal investigation .
" but now , people pay as little attention to it as they did the d-mark .
the less people pay attention , the easier it will be for -lrb- the criminals -rrb- to work . "
eastern european gangs have big market by far the most popular bill among counterfeiters has been the € 50 note , which comprised almost 84 percent of all seizures , according to ecb figures .
investigators seized more than 8,000 of those bills in germany alone , making up the majority of the 13,698 counterfeit bills acquired by german police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german police investigators believe the majority of counterfeit notes are being produced in the same former eastern bloc countries that were producing fake copies of europe 's national countries before the euro 's introduction .
in the around 800 cases investigated by police in eu countries , there have been 500 arrests , according to year-end statistics by the europe-wide police organization europol .
in september , police in bonn found a train locker full of counterfeit euro bills stored there by a hungarian man .
the € 8,500 euro was among the biggest in germany so far .
getting at the structure behind the suspects will be more difficult , said kadow .
the organizations behind the fraud are highly organized with the printing presses and know-how needed to pull off a good fake .
" the culprits do n't just sit around , " she said in a dw-world interview .
" they are very inventive and with the euro they have a bigger field .
you can use the euro almost anywhere . "
but most frauds remain the work of single counterfeiters , making crude copies on scanners of digital copy machines that are easily discovered through the " look-feel-tilt " method advocated by the ecb .
though the bank expects a slight increase in the amount of notes seized over the coming year , they are optimistic the black market wo n't be awash any time soon .
" it 's fairly probable that the amounts , based on the trends we have seen in the second half of the year , will increase , " said the ecb 's rodriguez .
" but it will be an increase in quantity , and a low increase in the quality . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de cashing in on counterfeit euro bills police across europe think forgers will try to circulate fake euro bills in the upcoming weeks .

denbighshire council is expected to announce on friday it has appointed a contractor to carry out the work in ruthin and that it has set a date to start .
the £ 1m defence scheme has hit delays , angering local residents and politicians .
work was held up after a dispute with landowners .
the culvert is prone to flooding ruthin residents had been promised defences to prevent further damage to their homes after the area flooded four times in four years .
but the environment agency has said that many residents living in the worst-hit area of the town have not signed up to a 24-hour flood warning telephone messaging service .
the agency has said it is surprised that just 165 properties out of 400 in the worst-hit part of town have signed up for the scheme .
it is appealing for the remaining residents to register for the scheme .
speaking about the delays , before christmas , clwyd west am alun pugh said : " the project is desperately needed to remove the very real fear of flooding from the town . "
severe flooding in the past severe flooding has affected residential and commercial properties around the mwrog street and borthyn areas of the town .
since 1998 , there have been a number of separate flooding incidents resulting from problems with a culvert , which runs from mwrog street to the river clwyd .
under the new project a brook which runs under the street and along farmland to denbigh road will be re-directed to join the river clwyd .
the water will then be carried away from the town .
councillors carried out a consultation last year over the plans and more than 90 % of the public were in favour of the initiative .

the german firm made a second-half pre-tax profit of 185m euros -lrb- £ 123m ; $ 199m -rrb- , up by 18 % year on year .
at the same time , sales were up almost 20 % , reflecting a rash of new product launches from porsche in the past year .

big ambitions porsche is in the process of shifting its once-tight focus on pure sports cars .
last year , it launched its first four-wheel-drive vehicle , the cayenne , and expressed the hope that it would become its main earner in years to come .
in the meantime , its much older 911 and boxster sports cars are selling weakly .
the latest figures indicate that porsche is having some success at shifting customers to more high-priced vehicles .
