planetside is set on the alien planet auraxis planetside is ambitious , the environment is epic and - aside from some lag issues , a cruel learning curve and wasted time getting from a to b - the gameplay can be intense .
at a glance , planetside has elements of games like halo , with first-person shooting , armoured soldiers , drop-ships and jeeps .
but it is actually a significantly innovative blend of the first-person shooter -lrb- fps -rrb- with a massively multiplayer online game , like everquest .
it is an " mmofps " , building on the foundations of other online shooters where the number of players has been limited .
digital strangers the planetside battleground is set on the alien planet auraxis , where three factions fight it out for control of bases on 10 continents .
there are already 50,000 subscribers in the us and 20,000 in europe .
i am self-conscious about my shoddy game-skill levels for starters discuss this story on bbci collective it is filled with the avatars of thousands of people , two thirds of whom will be gunning for you and your compatriots .
now , for someone who is never especially got into the massively multi-player online gaming thing or multiplayer shooters , a video game that combines sci-fi first-person shooting action with something of the strategising of the board game risk is a compelling prospect .
aside from the above-mentioned issues , planetside is remarkable and , when the action kicks off , it is frenetic and exciting .
however , you can not get on here if you are shy as this is a teamplay game .
but i am perturbed by the challenge of bonding with digital strangers .
i am self-conscious about my shoddy game-skill levels for starters .
odd , possibly , considering i am hiding behind a pseudonymous avatar .
personally , i have always been more inclined towards one-player , narrative-based adventures .
planetside , however , is pointless as a solo experience .
there are no one-player missions and there is no narrative , just the ebb and flow of terrain being conquered then lost , then taken again .
sony 's landmark game is a constantly evolving proposition , however .
patches and tweaks are constantly being added , and the first expansion pack is already due out in october .
i doubt planetside will ever be suited to us go-it-alone types , though , so i will really have to work on my massively multi-player online shyness .

planetside is set on the alien planet auraxis planetside is ambitious , the environment is epic and - aside from some lag issues , a cruel learning curve and wasted time getting from a to b - the gameplay can be intense .
at a glance , planetside has elements of games like halo , with first-person shooting , armoured soldiers , drop-ships and jeeps .
but it is actually a significantly innovative blend of the first-person shooter -lrb- fps -rrb- with a massively multiplayer online game , like everquest .
it is an " mmofps " , building on the foundations of other online shooters where the number of players has been limited .
digital strangers the planetside battleground is set on the alien planet auraxis , where three factions fight it out for control of bases on 10 continents .
there are already 50,000 subscribers in the us and 20,000 in europe .
i am self-conscious about my shoddy game-skill levels for starters discuss this story on bbci collective it is filled with the avatars of thousands of people , two thirds of whom will be gunning for you and your compatriots .
now , for someone who is never especially got into the massively multi-player online gaming thing or multiplayer shooters , a video game that combines sci-fi first-person shooting action with something of the strategising of the board game risk is a compelling prospect .
aside from the above-mentioned issues , planetside is remarkable and , when the action kicks off , it is frenetic and exciting .
however , you can not get on here if you are shy as this is a teamplay game .
but i am perturbed by the challenge of bonding with digital strangers .
i am self-conscious about my shoddy game-skill levels for starters .
odd , possibly , considering i am hiding behind a pseudonymous avatar .
personally , i have always been more inclined towards one-player , narrative-based adventures .
planetside , however , is pointless as a solo experience .
there are no one-player missions and there is no narrative , just the ebb and flow of terrain being conquered then lost , then taken again .
sony 's landmark game is a constantly evolving proposition , however .
patches and tweaks are constantly being added , and the first expansion pack is already due out in october .
i doubt planetside will ever be suited to us go-it-alone types , though , so i will really have to work on my massively multi-player online shyness .

advances in ultrasound scanning have allowed doctors to see that babies in the womb exhibit facial expressions as a reflex in preparation for birth , obstetrician stuart campbell said .
it was previously thought babies learned to smile after birth by copying their mothers .
since 2001 professor campbell has captured images of babies smiling , using a revolutionary 4d scanner .
" they make breathing movements inside the uterus , but there is no air , and they blink , but there is no light , so it seems they are making preparations for birth , " he said .
babies do not normally smile after birth until they are about six weeks old .
i do n't think people realise the range of facial expressions you get inside the uterus , or indeed that babies blink professor stuart campbell obstetrician " this may indicate the baby 's calm , trouble-free existence in the womb and the relatively traumatic first few weeks after birth , when the baby is reacting to a strange , new environment , " prof campbell said .
" i do n't think people realise the range of facial expressions you get inside the uterus , or indeed that babies blink .
" with 2d scanning you can see the eyeballs rolling , but now with 4d scanning it is quite clear that they are opening their eyelids , and that is in a very dark environment , so it must be a reflex .
reflex smiling , however , can not be interpreted as preparation for birth but may be a reflex , prof campbell said .
he said : " what 's behind the smile , of course , i ca n't say , but the corners turn up and the cheeks bulge ...
i think it must be some indication of contentment in a stress-free environment . "
the 4d scanner , which produces detailed 3d images that move in real time , has shown that babies start making finger movements at 15 weeks , yawning at 18 weeks and smiling , blinking and crying at 26 weeks .
a one-hour consultation with 4d ultrasound scanning at the create health clinic where prof campbell pioneered its use , costs Â£ 275 .
the images show the delightful reality of the humanity of the unborn baby julia millington pro-life party the pro-life party reacted immediately to the images by claiming it strengthened their arguments against abortion .
pro-life spokeswoman julia millington said : " the images show the delightful reality of the humanity of the unborn baby .
" we can not believe that anybody could continue supporting abortion when they see these extraordinary pictures . "
