program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2003 eu warns germany over budget deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel has an expensive headache .
germany says its budget deficit will exceed the legal limits stipulated by the pact regulating the euro for the second year .
the news has brussels shaking its finger and the opposition calling for heads to roll . despite plans to reform its labor market and social system , germany will fail to meet the criteria of the european union pact ensuring the stability of its common currency , the euro , in 2003 .
nor will it be able to achieve a balanced budget as previously planned by 2006 .
" we ca n't make it by 2006 any more unless there is an economic miracle , " finance minister hans eichel told the newsweekly der spiegel over the weekend .
but in a country with unemployment at nearly 4.5 million and growing , an economic miracle is highly unlikely .
the news comes as a political blow to eichel , who has made shrinking deficit spending and balancing the federal budget his key policy goal .
until recently , eichel had forecast a cut in deficit spending to 2.7 percent this year .
opposition politicians immediately demanded eichel 's resignation .
" i 'm not one to make regular resignation demands , " said friedrich merz , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union .
" but what has happened in the past days , surely that is enough reason to say that the finance minister has failed across the board and personally , too . "
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has come out in support of his finance minister , telling public broadcaster zdf on monday that " there is no discussion about eichel " and that he could keep his ministry post through the end of his term in 2006 .
a fiscal flu germany is not alone in straying from the stability pact 's stringent criteria - and eu leaders fear the fiscal flu could spread to other euro zone countries .
france has also had its name added to the eu 's fiscal " black book . "
france has repeatedly stated it will not meet the rules of the pact , which stipulates that government deficit spending may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
with both germany and france failing to meet the requirements , european union officials fear other countries will have less motivation to follow the pact and that , ultimately , the euro could be weakened .
" -lrb- european economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro -rrb- solbes is afraid that if germany fails to meet the three percent limit three consecutive times that the french and italians wo n't see any reason to continue to adhere to the stability pact , " an unnamed german government source told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes in a telephone conversation with eichel over the weekend , solbes warned germany that it must adhere to the provisions of the stability and growth pact by 2004 .
" next year , the nominal deficit must fall below the 3 percent limit , " a spokesman for solbes told the newspaper .
but solbes ' warning may find little resonance in berlin .
chancellor schröder himself has questioned the logic of the 3-percent ceiling on deficit spending .
during the devastating floods last summer in eastern germany and again during his reelection campaign , schröder criticized the stringent parameters laid out in the pact .
with staggering unemployment of nearly 4.5 million - the highest level since german reunification - and uncertainty about the extent to which reforms of germany 's social system and labor market - it is unlikely germany will be able to meet its own goals for balancing the budget .
" a balanced 2006 budget would require growth rates that i can not expect and if achieving this meant cutting spending as much as revenues are falling , or giving up the 2005 tax reform , i would not be ready for it , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told zdf . a fierce political debate schröder is currently seeking to push through a package of reforms that will reduce unemployment and retirement benefits that are pushing berlin 's deficit spending through the roof .
the plan also calls for a loosening of the country 's labor laws to make hiring and firing easier . but schröder is facing considerable resistance from deeply entrenched unions as well as the left wing of his own party , the social democrats .
the somnambulistic pace of negotiations surrounding the reform package has forced the government to undertake other measures to fill the budget gap . last week , the government announced it would increase its tax on cigarettes by € 1 per pack .
despite that effort , berlin is still anticipating a budget shortfall in excess of the previously planned 18.9 billion .
still , the cigarette tax is only expected to bring in € 4 billion for the country 's public healthcare fund , which is itself anticipating a € 4.5 billion shortfall .
opposition politicians have warned the government against any increases to the federal sales tax , which is currently 16 percent .
for his part , eichel says the government is still planning to better balance its budget .
" we have n't failed in consolidating -lrb- the budget -rrb- , it 's just going to take longer , " eichel said his interview with der spiegel .
the eu has already issued an " excessive deficit procedure " against germany and the country faces massive fines if it is unable to balance its budget by 2006 .
it remains possible that the german government may be forced to introduce future tax increases in its bid to balance the books and escape eu action . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions propose alternative to government reforms germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .

germany says its budget deficit will exceed the legal limits stipulated by the pact regulating the euro for the second year .
the news has brussels shaking its finger and the opposition calling for heads to roll . despite plans to reform its labor market and social system , germany will fail to meet the criteria of the european union pact ensuring the stability of its common currency , the euro , in 2003 .
nor will it be able to achieve a balanced budget as previously planned by 2006 .
" we ca n't make it by 2006 any more unless there is an economic miracle , " finance minister hans eichel told the newsweekly der spiegel over the weekend .
but in a country with unemployment at nearly 4.5 million and growing , an economic miracle is highly unlikely .
the news comes as a political blow to eichel , who has made shrinking deficit spending and balancing the federal budget his key policy goal .
until recently , eichel had forecast a cut in deficit spending to 2.7 percent this year .
opposition politicians immediately demanded eichel 's resignation .
" i 'm not one to make regular resignation demands , " said friedrich merz , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union .
" but what has happened in the past days , surely that is enough reason to say that the finance minister has failed across the board and personally , too . "

on monday , the government officially launched a program that will introduce all-day schools across the country for the first time . german education minister edelgard bulmahn signed an agreement between the federal government and the german states that will lead to the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools nationwide . an investment in learning as part of its € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- investment program in the federal education system , the german government said it would set up a new independent agency to develop and evaluate educational standards nationwide as well as an expert commission to oversee education across the country . around € 300 million will be made available this year for individual german states to set up the all-day schools for children aged 6-16 .
a further € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- will be paid out over the next three years , with € 700 million -lrb- $ 810 million -rrb- to be invested in 2007 . " we need a new culture of optimism for education , " bulmahn said in a statement , adding that all day schooling would offer more time for learning and provide " more variety in education . " currently , the majority of schools in germany operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . improving education in a study released by the organization for economic cooperation and development last year know as the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , germany scored well below average , joining italy , hungary and poland in the bottom third . the study also revealed that german school children had poor reading skills and less knowledge of mathematics than students in other countries . many teachers in germany are in favor of the educational reforms .
a survey commissioned by the germany 's teacher 's union last year revealed that more than half would welcome a longer school day . parents are also expected to benefit from being able to send their children to school for the entire day .
many argue that half-day schooling prevents parents from being able to return to work . germany 's education ministry is counting on widespread support to help facilitate implementation of the ambitious plan .

germany says its budget deficit will exceed the legal limits stipulated by the pact regulating the euro for the second year .
the news has brussels shaking its finger and the opposition calling for heads to roll . despite plans to reform its labor market and social system , germany will fail to meet the criteria of the european union pact ensuring the stability of its common currency , the euro , in 2003 .
nor will it be able to achieve a balanced budget as previously planned by 2006 .
" we ca n't make it by 2006 any more unless there is an economic miracle , " finance minister hans eichel told the newsweekly der spiegel over the weekend .
but in a country with unemployment at nearly 4.5 million and growing , an economic miracle is highly unlikely .
the news comes as a political blow to eichel , who has made shrinking deficit spending and balancing the federal budget his key policy goal .
until recently , eichel had forecast a cut in deficit spending to 2.7 percent this year .
opposition politicians immediately demanded eichel 's resignation .
" i 'm not one to make regular resignation demands , " said friedrich merz , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union .
" but what has happened in the past days , surely that is enough reason to say that the finance minister has failed across the board and personally , too . "
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has come out in support of his finance minister , telling public broadcaster zdf on monday that " there is no discussion about eichel " and that he could keep his ministry post through the end of his term in 2006 .
a fiscal flu germany is not alone in straying from the stability pact 's stringent criteria - and eu leaders fear the fiscal flu could spread to other euro zone countries .
france has also had its name added to the eu 's fiscal " black book . "
france has repeatedly stated it will not meet the rules of the pact , which stipulates that government deficit spending may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
with both germany and france failing to meet the requirements , european union officials fear other countries will have less motivation to follow the pact and that , ultimately , the euro could be weakened .
" -lrb- european economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro -rrb- solbes is afraid that if germany fails to meet the three percent limit three consecutive times that the french and italians wo n't see any reason to continue to adhere to the stability pact , " an unnamed german government source told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes in a telephone conversation with eichel over the weekend , solbes warned germany that it must adhere to the provisions of the stability and growth pact by 2004 .
" next year , the nominal deficit must fall below the 3 percent limit , " a spokesman for solbes told the newspaper .
but solbes ' warning may find little resonance in berlin .
chancellor schröder himself has questioned the logic of the 3-percent ceiling on deficit spending .
during the devastating floods last summer in eastern germany and again during his reelection campaign , schröder criticized the stringent parameters laid out in the pact .
with staggering unemployment of nearly 4.5 million - the highest level since german reunification - and uncertainty about the extent to which reforms of germany 's social system and labor market - it is unlikely germany will be able to meet its own goals for balancing the budget .
" a balanced 2006 budget would require growth rates that i can not expect and if achieving this meant cutting spending as much as revenues are falling , or giving up the 2005 tax reform , i would not be ready for it , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told zdf . a fierce political debate schröder is currently seeking to push through a package of reforms that will reduce unemployment and retirement benefits that are pushing berlin 's deficit spending through the roof .
the plan also calls for a loosening of the country 's labor laws to make hiring and firing easier . but schröder is facing considerable resistance from deeply entrenched unions as well as the left wing of his own party , the social democrats .
the somnambulistic pace of negotiations surrounding the reform package has forced the government to undertake other measures to fill the budget gap . last week , the government announced it would increase its tax on cigarettes by € 1 per pack .
despite that effort , berlin is still anticipating a budget shortfall in excess of the previously planned 18.9 billion .
still , the cigarette tax is only expected to bring in € 4 billion for the country 's public healthcare fund , which is itself anticipating a € 4.5 billion shortfall .
opposition politicians have warned the government against any increases to the federal sales tax , which is currently 16 percent .
for his part , eichel says the government is still planning to better balance its budget .
" we have n't failed in consolidating -lrb- the budget -rrb- , it 's just going to take longer , " eichel said his interview with der spiegel .
the eu has already issued an " excessive deficit procedure " against germany and the country faces massive fines if it is unable to balance its budget by 2006 .
it remains possible that the german government may be forced to introduce future tax increases in its bid to balance the books and escape eu action . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions propose alternative to government reforms germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .

germany says its budget deficit will exceed the legal limits stipulated by the pact regulating the euro for the second year .
the news has brussels shaking its finger and the opposition calling for heads to roll . despite plans to reform its labor market and social system , germany will fail to meet the criteria of the european union pact ensuring the stability of its common currency , the euro , in 2003 .
nor will it be able to achieve a balanced budget as previously planned by 2006 .
" we ca n't make it by 2006 any more unless there is an economic miracle , " finance minister hans eichel told the newsweekly der spiegel over the weekend .
but in a country with unemployment at nearly 4.5 million and growing , an economic miracle is highly unlikely .
the news comes as a political blow to eichel , who has made shrinking deficit spending and balancing the federal budget his key policy goal .
until recently , eichel had forecast a cut in deficit spending to 2.7 percent this year .
opposition politicians immediately demanded eichel 's resignation .
" i 'm not one to make regular resignation demands , " said friedrich merz , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union .
" but what has happened in the past days , surely that is enough reason to say that the finance minister has failed across the board and personally , too . "
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has come out in support of his finance minister , telling public broadcaster zdf on monday that " there is no discussion about eichel " and that he could keep his ministry post through the end of his term in 2006 .
a fiscal flu germany is not alone in straying from the stability pact 's stringent criteria - and eu leaders fear the fiscal flu could spread to other euro zone countries .
france has also had its name added to the eu 's fiscal " black book . "
france has repeatedly stated it will not meet the rules of the pact , which stipulates that government deficit spending may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
with both germany and france failing to meet the requirements , european union officials fear other countries will have less motivation to follow the pact and that , ultimately , the euro could be weakened .
" -lrb- european economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro -rrb- solbes is afraid that if germany fails to meet the three percent limit three consecutive times that the french and italians wo n't see any reason to continue to adhere to the stability pact , " an unnamed german government source told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes in a telephone conversation with eichel over the weekend , solbes warned germany that it must adhere to the provisions of the stability and growth pact by 2004 .
" next year , the nominal deficit must fall below the 3 percent limit , " a spokesman for solbes told the newspaper .
but solbes ' warning may find little resonance in berlin .
chancellor schröder himself has questioned the logic of the 3-percent ceiling on deficit spending .
during the devastating floods last summer in eastern germany and again during his reelection campaign , schröder criticized the stringent parameters laid out in the pact .
with staggering unemployment of nearly 4.5 million - the highest level since german reunification - and uncertainty about the extent to which reforms of germany 's social system and labor market - it is unlikely germany will be able to meet its own goals for balancing the budget .
" a balanced 2006 budget would require growth rates that i can not expect and if achieving this meant cutting spending as much as revenues are falling , or giving up the 2005 tax reform , i would not be ready for it , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told zdf . a fierce political debate schröder is currently seeking to push through a package of reforms that will reduce unemployment and retirement benefits that are pushing berlin 's deficit spending through the roof .
the plan also calls for a loosening of the country 's labor laws to make hiring and firing easier . but schröder is facing considerable resistance from deeply entrenched unions as well as the left wing of his own party , the social democrats .
the somnambulistic pace of negotiations surrounding the reform package has forced the government to undertake other measures to fill the budget gap . last week , the government announced it would increase its tax on cigarettes by € 1 per pack .
despite that effort , berlin is still anticipating a budget shortfall in excess of the previously planned 18.9 billion .
still , the cigarette tax is only expected to bring in € 4 billion for the country 's public healthcare fund , which is itself anticipating a € 4.5 billion shortfall .
opposition politicians have warned the government against any increases to the federal sales tax , which is currently 16 percent .
for his part , eichel says the government is still planning to better balance its budget .
" we have n't failed in consolidating -lrb- the budget -rrb- , it 's just going to take longer , " eichel said his interview with der spiegel .
the eu has already issued an " excessive deficit procedure " against germany and the country faces massive fines if it is unable to balance its budget by 2006 .
it remains possible that the german government may be forced to introduce future tax increases in its bid to balance the books and escape eu action . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions propose alternative to government reforms germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .
but the plan was immediately rejected by both the government and economic experts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2003 eu warns germany over budget deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel has an expensive headache .
germany says its budget deficit will exceed the legal limits stipulated by the pact regulating the euro for the second year .
the news has brussels shaking its finger and the opposition calling for heads to roll . despite plans to reform its labor market and social system , germany will fail to meet the criteria of the european union pact ensuring the stability of its common currency , the euro , in 2003 .
nor will it be able to achieve a balanced budget as previously planned by 2006 .
" we ca n't make it by 2006 any more unless there is an economic miracle , " finance minister hans eichel told the newsweekly der spiegel over the weekend .
but in a country with unemployment at nearly 4.5 million and growing , an economic miracle is highly unlikely .
the news comes as a political blow to eichel , who has made shrinking deficit spending and balancing the federal budget his key policy goal .
until recently , eichel had forecast a cut in deficit spending to 2.7 percent this year .
opposition politicians immediately demanded eichel 's resignation .
" i 'm not one to make regular resignation demands , " said friedrich merz , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union .
" but what has happened in the past days , surely that is enough reason to say that the finance minister has failed across the board and personally , too . "
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has come out in support of his finance minister , telling public broadcaster zdf on monday that " there is no discussion about eichel " and that he could keep his ministry post through the end of his term in 2006 .
a fiscal flu germany is not alone in straying from the stability pact 's stringent criteria - and eu leaders fear the fiscal flu could spread to other euro zone countries .
france has also had its name added to the eu 's fiscal " black book . "
france has repeatedly stated it will not meet the rules of the pact , which stipulates that government deficit spending may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
with both germany and france failing to meet the requirements , european union officials fear other countries will have less motivation to follow the pact and that , ultimately , the euro could be weakened .
" -lrb- european economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro -rrb- solbes is afraid that if germany fails to meet the three percent limit three consecutive times that the french and italians wo n't see any reason to continue to adhere to the stability pact , " an unnamed german government source told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes in a telephone conversation with eichel over the weekend , solbes warned germany that it must adhere to the provisions of the stability and growth pact by 2004 .
" next year , the nominal deficit must fall below the 3 percent limit , " a spokesman for solbes told the newspaper .
but solbes ' warning may find little resonance in berlin .
chancellor schröder himself has questioned the logic of the 3-percent ceiling on deficit spending .
during the devastating floods last summer in eastern germany and again during his reelection campaign , schröder criticized the stringent parameters laid out in the pact .
with staggering unemployment of nearly 4.5 million - the highest level since german reunification - and uncertainty about the extent to which reforms of germany 's social system and labor market - it is unlikely germany will be able to meet its own goals for balancing the budget .
" a balanced 2006 budget would require growth rates that i can not expect and if achieving this meant cutting spending as much as revenues are falling , or giving up the 2005 tax reform , i would not be ready for it , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told zdf . a fierce political debate schröder is currently seeking to push through a package of reforms that will reduce unemployment and retirement benefits that are pushing berlin 's deficit spending through the roof .
the plan also calls for a loosening of the country 's labor laws to make hiring and firing easier . but schröder is facing considerable resistance from deeply entrenched unions as well as the left wing of his own party , the social democrats .
the somnambulistic pace of negotiations surrounding the reform package has forced the government to undertake other measures to fill the budget gap . last week , the government announced it would increase its tax on cigarettes by € 1 per pack .
despite that effort , berlin is still anticipating a budget shortfall in excess of the previously planned 18.9 billion .
still , the cigarette tax is only expected to bring in € 4 billion for the country 's public healthcare fund , which is itself anticipating a € 4.5 billion shortfall .
opposition politicians have warned the government against any increases to the federal sales tax , which is currently 16 percent .
for his part , eichel says the government is still planning to better balance its budget .
" we have n't failed in consolidating -lrb- the budget -rrb- , it 's just going to take longer , " eichel said his interview with der spiegel .
the eu has already issued an " excessive deficit procedure " against germany and the country faces massive fines if it is unable to balance its budget by 2006 .
it remains possible that the german government may be forced to introduce future tax increases in its bid to balance the books and escape eu action . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions propose alternative to government reforms germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .

germany says its budget deficit will exceed the legal limits stipulated by the pact regulating the euro for the second year .
the news has brussels shaking its finger and the opposition calling for heads to roll . despite plans to reform its labor market and social system , germany will fail to meet the criteria of the european union pact ensuring the stability of its common currency , the euro , in 2003 .
nor will it be able to achieve a balanced budget as previously planned by 2006 .
" we ca n't make it by 2006 any more unless there is an economic miracle , " finance minister hans eichel told the newsweekly der spiegel over the weekend .
but in a country with unemployment at nearly 4.5 million and growing , an economic miracle is highly unlikely .
the news comes as a political blow to eichel , who has made shrinking deficit spending and balancing the federal budget his key policy goal .
until recently , eichel had forecast a cut in deficit spending to 2.7 percent this year .
opposition politicians immediately demanded eichel 's resignation .
" i 'm not one to make regular resignation demands , " said friedrich merz , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union .
" but what has happened in the past days , surely that is enough reason to say that the finance minister has failed across the board and personally , too . "
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has come out in support of his finance minister , telling public broadcaster zdf on monday that " there is no discussion about eichel " and that he could keep his ministry post through the end of his term in 2006 .
a fiscal flu germany is not alone in straying from the stability pact 's stringent criteria - and eu leaders fear the fiscal flu could spread to other euro zone countries .
france has also had its name added to the eu 's fiscal " black book . "
france has repeatedly stated it will not meet the rules of the pact , which stipulates that government deficit spending may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
with both germany and france failing to meet the requirements , european union officials fear other countries will have less motivation to follow the pact and that , ultimately , the euro could be weakened .
" -lrb- european economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro -rrb- solbes is afraid that if germany fails to meet the three percent limit three consecutive times that the french and italians wo n't see any reason to continue to adhere to the stability pact , " an unnamed german government source told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes in a telephone conversation with eichel over the weekend , solbes warned germany that it must adhere to the provisions of the stability and growth pact by 2004 .
" next year , the nominal deficit must fall below the 3 percent limit , " a spokesman for solbes told the newspaper .
but solbes ' warning may find little resonance in berlin .
chancellor schröder himself has questioned the logic of the 3-percent ceiling on deficit spending .
during the devastating floods last summer in eastern germany and again during his reelection campaign , schröder criticized the stringent parameters laid out in the pact .
with staggering unemployment of nearly 4.5 million - the highest level since german reunification - and uncertainty about the extent to which reforms of germany 's social system and labor market - it is unlikely germany will be able to meet its own goals for balancing the budget .
" a balanced 2006 budget would require growth rates that i can not expect and if achieving this meant cutting spending as much as revenues are falling , or giving up the 2005 tax reform , i would not be ready for it , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told zdf . a fierce political debate schröder is currently seeking to push through a package of reforms that will reduce unemployment and retirement benefits that are pushing berlin 's deficit spending through the roof .
the plan also calls for a loosening of the country 's labor laws to make hiring and firing easier . but schröder is facing considerable resistance from deeply entrenched unions as well as the left wing of his own party , the social democrats .
the somnambulistic pace of negotiations surrounding the reform package has forced the government to undertake other measures to fill the budget gap . last week , the government announced it would increase its tax on cigarettes by € 1 per pack .
despite that effort , berlin is still anticipating a budget shortfall in excess of the previously planned 18.9 billion .
still , the cigarette tax is only expected to bring in € 4 billion for the country 's public healthcare fund , which is itself anticipating a € 4.5 billion shortfall .
opposition politicians have warned the government against any increases to the federal sales tax , which is currently 16 percent .
for his part , eichel says the government is still planning to better balance its budget .
" we have n't failed in consolidating -lrb- the budget -rrb- , it 's just going to take longer , " eichel said his interview with der spiegel .
the eu has already issued an " excessive deficit procedure " against germany and the country faces massive fines if it is unable to balance its budget by 2006 .
it remains possible that the german government may be forced to introduce future tax increases in its bid to balance the books and escape eu action . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions propose alternative to government reforms germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .

on monday , the government officially launched a program that will introduce all-day schools across the country for the first time . german education minister edelgard bulmahn signed an agreement between the federal government and the german states that will lead to the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools nationwide . an investment in learning as part of its € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- investment program in the federal education system , the german government said it would set up a new independent agency to develop and evaluate educational standards nationwide as well as an expert commission to oversee education across the country . around € 300 million will be made available this year for individual german states to set up the all-day schools for children aged 6-16 .
a further € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- will be paid out over the next three years , with € 700 million -lrb- $ 810 million -rrb- to be invested in 2007 . " we need a new culture of optimism for education , " bulmahn said in a statement , adding that all day schooling would offer more time for learning and provide " more variety in education . " currently , the majority of schools in germany operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . improving education in a study released by the organization for economic cooperation and development last year know as the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , germany scored well below average , joining italy , hungary and poland in the bottom third . the study also revealed that german school children had poor reading skills and less knowledge of mathematics than students in other countries . many teachers in germany are in favor of the educational reforms .
a survey commissioned by the germany 's teacher 's union last year revealed that more than half would welcome a longer school day . parents are also expected to benefit from being able to send their children to school for the entire day .
many argue that half-day schooling prevents parents from being able to return to work . germany 's education ministry is counting on widespread support to help facilitate implementation of the ambitious plan .
having stressed last year that a good education system " is as important as the air we breathe , " bulmahn emphasized that establishing the new schools was a collective effort . " it 's important that the process of developing all-day schools is supported by the educational authorities and by the schools themselves , " bulmahn said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de education officials press ahead with work on standards after a new analysis of international test scores , school leaders in germany are refocusing efforts on establishing minimum learning standards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2003 eu warns germany over budget deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel has an expensive headache .
germany says its budget deficit will exceed the legal limits stipulated by the pact regulating the euro for the second year .
the news has brussels shaking its finger and the opposition calling for heads to roll . despite plans to reform its labor market and social system , germany will fail to meet the criteria of the european union pact ensuring the stability of its common currency , the euro , in 2003 .
nor will it be able to achieve a balanced budget as previously planned by 2006 .
" we ca n't make it by 2006 any more unless there is an economic miracle , " finance minister hans eichel told the newsweekly der spiegel over the weekend .
but in a country with unemployment at nearly 4.5 million and growing , an economic miracle is highly unlikely .
the news comes as a political blow to eichel , who has made shrinking deficit spending and balancing the federal budget his key policy goal .
until recently , eichel had forecast a cut in deficit spending to 2.7 percent this year .
opposition politicians immediately demanded eichel 's resignation .
" i 'm not one to make regular resignation demands , " said friedrich merz , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union .
" but what has happened in the past days , surely that is enough reason to say that the finance minister has failed across the board and personally , too . "
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has come out in support of his finance minister , telling public broadcaster zdf on monday that " there is no discussion about eichel " and that he could keep his ministry post through the end of his term in 2006 .
a fiscal flu germany is not alone in straying from the stability pact 's stringent criteria - and eu leaders fear the fiscal flu could spread to other euro zone countries .
france has also had its name added to the eu 's fiscal " black book . "
france has repeatedly stated it will not meet the rules of the pact , which stipulates that government deficit spending may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
with both germany and france failing to meet the requirements , european union officials fear other countries will have less motivation to follow the pact and that , ultimately , the euro could be weakened .
" -lrb- european economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro -rrb- solbes is afraid that if germany fails to meet the three percent limit three consecutive times that the french and italians wo n't see any reason to continue to adhere to the stability pact , " an unnamed german government source told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes in a telephone conversation with eichel over the weekend , solbes warned germany that it must adhere to the provisions of the stability and growth pact by 2004 .
" next year , the nominal deficit must fall below the 3 percent limit , " a spokesman for solbes told the newspaper .
but solbes ' warning may find little resonance in berlin .
chancellor schröder himself has questioned the logic of the 3-percent ceiling on deficit spending .
during the devastating floods last summer in eastern germany and again during his reelection campaign , schröder criticized the stringent parameters laid out in the pact .
with staggering unemployment of nearly 4.5 million - the highest level since german reunification - and uncertainty about the extent to which reforms of germany 's social system and labor market - it is unlikely germany will be able to meet its own goals for balancing the budget .
" a balanced 2006 budget would require growth rates that i can not expect and if achieving this meant cutting spending as much as revenues are falling , or giving up the 2005 tax reform , i would not be ready for it , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told zdf . a fierce political debate schröder is currently seeking to push through a package of reforms that will reduce unemployment and retirement benefits that are pushing berlin 's deficit spending through the roof .
the plan also calls for a loosening of the country 's labor laws to make hiring and firing easier . but schröder is facing considerable resistance from deeply entrenched unions as well as the left wing of his own party , the social democrats .
the somnambulistic pace of negotiations surrounding the reform package has forced the government to undertake other measures to fill the budget gap . last week , the government announced it would increase its tax on cigarettes by € 1 per pack .
despite that effort , berlin is still anticipating a budget shortfall in excess of the previously planned 18.9 billion .
still , the cigarette tax is only expected to bring in € 4 billion for the country 's public healthcare fund , which is itself anticipating a € 4.5 billion shortfall .
opposition politicians have warned the government against any increases to the federal sales tax , which is currently 16 percent .
for his part , eichel says the government is still planning to better balance its budget .
" we have n't failed in consolidating -lrb- the budget -rrb- , it 's just going to take longer , " eichel said his interview with der spiegel .
the eu has already issued an " excessive deficit procedure " against germany and the country faces massive fines if it is unable to balance its budget by 2006 .
it remains possible that the german government may be forced to introduce future tax increases in its bid to balance the books and escape eu action . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions propose alternative to government reforms germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2003 eu warns germany over budget deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel has an expensive headache .
germany says its budget deficit will exceed the legal limits stipulated by the pact regulating the euro for the second year .
the news has brussels shaking its finger and the opposition calling for heads to roll . despite plans to reform its labor market and social system , germany will fail to meet the criteria of the european union pact ensuring the stability of its common currency , the euro , in 2003 .
nor will it be able to achieve a balanced budget as previously planned by 2006 .
" we ca n't make it by 2006 any more unless there is an economic miracle , " finance minister hans eichel told the newsweekly der spiegel over the weekend .
but in a country with unemployment at nearly 4.5 million and growing , an economic miracle is highly unlikely .
the news comes as a political blow to eichel , who has made shrinking deficit spending and balancing the federal budget his key policy goal .
until recently , eichel had forecast a cut in deficit spending to 2.7 percent this year .
opposition politicians immediately demanded eichel 's resignation .
" i 'm not one to make regular resignation demands , " said friedrich merz , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union .
" but what has happened in the past days , surely that is enough reason to say that the finance minister has failed across the board and personally , too . "
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has come out in support of his finance minister , telling public broadcaster zdf on monday that " there is no discussion about eichel " and that he could keep his ministry post through the end of his term in 2006 .
a fiscal flu germany is not alone in straying from the stability pact 's stringent criteria - and eu leaders fear the fiscal flu could spread to other euro zone countries .
france has also had its name added to the eu 's fiscal " black book . "
france has repeatedly stated it will not meet the rules of the pact , which stipulates that government deficit spending may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
with both germany and france failing to meet the requirements , european union officials fear other countries will have less motivation to follow the pact and that , ultimately , the euro could be weakened .
" -lrb- european economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro -rrb- solbes is afraid that if germany fails to meet the three percent limit three consecutive times that the french and italians wo n't see any reason to continue to adhere to the stability pact , " an unnamed german government source told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes in a telephone conversation with eichel over the weekend , solbes warned germany that it must adhere to the provisions of the stability and growth pact by 2004 .
" next year , the nominal deficit must fall below the 3 percent limit , " a spokesman for solbes told the newspaper .
but solbes ' warning may find little resonance in berlin .
chancellor schröder himself has questioned the logic of the 3-percent ceiling on deficit spending .
during the devastating floods last summer in eastern germany and again during his reelection campaign , schröder criticized the stringent parameters laid out in the pact .
with staggering unemployment of nearly 4.5 million - the highest level since german reunification - and uncertainty about the extent to which reforms of germany 's social system and labor market - it is unlikely germany will be able to meet its own goals for balancing the budget .
" a balanced 2006 budget would require growth rates that i can not expect and if achieving this meant cutting spending as much as revenues are falling , or giving up the 2005 tax reform , i would not be ready for it , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told zdf . a fierce political debate schröder is currently seeking to push through a package of reforms that will reduce unemployment and retirement benefits that are pushing berlin 's deficit spending through the roof .
the plan also calls for a loosening of the country 's labor laws to make hiring and firing easier . but schröder is facing considerable resistance from deeply entrenched unions as well as the left wing of his own party , the social democrats .
the somnambulistic pace of negotiations surrounding the reform package has forced the government to undertake other measures to fill the budget gap . last week , the government announced it would increase its tax on cigarettes by € 1 per pack .
despite that effort , berlin is still anticipating a budget shortfall in excess of the previously planned 18.9 billion .
still , the cigarette tax is only expected to bring in € 4 billion for the country 's public healthcare fund , which is itself anticipating a € 4.5 billion shortfall .
opposition politicians have warned the government against any increases to the federal sales tax , which is currently 16 percent .
for his part , eichel says the government is still planning to better balance its budget .
" we have n't failed in consolidating -lrb- the budget -rrb- , it 's just going to take longer , " eichel said his interview with der spiegel .
the eu has already issued an " excessive deficit procedure " against germany and the country faces massive fines if it is unable to balance its budget by 2006 .

nor will it be able to achieve a balanced budget as previously planned by 2006 .
" we ca n't make it by 2006 any more unless there is an economic miracle , " finance minister hans eichel told the newsweekly der spiegel over the weekend .
but in a country with unemployment at nearly 4.5 million and growing , an economic miracle is highly unlikely .
the news comes as a political blow to eichel , who has made shrinking deficit spending and balancing the federal budget his key policy goal .
until recently , eichel had forecast a cut in deficit spending to 2.7 percent this year .
opposition politicians immediately demanded eichel 's resignation .
" i 'm not one to make regular resignation demands , " said friedrich merz , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union .
" but what has happened in the past days , surely that is enough reason to say that the finance minister has failed across the board and personally , too . "

germany says its budget deficit will exceed the legal limits stipulated by the pact regulating the euro for the second year .
the news has brussels shaking its finger and the opposition calling for heads to roll . despite plans to reform its labor market and social system , germany will fail to meet the criteria of the european union pact ensuring the stability of its common currency , the euro , in 2003 .
nor will it be able to achieve a balanced budget as previously planned by 2006 .
" we ca n't make it by 2006 any more unless there is an economic miracle , " finance minister hans eichel told the newsweekly der spiegel over the weekend .
but in a country with unemployment at nearly 4.5 million and growing , an economic miracle is highly unlikely .
the news comes as a political blow to eichel , who has made shrinking deficit spending and balancing the federal budget his key policy goal .
until recently , eichel had forecast a cut in deficit spending to 2.7 percent this year .
opposition politicians immediately demanded eichel 's resignation .
" i 'm not one to make regular resignation demands , " said friedrich merz , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union .
" but what has happened in the past days , surely that is enough reason to say that the finance minister has failed across the board and personally , too . "
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has come out in support of his finance minister , telling public broadcaster zdf on monday that " there is no discussion about eichel " and that he could keep his ministry post through the end of his term in 2006 .
a fiscal flu germany is not alone in straying from the stability pact 's stringent criteria - and eu leaders fear the fiscal flu could spread to other euro zone countries .
france has also had its name added to the eu 's fiscal " black book . "
france has repeatedly stated it will not meet the rules of the pact , which stipulates that government deficit spending may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
with both germany and france failing to meet the requirements , european union officials fear other countries will have less motivation to follow the pact and that , ultimately , the euro could be weakened .
" -lrb- european economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro -rrb- solbes is afraid that if germany fails to meet the three percent limit three consecutive times that the french and italians wo n't see any reason to continue to adhere to the stability pact , " an unnamed german government source told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes in a telephone conversation with eichel over the weekend , solbes warned germany that it must adhere to the provisions of the stability and growth pact by 2004 .
" next year , the nominal deficit must fall below the 3 percent limit , " a spokesman for solbes told the newspaper .
but solbes ' warning may find little resonance in berlin .
chancellor schröder himself has questioned the logic of the 3-percent ceiling on deficit spending .
during the devastating floods last summer in eastern germany and again during his reelection campaign , schröder criticized the stringent parameters laid out in the pact .
with staggering unemployment of nearly 4.5 million - the highest level since german reunification - and uncertainty about the extent to which reforms of germany 's social system and labor market - it is unlikely germany will be able to meet its own goals for balancing the budget .
" a balanced 2006 budget would require growth rates that i can not expect and if achieving this meant cutting spending as much as revenues are falling , or giving up the 2005 tax reform , i would not be ready for it , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told zdf . a fierce political debate schröder is currently seeking to push through a package of reforms that will reduce unemployment and retirement benefits that are pushing berlin 's deficit spending through the roof .
the plan also calls for a loosening of the country 's labor laws to make hiring and firing easier . but schröder is facing considerable resistance from deeply entrenched unions as well as the left wing of his own party , the social democrats .
the somnambulistic pace of negotiations surrounding the reform package has forced the government to undertake other measures to fill the budget gap . last week , the government announced it would increase its tax on cigarettes by € 1 per pack .
despite that effort , berlin is still anticipating a budget shortfall in excess of the previously planned 18.9 billion .
still , the cigarette tax is only expected to bring in € 4 billion for the country 's public healthcare fund , which is itself anticipating a € 4.5 billion shortfall .
opposition politicians have warned the government against any increases to the federal sales tax , which is currently 16 percent .
for his part , eichel says the government is still planning to better balance its budget .
" we have n't failed in consolidating -lrb- the budget -rrb- , it 's just going to take longer , " eichel said his interview with der spiegel .
the eu has already issued an " excessive deficit procedure " against germany and the country faces massive fines if it is unable to balance its budget by 2006 .

on monday , the government officially launched a program that will introduce all-day schools across the country for the first time . german education minister edelgard bulmahn signed an agreement between the federal government and the german states that will lead to the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools nationwide . an investment in learning as part of its € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- investment program in the federal education system , the german government said it would set up a new independent agency to develop and evaluate educational standards nationwide as well as an expert commission to oversee education across the country . around € 300 million will be made available this year for individual german states to set up the all-day schools for children aged 6-16 .
a further € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- will be paid out over the next three years , with € 700 million -lrb- $ 810 million -rrb- to be invested in 2007 . " we need a new culture of optimism for education , " bulmahn said in a statement , adding that all day schooling would offer more time for learning and provide " more variety in education . " currently , the majority of schools in germany operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . improving education in a study released by the organization for economic cooperation and development last year know as the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , germany scored well below average , joining italy , hungary and poland in the bottom third . the study also revealed that german school children had poor reading skills and less knowledge of mathematics than students in other countries . many teachers in germany are in favor of the educational reforms .
a survey commissioned by the germany 's teacher 's union last year revealed that more than half would welcome a longer school day . parents are also expected to benefit from being able to send their children to school for the entire day .
many argue that half-day schooling prevents parents from being able to return to work . germany 's education ministry is counting on widespread support to help facilitate implementation of the ambitious plan .
having stressed last year that a good education system " is as important as the air we breathe , " bulmahn emphasized that establishing the new schools was a collective effort . " it 's important that the process of developing all-day schools is supported by the educational authorities and by the schools themselves , " bulmahn said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de education officials press ahead with work on standards after a new analysis of international test scores , school leaders in germany are refocusing efforts on establishing minimum learning standards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2003 eu warns germany over budget deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel has an expensive headache .
germany says its budget deficit will exceed the legal limits stipulated by the pact regulating the euro for the second year .
the news has brussels shaking its finger and the opposition calling for heads to roll . despite plans to reform its labor market and social system , germany will fail to meet the criteria of the european union pact ensuring the stability of its common currency , the euro , in 2003 .
nor will it be able to achieve a balanced budget as previously planned by 2006 .
" we ca n't make it by 2006 any more unless there is an economic miracle , " finance minister hans eichel told the newsweekly der spiegel over the weekend .
but in a country with unemployment at nearly 4.5 million and growing , an economic miracle is highly unlikely .
the news comes as a political blow to eichel , who has made shrinking deficit spending and balancing the federal budget his key policy goal .
until recently , eichel had forecast a cut in deficit spending to 2.7 percent this year .
opposition politicians immediately demanded eichel 's resignation .
" i 'm not one to make regular resignation demands , " said friedrich merz , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union .
" but what has happened in the past days , surely that is enough reason to say that the finance minister has failed across the board and personally , too . "
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has come out in support of his finance minister , telling public broadcaster zdf on monday that " there is no discussion about eichel " and that he could keep his ministry post through the end of his term in 2006 .
a fiscal flu germany is not alone in straying from the stability pact 's stringent criteria - and eu leaders fear the fiscal flu could spread to other euro zone countries .
france has also had its name added to the eu 's fiscal " black book . "
france has repeatedly stated it will not meet the rules of the pact , which stipulates that government deficit spending may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
with both germany and france failing to meet the requirements , european union officials fear other countries will have less motivation to follow the pact and that , ultimately , the euro could be weakened .
" -lrb- european economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro -rrb- solbes is afraid that if germany fails to meet the three percent limit three consecutive times that the french and italians wo n't see any reason to continue to adhere to the stability pact , " an unnamed german government source told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes in a telephone conversation with eichel over the weekend , solbes warned germany that it must adhere to the provisions of the stability and growth pact by 2004 .
" next year , the nominal deficit must fall below the 3 percent limit , " a spokesman for solbes told the newspaper .
but solbes ' warning may find little resonance in berlin .
chancellor schröder himself has questioned the logic of the 3-percent ceiling on deficit spending .
during the devastating floods last summer in eastern germany and again during his reelection campaign , schröder criticized the stringent parameters laid out in the pact .
with staggering unemployment of nearly 4.5 million - the highest level since german reunification - and uncertainty about the extent to which reforms of germany 's social system and labor market - it is unlikely germany will be able to meet its own goals for balancing the budget .
" a balanced 2006 budget would require growth rates that i can not expect and if achieving this meant cutting spending as much as revenues are falling , or giving up the 2005 tax reform , i would not be ready for it , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told zdf . a fierce political debate schröder is currently seeking to push through a package of reforms that will reduce unemployment and retirement benefits that are pushing berlin 's deficit spending through the roof .
the plan also calls for a loosening of the country 's labor laws to make hiring and firing easier . but schröder is facing considerable resistance from deeply entrenched unions as well as the left wing of his own party , the social democrats .
the somnambulistic pace of negotiations surrounding the reform package has forced the government to undertake other measures to fill the budget gap . last week , the government announced it would increase its tax on cigarettes by € 1 per pack .
despite that effort , berlin is still anticipating a budget shortfall in excess of the previously planned 18.9 billion .
still , the cigarette tax is only expected to bring in € 4 billion for the country 's public healthcare fund , which is itself anticipating a € 4.5 billion shortfall .
opposition politicians have warned the government against any increases to the federal sales tax , which is currently 16 percent .
for his part , eichel says the government is still planning to better balance its budget .
" we have n't failed in consolidating -lrb- the budget -rrb- , it 's just going to take longer , " eichel said his interview with der spiegel .
the eu has already issued an " excessive deficit procedure " against germany and the country faces massive fines if it is unable to balance its budget by 2006 .
it remains possible that the german government may be forced to introduce future tax increases in its bid to balance the books and escape eu action . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions propose alternative to government reforms germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .
but the plan was immediately rejected by both the government and economic experts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.05.2003 eu warns germany over budget deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german finance minister hans eichel has an expensive headache .
germany says its budget deficit will exceed the legal limits stipulated by the pact regulating the euro for the second year .
the news has brussels shaking its finger and the opposition calling for heads to roll . despite plans to reform its labor market and social system , germany will fail to meet the criteria of the european union pact ensuring the stability of its common currency , the euro , in 2003 .
nor will it be able to achieve a balanced budget as previously planned by 2006 .
" we ca n't make it by 2006 any more unless there is an economic miracle , " finance minister hans eichel told the newsweekly der spiegel over the weekend .
but in a country with unemployment at nearly 4.5 million and growing , an economic miracle is highly unlikely .
the news comes as a political blow to eichel , who has made shrinking deficit spending and balancing the federal budget his key policy goal .
until recently , eichel had forecast a cut in deficit spending to 2.7 percent this year .
opposition politicians immediately demanded eichel 's resignation .
" i 'm not one to make regular resignation demands , " said friedrich merz , the deputy chairman of the parliamentary group of the conservative christian democratic union .
" but what has happened in the past days , surely that is enough reason to say that the finance minister has failed across the board and personally , too . "
but german chancellor gerhard schröder has come out in support of his finance minister , telling public broadcaster zdf on monday that " there is no discussion about eichel " and that he could keep his ministry post through the end of his term in 2006 .
a fiscal flu germany is not alone in straying from the stability pact 's stringent criteria - and eu leaders fear the fiscal flu could spread to other euro zone countries .
france has also had its name added to the eu 's fiscal " black book . "
france has repeatedly stated it will not meet the rules of the pact , which stipulates that government deficit spending may not exceed 3 percent of gross domestic product .
with both germany and france failing to meet the requirements , european union officials fear other countries will have less motivation to follow the pact and that , ultimately , the euro could be weakened .
" -lrb- european economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro -rrb- solbes is afraid that if germany fails to meet the three percent limit three consecutive times that the french and italians wo n't see any reason to continue to adhere to the stability pact , " an unnamed german government source told the financial times deutschland newspaper .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu economic and monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes in a telephone conversation with eichel over the weekend , solbes warned germany that it must adhere to the provisions of the stability and growth pact by 2004 .
" next year , the nominal deficit must fall below the 3 percent limit , " a spokesman for solbes told the newspaper .
but solbes ' warning may find little resonance in berlin .
chancellor schröder himself has questioned the logic of the 3-percent ceiling on deficit spending .
during the devastating floods last summer in eastern germany and again during his reelection campaign , schröder criticized the stringent parameters laid out in the pact .
with staggering unemployment of nearly 4.5 million - the highest level since german reunification - and uncertainty about the extent to which reforms of germany 's social system and labor market - it is unlikely germany will be able to meet its own goals for balancing the budget .
" a balanced 2006 budget would require growth rates that i can not expect and if achieving this meant cutting spending as much as revenues are falling , or giving up the 2005 tax reform , i would not be ready for it , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told zdf . a fierce political debate schröder is currently seeking to push through a package of reforms that will reduce unemployment and retirement benefits that are pushing berlin 's deficit spending through the roof .
the plan also calls for a loosening of the country 's labor laws to make hiring and firing easier . but schröder is facing considerable resistance from deeply entrenched unions as well as the left wing of his own party , the social democrats .
the somnambulistic pace of negotiations surrounding the reform package has forced the government to undertake other measures to fill the budget gap . last week , the government announced it would increase its tax on cigarettes by € 1 per pack .
despite that effort , berlin is still anticipating a budget shortfall in excess of the previously planned 18.9 billion .
still , the cigarette tax is only expected to bring in € 4 billion for the country 's public healthcare fund , which is itself anticipating a € 4.5 billion shortfall .
opposition politicians have warned the government against any increases to the federal sales tax , which is currently 16 percent .
for his part , eichel says the government is still planning to better balance its budget .
" we have n't failed in consolidating -lrb- the budget -rrb- , it 's just going to take longer , " eichel said his interview with der spiegel .
the eu has already issued an " excessive deficit procedure " against germany and the country faces massive fines if it is unable to balance its budget by 2006 .
it remains possible that the german government may be forced to introduce future tax increases in its bid to balance the books and escape eu action . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german unions propose alternative to government reforms germany ’ s powerful trade unions proposed a massive borrowing and investment program to spur growth and cut unemployment on thursday .

on monday , the government officially launched a program that will introduce all-day schools across the country for the first time . german education minister edelgard bulmahn signed an agreement between the federal government and the german states that will lead to the establishment of 10,000 all-day schools nationwide . an investment in learning as part of its € 4 billion -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- investment program in the federal education system , the german government said it would set up a new independent agency to develop and evaluate educational standards nationwide as well as an expert commission to oversee education across the country . around € 300 million will be made available this year for individual german states to set up the all-day schools for children aged 6-16 .
a further € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- will be paid out over the next three years , with € 700 million -lrb- $ 810 million -rrb- to be invested in 2007 . " we need a new culture of optimism for education , " bulmahn said in a statement , adding that all day schooling would offer more time for learning and provide " more variety in education . " currently , the majority of schools in germany operate on a half-day basis , with lessons ending around lunchtime . improving education in a study released by the organization for economic cooperation and development last year know as the program for international student assessment -lrb- pisa -rrb- , germany scored well below average , joining italy , hungary and poland in the bottom third . the study also revealed that german school children had poor reading skills and less knowledge of mathematics than students in other countries . many teachers in germany are in favor of the educational reforms .
a survey commissioned by the germany 's teacher 's union last year revealed that more than half would welcome a longer school day . parents are also expected to benefit from being able to send their children to school for the entire day .
many argue that half-day schooling prevents parents from being able to return to work . germany 's education ministry is counting on widespread support to help facilitate implementation of the ambitious plan .
having stressed last year that a good education system " is as important as the air we breathe , " bulmahn emphasized that establishing the new schools was a collective effort . " it 's important that the process of developing all-day schools is supported by the educational authorities and by the schools themselves , " bulmahn said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de education officials press ahead with work on standards after a new analysis of international test scores , school leaders in germany are refocusing efforts on establishing minimum learning standards .

the workers returned to a full strike after scaling back their action last week during talks between the two sides .
the original action was called by the histadrut labour federation 10 days ago after finance minister binyamin netanyahu unveiled 10 % cuts across the board for ministry budgets .
mr netanyahu and histadrut chairman amir peretz met on sunday to try to move forward in discussions over the proposed economic plan .
but despite seven hours of talks , they made little progress in bridging the gulf between the two sides ' positions .
and mr peretz warned that the strike could widen to embrace the whole public sector again on tuesday , unless the government shows signs of compromise by monday evening .
limited standstill at the centre of the dispute are mr netanyahu 's proposed pay cuts for public sector workers .
the finance ministry is proposing cuts of between 8-9 % while reports have suggested the histadrut will accept a 4 % reduction .
the measures are part of the government 's 11bn shekel -lrb- $ 2.4bn ; £ 1.5bn -rrb- economic plan , aimed at resuscitating the country 's worst ever recession and reducing a 16bn shekel hole in the country 's finances .
a spokesman for the histadrut said on sunday that 55,000 workers had walked out from offices including the interior ministry , national insurance institute -lrb- nii -rrb- and many other services .
earlier , mr peretz had accused mr netanyahu of dragging his feet in negotiations so that parliament would vote on the proposed economic plan before the crisis was resolved .
more delays workers at ben-gurion international airport joined the striking public sector workers on sunday afternoon , meaning delays for most outgoing flights .
staff also held up the loading and off-loading of baggage from incoming and departing flights .
in addition , customs workers are threatening not to release goods arriving at the country 's air and sea ports , while welfare services wo n't be provided and parking fines wo n't be issued .
schools were open after an agreement was reached between the teachers association and the education and finance ministries .
the teachers agreed not to strike in return for the education ministry 's promise not to sack teachers who are union members .
the initial two-day strike 10 days ago , launched in response to the parliament 's first vote on the economic package , had paralysed the country after 700,000 workers shut down much of israel 's infrastructure .
two more votes are needed for the package to become law .

the original action was called by the histadrut labour federation 10 days ago after finance minister binyamin netanyahu unveiled 10 % cuts across the board for ministry budgets .
mr netanyahu and histadrut chairman amir peretz met on sunday to try to move forward in discussions over the proposed economic plan .
but despite seven hours of talks , they made little progress in bridging the gulf between the two sides ' positions .
and mr peretz warned that the strike could widen to embrace the whole public sector again on tuesday , unless the government shows signs of compromise by monday evening .
limited standstill at the centre of the dispute are mr netanyahu 's proposed pay cuts for public sector workers .
the finance ministry is proposing cuts of between 8-9 % while reports have suggested the histadrut will accept a 4 % reduction .
the measures are part of the government 's 11bn shekel -lrb- $ 2.4bn ; £ 1.5bn -rrb- economic plan , aimed at resuscitating the country 's worst ever recession and reducing a 16bn shekel hole in the country 's finances .
a spokesman for the histadrut said on sunday that 55,000 workers had walked out from offices including the interior ministry , national insurance institute -lrb- nii -rrb- and many other services .
earlier , mr peretz had accused mr netanyahu of dragging his feet in negotiations so that parliament would vote on the proposed economic plan before the crisis was resolved .
more delays workers at ben-gurion international airport joined the striking public sector workers on sunday afternoon , meaning delays for most outgoing flights .
staff also held up the loading and off-loading of baggage from incoming and departing flights .
in addition , customs workers are threatening not to release goods arriving at the country 's air and sea ports , while welfare services wo n't be provided and parking fines wo n't be issued .
schools were open after an agreement was reached between the teachers association and the education and finance ministries .
the teachers agreed not to strike in return for the education ministry 's promise not to sack teachers who are union members .
the initial two-day strike 10 days ago , launched in response to the parliament 's first vote on the economic package , had paralysed the country after 700,000 workers shut down much of israel 's infrastructure .
two more votes are needed for the package to become law .

the ex-beatle performed for almost three hours , singing 1960 classics back in the ussr , hey jude and yesterday , as well as material from his solo career .
on saturday , mccartney performed in front of 400 fans inside the 2,000-year-old colosseum at a benefit concert .
fans had paid up to 1,295 euros -lrb- £ 930 -rrb- each for a ticket to the concert inside the colosseum , which is rarely open for performances .
" we understand it 's the first time there 's been a band in the colosseum since the christians , " mccartney joked with the audience .
profits for saturday 's show went to rome 's archaeological offices and to adopt-a-minefield , the anti-landmines charity backed by the singer and his wife , heather mills .
the ex-beatle had to urge fans to go home a day later and some fans had started staking out places 12 hours before the concert started in an area flanking rome 's ancient forums .
" you have to go home , " mccartney shouted as the crowd remained after midnight in the fori imperiali linking the central piazza venezia with the colosseum .
surrounded by a troupe of dancers who had opened the show , as well as his own musicians , mccartney concluded the show in italian : " grazie roma , arrivederci roma . "

three years ago seagulls were a significant problem at the chelson meadow landfill site in plymouth .
now falcons are being used to get rid of the seagulls , who frighten the birds away without harming them , and gull numbers have reduced dramatically .
other local authorities around the country are now considering using the idea .
specialist firms according to the royal society for the protection of birds -lrb- rspb -rrb- , the loss of cliff-top breeding sites to coastal development and depleted fish stocks at sea are behind the growing inland migration of gulls .
rubbish tips are a magnet for the gulls , some of whom , according to the rspb , can live inland without ever seeing the sea during the course of their lifetimes .
councils are increasingly turning to specialist firms to provide bird-of-prey handlers .
there are only a handful of such companies in britain and business is growing .
main problem nbc environmental services , based in norfolk , supplies plymouth city council with its falcons and falconer .
the company breeds and trains specialised peregrine falcons and hawks to deter gulls and pigeons .
but the rspb says that although bird-scaring using birds of prey has been in use - chiefly by the raf and navy - for the past 20 years , it tends to move the birds around but ultimately does not control them .
the charity argues that moving the gulls off landfill sites does not tackle the main problem , namely the loss of their natural habitat and food supply .

main problem nbc environmental services , based in norfolk , supplies plymouth city council with its falcons and falconer .

the move is being considered to help reduce tooth decay among children in " deprived " areas , according to the sunday times .
such a measure would prove controversial as critics fear fluoride could be linked to increased risks of cancer , hip fractures , kidney trouble and birth defects .
but the government has previously insisted there is no evidence to support claims of health risks from adding chemicals to drinking water .
to medicate the whole population against their will is not the way to deal with tooth decay jane jones national pure water association only about 11 % of the population currently receive fluoridated water .
health authorities may get powers to increase fluoridation in drinking water rather than water companies under amendments to the water bill later this month , according to the paper .
it says it has seen a letter from health minister hazel blears and environment minister elliot morley dated in april to deputy prime minister john prescott , in his role as chairman of the domestic affairs cabinet committee .
the letter read : " those who remain adamantly opposed would be able to use water filters that remove fluoride or buy bottled drinking water . "
it went on : " experience of oral health promotion projects shows that it is much harder to establish regular tooth-brushing in deprived areas , because of the costs of toothpaste and , perhaps , because of the less ordered lifestyles lived by families . "
' nanny state ' it said the minority who opposed the move should not be allowed to stop fluoridation by continuing to insist on more research .
cabinet members may be allowed a free vote on the issue , according to the paper .
the campaign director of the national pure water association , jane jones , said : " there will undoubtedly be a huge row about the renewed proposal to add fluoride to the drinking water on a wide scale in the uk .
" this is nanny statism .
it is outrageous .
" to medicate the whole population against their will is not the way to deal with tooth decay . "
the green party is also among those opposing such a move .
health spokesman martyn shrewsbury said : " the general trend in the world is against fluoridation .
" it 's quite incredible that tony blair would want to fluoridate britain " .
he said this proposal would be against medical ethics as a patient must give consent to medication under the european convention of human rights .
mr shrewsbury also argued there was no proof that fluorinated water reduced the risk of tooth decay comparing fluoridated gateshead with non-fluoridated liverpool saying that they had the same level of tooth decay .
a department of health spokeswoman said last september ms blears had stated a report on fluoridation by the medical research council contained " nothing to suggest any reason why water fluoridation should not be considered as a public health measure in areas where dental health remains a serious problem " .
ian wylie , chief executive of the british dental association , said : " it 's tragic that , in 2003 , there are still children as young as five having most or even all of their teeth removed under general anaesthetic as the result of tooth decay .
" water fluoridation is a positive step in narrowing the health inequalities that currently exist .

the move is being considered to help reduce tooth decay among children in " deprived " areas , according to the sunday times .
such a measure would prove controversial as critics fear fluoride could be linked to increased risks of cancer , hip fractures , kidney trouble and birth defects .
but the government has previously insisted there is no evidence to support claims of health risks from adding chemicals to drinking water .
to medicate the whole population against their will is not the way to deal with tooth decay jane jones national pure water association only about 11 % of the population currently receive fluoridated water .
health authorities may get powers to increase fluoridation in drinking water rather than water companies under amendments to the water bill later this month , according to the paper .
it says it has seen a letter from health minister hazel blears and environment minister elliot morley dated in april to deputy prime minister john prescott , in his role as chairman of the domestic affairs cabinet committee .
the letter read : " those who remain adamantly opposed would be able to use water filters that remove fluoride or buy bottled drinking water . "
it went on : " experience of oral health promotion projects shows that it is much harder to establish regular tooth-brushing in deprived areas , because of the costs of toothpaste and , perhaps , because of the less ordered lifestyles lived by families . "
' nanny state ' it said the minority who opposed the move should not be allowed to stop fluoridation by continuing to insist on more research .
cabinet members may be allowed a free vote on the issue , according to the paper .
the campaign director of the national pure water association , jane jones , said : " there will undoubtedly be a huge row about the renewed proposal to add fluoride to the drinking water on a wide scale in the uk .
" this is nanny statism .
it is outrageous .
" to medicate the whole population against their will is not the way to deal with tooth decay . "
the green party is also among those opposing such a move .
health spokesman martyn shrewsbury said : " the general trend in the world is against fluoridation .
" it 's quite incredible that tony blair would want to fluoridate britain " .
he said this proposal would be against medical ethics as a patient must give consent to medication under the european convention of human rights .
mr shrewsbury also argued there was no proof that fluorinated water reduced the risk of tooth decay comparing fluoridated gateshead with non-fluoridated liverpool saying that they had the same level of tooth decay .
a department of health spokeswoman said last september ms blears had stated a report on fluoridation by the medical research council contained " nothing to suggest any reason why water fluoridation should not be considered as a public health measure in areas where dental health remains a serious problem " .
ian wylie , chief executive of the british dental association , said : " it 's tragic that , in 2003 , there are still children as young as five having most or even all of their teeth removed under general anaesthetic as the result of tooth decay .
" water fluoridation is a positive step in narrowing the health inequalities that currently exist .
" targeted water fluoridation is the one public health measure that would cause the largest improvement in the oral health of those in greatest need .
" the bda strongly supports any change that would allow the introduction of water fluoridation , after full consultation and with the agreement of the local community . "
