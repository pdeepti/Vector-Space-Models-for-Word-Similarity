the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .
the health reform bill is only the first of 11 pieces of legislation to be brought into parliament this autumn as part of schröder 's agenda 2010 reform platform .
in the past schröder has threatened to resign if his party refused to follow him in parliament .
the chancellor is said to have avoided this tactic on thursday , but reports said he warned members of parliament of the consequences of a loss of momentum in the reform process .
speaking to reporters after the vote , schröder ’ s spokesman bela anda said , " the chancellor does not threaten to resign .
but he emphasized the importance of the agenda 2010 measures being passed with an own -lrb- meaning spd-greens -rrb- majority . "
" it is important not only for the health care reform vote today but also for further votes down the road on agenda 2010 reforms , " he said .
the bill still requires approval from germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , but that body is expected to pass the law as soon as mid-october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system .

it was later revealed that dr. kelly was the person who passed on these doubts to the journalist . it is claimed that the imminent exposure from being named and pressure from the government finally led to kelly taking his own life .
gompertz said no credence should be given to gilligan 's account of his talks with kelly , except where it could be corroborated by independent sources . caught in the crossfire the reporting of the 45 minute claim put the bbc and the government on a collision course , and kelly ’ s lawyer pointed out in his closing address that the scientist was caught in the middle .

however , gompertz maintained that the weapons expert ’ s family were not looking for " revenge or retribution " on any " scapegoats " but wanted to help identify and correct " systemic failures " at the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- , dr. kelly ’ s employers . " never again should someone be put in such a position , " said gompertz , who accused both the government and the media for the " total lack of care " kelly received amid the frenzy surrounding his outing as the source for the bbc report that questioned an integral statement in the government ’ s iraq dossier . bbc man used kelly as source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan .
the bbc ’ s andrew gilligan reported in may on the radio program today , and then subsequently in the national newspaper the mail on sunday , that the claim that saddam hussein could have chemical and biological weapons ready in 45 minutes was included in the government 's dossier despite the fact officials knew it to be false .
it was later revealed that dr. kelly was the person who passed on these doubts to the journalist . it is claimed that the imminent exposure from being named and pressure from the government finally led to kelly taking his own life .
gompertz said no credence should be given to gilligan 's account of his talks with kelly , except where it could be corroborated by independent sources . caught in the crossfire the reporting of the 45 minute claim put the bbc and the government on a collision course , and kelly ’ s lawyer pointed out in his closing address that the scientist was caught in the middle .
gompertz attacked the " hypocrisy " of the british government for denying there was a strategy to use kelly in the dossier row with the bbc .
" this was a cynical abuse of power which deserves the strongest possible condemnation . " he concluded : " no wonder dr kelly felt betrayed after giving his life in service to the country ... in his despair , he seems to have taken his own life . " government cleared twice of wrong-doing both the hutton inquiry and the previous investigation by the foreign affairs committee have cleared the british government of deliberately inserting information known to be false but both have reprimanded the government for issuing misleading information and for not clarifying important data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
defense minister geoff hoon has been singled out for condemnation for his role in maintaining the ambiguity surrounding the 45 minute claim despite concerns raised by staff at the mod and for authorizing the press statement which led to dr kelly being named as the suspected source . iraq text approved at highest level in his final speech , jonathan sumption , the lawyer representing the government , defended the " rigorous " way the iraq dossier was prepared and added that the 45 minute claim was at the " conservative end of the scale " indicated by intelligence . sumption told the inquiry that every suggestion for the dossier made by alistair campbell and downing street official jonathan powell had been " scrupulously considered " by joint intelligence committee chairman john scarlett and assessment officials against the intelligence .
he added that there was no way that such an important document , one that would have been presented and defended in parliament by the prime minister himself , would not have been personally approved by tony blair . sumption also went on to deny that government had ever been engaged in any " crusade " against the bbc .
the government 's reaction was not due to any clash of personalities , but because the prime minister and his top staff all knew gilligan 's story was a " travesty " . media lawyers to deliver closings the bbc lawyers , representatives of andrew gilligan and the hutton inquiry barristers themselves will make their closing statements towards the end of the final hearing .

germany may be experiencing a new round of cuddly nostalgia about everyday life in east germany , but memories of its darker side have resurfaced following the arrest of a suspected member of the regime ’ s assassin squad . east germany may have imploded in 1989 when the berlin wall fell , but the failed communist state has been making a comeback – at least in the minds of some germans – following a recent wave of german television revival shows . ostalgie , a play on words meaning nostalgia of the east , has gripped many easterners as they look back fondly at the everyday life during their salad days before the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- was swallowed by the capitalist west germany in 1990 . but just as some critics have warned ostalgie often glosses over the gdr ’ s nastier side , a prime example of how ruthless the totalitarian regime was surfaced this week : german federal prosecutors announced that they had arrested a suspected east german contract killer on monday . identified only as jürgen g. , as is the custom in germany not to give the last name , the 53 year-old is thought to have worked as a hit man from 1976 to 1987 while part of a gdr commando unit .
“ the suspect is believed to have killed a number of people that were considered by the gdr regime to have committed treason or likely to , ” prosecutors said . it is the first time anyone has been arrested for suspicion of working as an assassin for the east german state .

germany may be experiencing a new round of cuddly nostalgia about everyday life in east germany , but memories of its darker side have resurfaced following the arrest of a suspected member of the regime ’ s assassin squad . east germany may have imploded in 1989 when the berlin wall fell , but the failed communist state has been making a comeback – at least in the minds of some germans – following a recent wave of german television revival shows . ostalgie , a play on words meaning nostalgia of the east , has gripped many easterners as they look back fondly at the everyday life during their salad days before the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- was swallowed by the capitalist west germany in 1990 . but just as some critics have warned ostalgie often glosses over the gdr ’ s nastier side , a prime example of how ruthless the totalitarian regime was surfaced this week : german federal prosecutors announced that they had arrested a suspected east german contract killer on monday . identified only as jürgen g. , as is the custom in germany not to give the last name , the 53 year-old is thought to have worked as a hit man from 1976 to 1987 while part of a gdr commando unit .
“ the suspect is believed to have killed a number of people that were considered by the gdr regime to have committed treason or likely to , ” prosecutors said . it is the first time anyone has been arrested for suspicion of working as an assassin for the east german state .
the highly feared east german secret police , or stasi , has long been suspected of having a death squad , even though top communist officials denied its existence after the wall fell . “ liquidating ” traitors stasi expert hubertus knabe believes the organization may have had hundreds of operatives for “ liquidating ” traitors .
“ besides sabotage they were also supposed to murder , ” he told the german news agency dpa . although there have been several mysterious deaths beyond east germany ’ s borders that have been linked to the stasi , there has never been hard evidence to prove the existence of the killer commandos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz eigendorf died under mysterious circumstances in 1983 .
lutz eigendorf , an eastern soccer player who defected to west germany in 1979 , died in an apparent car crash in 1983 in the western town of braunschweig . although alcohol was found in his bloodstream , the level was considered far too high for eigendorf to have drank in less than two hours . having once played for the stasi-favored bfc dynamo in berlin , it is rumored stasi boss erich mielke personally ordered his murder . and according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , a three-man killer squad from the stasi was also involved in the 1984 death of swedish television journalist cats falk , who was investigating illegal high-tech shipments between the gdr and swedish arms firms .

dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .
the bulk of the savings will come by scaling back on special benefits and coverage for expensive dental work .
key points of reform : dentures : after 2005 replacement teeth will no longer be covered under the statutory health insurance plan .
patients must pay for dentures out of their own pocket or insure them with an extra income-based dental policy .
families are automatically insured through the main policy holder .
individuals in the public insurance plan can also opt to sign a dental policy with private insurers .
families are not covered in the private plans .
sick pay : starting in 2006 employers will be required to pay all wages for workers after the seventh week of sick leave without receiving subsidies from the insurance companies .
the individual worker will be required to pay a supplementary premium of 0.5 percent .
sick pay up to the sixth week of illness is completely covered by health insurance .
additional fees : in general patients will be required to make a copayment of € 5 or , at the most , € 10 on all care they receive .
the additional fees are not to surpass € 10 euros per quarter for individual medical and dental treatment and is not required for treatment based on referrals .
hospital care will also cost € 10 a day for a maximum of 28 days per year .
out-patient care and house visits carry an additional price tag of € 10 plus 10 percent of the overall medical bill .
none of the supplementary fees may exceed the ceiling of 2 percent of income or 1 percent for chronically ill patients .
reductions : health insurerance will no longer pay for taxi rides to out-patient treatment .
sterilization for non-medical related reasons has been cut entirely from the budget and coverage for fertilization will be limited .
subsidies for glasses and other sight aids will only be covered for patients under 18 years and for the severely handicapped .
the previously paid birth and death supplements -lrb- although not the medical costs related to having a child -rrb- will be cut in the future .
and patients will have to pay for a broad series of prescription-free medicine instead of relying on subsidies from their insurer .
patients : patients who can prove they have taken advantage of preventive care may receive a financial bonus from insurers .
out-patient treatment within the eu will be covered , but for a hospital stay approval from the insurer is required .
doctors : they will be required to show proof of continuing education otherwise they will suffer disadvantages in reimbursement from the insurers .
insurers must cover doctors ’ house visits and hospitals may offer out-patient treatment in a patient ’ s home .
pharmaceutical industry : pharmacies are required to offer medication at the cheapest price available , even for re-imports .
mail order pharmacies are permitted under the new law .
pharmacists may now own up to three branches and there is no longer a fixed price on medication .
contributions : the current fee requiring a contribution of 14.3 percent of income for employees will be reduced next year to 13.6 and in 2006 to 12.15 percent .
the current practice of splitting the costs equally between employer and employee will continue .
insurers : the reforms are expected to save the insurers up to € 9 billion .
from that amount they will be able to chop off € 3 billion in debts and pay for the reduced contributions .

dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .
the bulk of the savings will come by scaling back on special benefits and coverage for expensive dental work .

the previously paid birth and death supplements -lrb- although not the medical costs related to having a child -rrb- will be cut in the future .
and patients will have to pay for a broad series of prescription-free medicine instead of relying on subsidies from their insurer .
patients : patients who can prove they have taken advantage of preventive care may receive a financial bonus from insurers .
out-patient treatment within the eu will be covered , but for a hospital stay approval from the insurer is required .
doctors : they will be required to show proof of continuing education otherwise they will suffer disadvantages in reimbursement from the insurers .

in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder returned home on thursday from the un meeting on the future of iraq with germany 's diplomatic star in the ascendant again , after months of strife with the united states over iraq . the chancellor 's plane had hardly finished taxiing into a berlin airport before a tired-looking schröder was on his way to the german parliament to report the good news . the month-long diplomatic rift between the u.s. and germany over iraq was , in the words of u.s. president george w. bush , " over , " and the international community was on its way to taking decisive steps to secure future stability in postwar iraq . a free democratic future addressing the german parliament , schröder drew a line in the sand over the arguments over war in iraq which had soured u.s.-german relations and focused solely on the future in the persian gulf region . " independent of whether countries were for or against the war -lrb- on iraq -rrb- , it is now paramount that the international community ensures the new iraq is free , democratic and stable , " he told german parliamentarians . germany is in agreement with france and the united states that a new iraqi constitution must be drawn up as soon as possible and free elections , under the auspices of the un , should take place , although no timescale for that has been set as yet . no german military involvement but although schröder said germany was ready to provide humanitarian , technical and economic aid for the reconstruction efforts and train up iraqi security personnel , he rejected sending german troops to the region and said he did not support plans to beef up the numbers of foreign troops already there to increase security .

in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder returned home on thursday from the un meeting on the future of iraq with germany 's diplomatic star in the ascendant again , after months of strife with the united states over iraq . the chancellor 's plane had hardly finished taxiing into a berlin airport before a tired-looking schröder was on his way to the german parliament to report the good news . the month-long diplomatic rift between the u.s. and germany over iraq was , in the words of u.s. president george w. bush , " over , " and the international community was on its way to taking decisive steps to secure future stability in postwar iraq . a free democratic future addressing the german parliament , schröder drew a line in the sand over the arguments over war in iraq which had soured u.s.-german relations and focused solely on the future in the persian gulf region . " independent of whether countries were for or against the war -lrb- on iraq -rrb- , it is now paramount that the international community ensures the new iraq is free , democratic and stable , " he told german parliamentarians . germany is in agreement with france and the united states that a new iraqi constitution must be drawn up as soon as possible and free elections , under the auspices of the un , should take place , although no timescale for that has been set as yet . no german military involvement but although schröder said germany was ready to provide humanitarian , technical and economic aid for the reconstruction efforts and train up iraqi security personnel , he rejected sending german troops to the region and said he did not support plans to beef up the numbers of foreign troops already there to increase security . " my personal view is that , in this current phase , it 's not about increasing the numbers of foreign troops in the region , rather that security can be ensured by training iraqi security personnel , " schröder said .
" iraqis have the ability to communicate with their own people and have the necessary understanding of the iraqi mentality and culture to be able to ensure long term security in the region -lrb- better than foreign troops -rrb- . " tough times ahead meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer - who cut short his trip to the states to return to german for friday 's first crucial first vote on the german government 's agenda 2010 reform package - warned that the toughest times for iraq have yet to come . " the reality today is this : if reconstruction in iraq goes wrong ; if irresponsible or terrorist powers flourish , then we will have an awful price to pay , regardless of whether we were for or against the war , " fischer said .
" however , it makes no sense to pursue a strategy that only makes the problems bigger , rather than reducing them . " fischer called for the un to play greater role in postwar iraq , although cautioned it was not realistic for u.s. and allied troops to pull out of the region immediately .
that would be , he said , a move which would lead to the " opening of a vacuum " and could be exploited .
singing from schröder 's hymn sheet , he said the discussion on the sidelines of tuesday 's un meeting in new york had brought all involved closer along the road to making difficult decisions . " whether the presence of occupying forces is really perceived as a liberating force in the reconstruction of a democratic state , is a decisive political question , " he said .
" we should do everything in our power to ensure that the second part of this is prioritized .
this is going to be difficult and a long term effort : we have already experienced it in afghanistan , but these basic decisions are of central importance . " permanent security council seat fischer added that he believed now that germany 's role in the un had now grown it would now only be a matter of time before the country gains a permanent seat on the un security council . " -lrb- we should -rrb- do our part as well as we can , shoulder our responsibility for the international community and i think it -lrb- a permanent seat on the security council -rrb- will come as a matter of course , he said , but cautioned .

the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .
the health reform bill is only the first of 11 pieces of legislation to be brought into parliament this autumn as part of schröder 's agenda 2010 reform platform .
in the past schröder has threatened to resign if his party refused to follow him in parliament .
the chancellor is said to have avoided this tactic on thursday , but reports said he warned members of parliament of the consequences of a loss of momentum in the reform process .
speaking to reporters after the vote , schröder ’ s spokesman bela anda said , " the chancellor does not threaten to resign .
but he emphasized the importance of the agenda 2010 measures being passed with an own -lrb- meaning spd-greens -rrb- majority . "
" it is important not only for the health care reform vote today but also for further votes down the road on agenda 2010 reforms , " he said .
the bill still requires approval from germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , but that body is expected to pass the law as soon as mid-october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system .

the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .
the health reform bill is only the first of 11 pieces of legislation to be brought into parliament this autumn as part of schröder 's agenda 2010 reform platform .
in the past schröder has threatened to resign if his party refused to follow him in parliament .
the chancellor is said to have avoided this tactic on thursday , but reports said he warned members of parliament of the consequences of a loss of momentum in the reform process .
speaking to reporters after the vote , schröder ’ s spokesman bela anda said , " the chancellor does not threaten to resign .
but he emphasized the importance of the agenda 2010 measures being passed with an own -lrb- meaning spd-greens -rrb- majority . "
" it is important not only for the health care reform vote today but also for further votes down the road on agenda 2010 reforms , " he said .
the bill still requires approval from germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , but that body is expected to pass the law as soon as mid-october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system .

in the past schröder has threatened to resign if his party refused to follow him in parliament .
the chancellor is said to have avoided this tactic on thursday , but reports said he warned members of parliament of the consequences of a loss of momentum in the reform process .

but he emphasized the importance of the agenda 2010 measures being passed with an own -lrb- meaning spd-greens -rrb- majority . "
" it is important not only for the health care reform vote today but also for further votes down the road on agenda 2010 reforms , " he said .

the company , which is often called the ikea of the fashion world for its smart designs and low prices , seems unperturbed by the fact that the state of the german economy has made a negative impression in its third quarter figures and has announced that the majority of the 51 new stores it plans to open in the fourth quarter of the year will be in germany .
h & m announced its plan to expand further at a time when the global economic slowdown has forced many other retailers into retreat .
in the first nine months of its fiscal year , the company opened 63 new stores and closed six in the first , giving it a total of 901 .
the new stores planned for the end of the year , which will also include an added push into the united states clothing market , will easily offset the closure of five others which will cease trading before the company issues its full year results .

the italian store brings the company ’ s european reach to 16 countries , including stores in eastern europe located in the czech republic and poland .
to enlarge its reach in germany at this time is seen by many analysts as a brave move by h & m despite the huge popularity of the chain among germans .

" sales in the third quarter have been weak , mainly due to the unusually warm weather in central europe .
sales in august have been characterized by large fluctuations , " h & m ceo rolf eriksen said at the company 's press conference on thursday .
the reported figures showed that sales fell in the first nine months of h & m ’ s fiscal year and that turnover grew a mere five percent in august , falling short of analysts expectations .
the company reported a june-august pre-tax profit of 2.08 billion crowns -lrb- € 200 million -rrb- , up 9 percent year-on-year compared to forecasts of 2.15 billion crowns .

in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder returned home on thursday from the un meeting on the future of iraq with germany 's diplomatic star in the ascendant again , after months of strife with the united states over iraq . the chancellor 's plane had hardly finished taxiing into a berlin airport before a tired-looking schröder was on his way to the german parliament to report the good news . the month-long diplomatic rift between the u.s. and germany over iraq was , in the words of u.s. president george w. bush , " over , " and the international community was on its way to taking decisive steps to secure future stability in postwar iraq . a free democratic future addressing the german parliament , schröder drew a line in the sand over the arguments over war in iraq which had soured u.s.-german relations and focused solely on the future in the persian gulf region . " independent of whether countries were for or against the war -lrb- on iraq -rrb- , it is now paramount that the international community ensures the new iraq is free , democratic and stable , " he told german parliamentarians . germany is in agreement with france and the united states that a new iraqi constitution must be drawn up as soon as possible and free elections , under the auspices of the un , should take place , although no timescale for that has been set as yet . no german military involvement but although schröder said germany was ready to provide humanitarian , technical and economic aid for the reconstruction efforts and train up iraqi security personnel , he rejected sending german troops to the region and said he did not support plans to beef up the numbers of foreign troops already there to increase security .

the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .

economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .

the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's path to reform a quick guide to ‘ agenda 2010 ’ revamping germany ’ s pension system labor market reforms spelled out german government accelerates tax cuts to boost economy germany -pipe- 26.09.2003 a look inside germany 's healthcare reforms in the first of several larger reforms , german parliament has passed a major healthcare package calling for patients to shoulder more of the country ’ s growing medical costs .
dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .
the bulk of the savings will come by scaling back on special benefits and coverage for expensive dental work .
key points of reform : dentures : after 2005 replacement teeth will no longer be covered under the statutory health insurance plan .
patients must pay for dentures out of their own pocket or insure them with an extra income-based dental policy .
families are automatically insured through the main policy holder .
individuals in the public insurance plan can also opt to sign a dental policy with private insurers .
families are not covered in the private plans .
sick pay : starting in 2006 employers will be required to pay all wages for workers after the seventh week of sick leave without receiving subsidies from the insurance companies .
the individual worker will be required to pay a supplementary premium of 0.5 percent .
sick pay up to the sixth week of illness is completely covered by health insurance .

dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .
the bulk of the savings will come by scaling back on special benefits and coverage for expensive dental work .
key points of reform : dentures : after 2005 replacement teeth will no longer be covered under the statutory health insurance plan .
patients must pay for dentures out of their own pocket or insure them with an extra income-based dental policy .
families are automatically insured through the main policy holder .
individuals in the public insurance plan can also opt to sign a dental policy with private insurers .
families are not covered in the private plans .
sick pay : starting in 2006 employers will be required to pay all wages for workers after the seventh week of sick leave without receiving subsidies from the insurance companies .
the individual worker will be required to pay a supplementary premium of 0.5 percent .
sick pay up to the sixth week of illness is completely covered by health insurance .
additional fees : in general patients will be required to make a copayment of € 5 or , at the most , € 10 on all care they receive .

the company , which is often called the ikea of the fashion world for its smart designs and low prices , seems unperturbed by the fact that the state of the german economy has made a negative impression in its third quarter figures and has announced that the majority of the 51 new stores it plans to open in the fourth quarter of the year will be in germany .
h & m announced its plan to expand further at a time when the global economic slowdown has forced many other retailers into retreat .
in the first nine months of its fiscal year , the company opened 63 new stores and closed six in the first , giving it a total of 901 .
the new stores planned for the end of the year , which will also include an added push into the united states clothing market , will easily offset the closure of five others which will cease trading before the company issues its full year results .
italian flagship store opens the company , one of the world 's biggest high-street clothing stores by market value , added in its statement that it intended to continue its expansion plans at the same rate well into the next year .
h & m opened its first italian store in central milan in september with a view to opening additional stores during 2004 .
the italian store brings the company ’ s european reach to 16 countries , including stores in eastern europe located in the czech republic and poland .
to enlarge its reach in germany at this time is seen by many analysts as a brave move by h & m despite the huge popularity of the chain among germans .
sales in germany bring in nearly a third of the company ’ s turnover but the current recession and rate of unemployment in the country has made the usually enthusiastic german shoppers more cautious .
good and bad weather to blame bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rolf eriksen , ceo of hennes & mauritz .
h & m ’ s results for the third quarter reflect consumer concern in germany to a certain extent but the firm was quick to blame the majority of the slowdown in sales on the unusually cold weather at the start of the year and then the exceptionally hot weather across europe for the slower sales .
" sales in the third quarter have been weak , mainly due to the unusually warm weather in central europe .
sales in august have been characterized by large fluctuations , " h & m ceo rolf eriksen said at the company 's press conference on thursday .
the reported figures showed that sales fell in the first nine months of h & m ’ s fiscal year and that turnover grew a mere five percent in august , falling short of analysts expectations .
the company reported a june-august pre-tax profit of 2.08 billion crowns -lrb- € 200 million -rrb- , up 9 percent year-on-year compared to forecasts of 2.15 billion crowns .
however , sales for the third quarter were up 4 percent year-on-year to 13.21 billion crowns , slightly above a consensus of 11.54 billion .
shares inch up regardless a third-quarter gross profit margin of 55.6 percent beat expectations , up from 54.0 percent a year before , and a 17.7 percent operating margin was the best ever for that period .
the news helped h & m shares gain slightly as analysts pointed out that company ’ s profitability remained strong .
" they seem to have good control of the gross margin and of costs .
the big question is whether the sales decline is temporary , " said one analyst . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de longer shopping hours a boon for german stores germany ’ s recently liberalized store opening law allows shops to remain open until 8 p.m.

the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .
the health reform bill is only the first of 11 pieces of legislation to be brought into parliament this autumn as part of schröder 's agenda 2010 reform platform .
in the past schröder has threatened to resign if his party refused to follow him in parliament .
the chancellor is said to have avoided this tactic on thursday , but reports said he warned members of parliament of the consequences of a loss of momentum in the reform process .
speaking to reporters after the vote , schröder ’ s spokesman bela anda said , " the chancellor does not threaten to resign .
but he emphasized the importance of the agenda 2010 measures being passed with an own -lrb- meaning spd-greens -rrb- majority . "
" it is important not only for the health care reform vote today but also for further votes down the road on agenda 2010 reforms , " he said .

jeremy gompertz q.c. representing dr. kelly ’ s relatives told the inquiry that the scientist ’ s family wanted to expose the government 's " duplicity " in the way it treated the scientist before his apparent suicide , adding that kelly had been used as “ a pawn ” in the government ’ s political battle with the bbc .
however , gompertz maintained that the weapons expert ’ s family were not looking for " revenge or retribution " on any " scapegoats " but wanted to help identify and correct " systemic failures " at the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- , dr. kelly ’ s employers . " never again should someone be put in such a position , " said gompertz , who accused both the government and the media for the " total lack of care " kelly received amid the frenzy surrounding his outing as the source for the bbc report that questioned an integral statement in the government ’ s iraq dossier . bbc man used kelly as source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan .
the bbc ’ s andrew gilligan reported in may on the radio program today , and then subsequently in the national newspaper the mail on sunday , that the claim that saddam hussein could have chemical and biological weapons ready in 45 minutes was included in the government 's dossier despite the fact officials knew it to be false .
it was later revealed that dr. kelly was the person who passed on these doubts to the journalist . it is claimed that the imminent exposure from being named and pressure from the government finally led to kelly taking his own life .
gompertz said no credence should be given to gilligan 's account of his talks with kelly , except where it could be corroborated by independent sources . caught in the crossfire the reporting of the 45 minute claim put the bbc and the government on a collision course , and kelly ’ s lawyer pointed out in his closing address that the scientist was caught in the middle .
gompertz attacked the " hypocrisy " of the british government for denying there was a strategy to use kelly in the dossier row with the bbc .
" this was a cynical abuse of power which deserves the strongest possible condemnation . " he concluded : " no wonder dr kelly felt betrayed after giving his life in service to the country ... in his despair , he seems to have taken his own life . " government cleared twice of wrong-doing both the hutton inquiry and the previous investigation by the foreign affairs committee have cleared the british government of deliberately inserting information known to be false but both have reprimanded the government for issuing misleading information and for not clarifying important data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
defense minister geoff hoon has been singled out for condemnation for his role in maintaining the ambiguity surrounding the 45 minute claim despite concerns raised by staff at the mod and for authorizing the press statement which led to dr kelly being named as the suspected source . iraq text approved at highest level in his final speech , jonathan sumption , the lawyer representing the government , defended the " rigorous " way the iraq dossier was prepared and added that the 45 minute claim was at the " conservative end of the scale " indicated by intelligence . sumption told the inquiry that every suggestion for the dossier made by alistair campbell and downing street official jonathan powell had been " scrupulously considered " by joint intelligence committee chairman john scarlett and assessment officials against the intelligence .
he added that there was no way that such an important document , one that would have been presented and defended in parliament by the prime minister himself , would not have been personally approved by tony blair . sumption also went on to deny that government had ever been engaged in any " crusade " against the bbc .
the government 's reaction was not due to any clash of personalities , but because the prime minister and his top staff all knew gilligan 's story was a " travesty " . media lawyers to deliver closings the bbc lawyers , representatives of andrew gilligan and the hutton inquiry barristers themselves will make their closing statements towards the end of the final hearing .

germany may be experiencing a new round of cuddly nostalgia about everyday life in east germany , but memories of its darker side have resurfaced following the arrest of a suspected member of the regime ’ s assassin squad . east germany may have imploded in 1989 when the berlin wall fell , but the failed communist state has been making a comeback – at least in the minds of some germans – following a recent wave of german television revival shows . ostalgie , a play on words meaning nostalgia of the east , has gripped many easterners as they look back fondly at the everyday life during their salad days before the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- was swallowed by the capitalist west germany in 1990 . but just as some critics have warned ostalgie often glosses over the gdr ’ s nastier side , a prime example of how ruthless the totalitarian regime was surfaced this week : german federal prosecutors announced that they had arrested a suspected east german contract killer on monday . identified only as jürgen g. , as is the custom in germany not to give the last name , the 53 year-old is thought to have worked as a hit man from 1976 to 1987 while part of a gdr commando unit .
“ the suspect is believed to have killed a number of people that were considered by the gdr regime to have committed treason or likely to , ” prosecutors said . it is the first time anyone has been arrested for suspicion of working as an assassin for the east german state .

germany may be experiencing a new round of cuddly nostalgia about everyday life in east germany , but memories of its darker side have resurfaced following the arrest of a suspected member of the regime ’ s assassin squad . east germany may have imploded in 1989 when the berlin wall fell , but the failed communist state has been making a comeback – at least in the minds of some germans – following a recent wave of german television revival shows . ostalgie , a play on words meaning nostalgia of the east , has gripped many easterners as they look back fondly at the everyday life during their salad days before the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- was swallowed by the capitalist west germany in 1990 . but just as some critics have warned ostalgie often glosses over the gdr ’ s nastier side , a prime example of how ruthless the totalitarian regime was surfaced this week : german federal prosecutors announced that they had arrested a suspected east german contract killer on monday . identified only as jürgen g. , as is the custom in germany not to give the last name , the 53 year-old is thought to have worked as a hit man from 1976 to 1987 while part of a gdr commando unit .
“ the suspect is believed to have killed a number of people that were considered by the gdr regime to have committed treason or likely to , ” prosecutors said . it is the first time anyone has been arrested for suspicion of working as an assassin for the east german state .
the highly feared east german secret police , or stasi , has long been suspected of having a death squad , even though top communist officials denied its existence after the wall fell . “ liquidating ” traitors stasi expert hubertus knabe believes the organization may have had hundreds of operatives for “ liquidating ” traitors .
“ besides sabotage they were also supposed to murder , ” he told the german news agency dpa . although there have been several mysterious deaths beyond east germany ’ s borders that have been linked to the stasi , there has never been hard evidence to prove the existence of the killer commandos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz eigendorf died under mysterious circumstances in 1983 .
lutz eigendorf , an eastern soccer player who defected to west germany in 1979 , died in an apparent car crash in 1983 in the western town of braunschweig . although alcohol was found in his bloodstream , the level was considered far too high for eigendorf to have drank in less than two hours . having once played for the stasi-favored bfc dynamo in berlin , it is rumored stasi boss erich mielke personally ordered his murder . and according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , a three-man killer squad from the stasi was also involved in the 1984 death of swedish television journalist cats falk , who was investigating illegal high-tech shipments between the gdr and swedish arms firms .

the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .
the health reform bill is only the first of 11 pieces of legislation to be brought into parliament this autumn as part of schröder 's agenda 2010 reform platform .
in the past schröder has threatened to resign if his party refused to follow him in parliament .
the chancellor is said to have avoided this tactic on thursday , but reports said he warned members of parliament of the consequences of a loss of momentum in the reform process .
speaking to reporters after the vote , schröder ’ s spokesman bela anda said , " the chancellor does not threaten to resign .
but he emphasized the importance of the agenda 2010 measures being passed with an own -lrb- meaning spd-greens -rrb- majority . "
" it is important not only for the health care reform vote today but also for further votes down the road on agenda 2010 reforms , " he said .
the bill still requires approval from germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , but that body is expected to pass the law as soon as mid-october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system .

gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .
the health reform bill is only the first of 11 pieces of legislation to be brought into parliament this autumn as part of schröder 's agenda 2010 reform platform .
in the past schröder has threatened to resign if his party refused to follow him in parliament .
the chancellor is said to have avoided this tactic on thursday , but reports said he warned members of parliament of the consequences of a loss of momentum in the reform process .
speaking to reporters after the vote , schröder ’ s spokesman bela anda said , " the chancellor does not threaten to resign .
but he emphasized the importance of the agenda 2010 measures being passed with an own -lrb- meaning spd-greens -rrb- majority . "
" it is important not only for the health care reform vote today but also for further votes down the road on agenda 2010 reforms , " he said .
the bill still requires approval from germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , but that body is expected to pass the law as soon as mid-october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system .

in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder returned home on thursday from the un meeting on the future of iraq with germany 's diplomatic star in the ascendant again , after months of strife with the united states over iraq . the chancellor 's plane had hardly finished taxiing into a berlin airport before a tired-looking schröder was on his way to the german parliament to report the good news . the month-long diplomatic rift between the u.s. and germany over iraq was , in the words of u.s. president george w. bush , " over , " and the international community was on its way to taking decisive steps to secure future stability in postwar iraq . a free democratic future addressing the german parliament , schröder drew a line in the sand over the arguments over war in iraq which had soured u.s.-german relations and focused solely on the future in the persian gulf region . " independent of whether countries were for or against the war -lrb- on iraq -rrb- , it is now paramount that the international community ensures the new iraq is free , democratic and stable , " he told german parliamentarians . germany is in agreement with france and the united states that a new iraqi constitution must be drawn up as soon as possible and free elections , under the auspices of the un , should take place , although no timescale for that has been set as yet . no german military involvement but although schröder said germany was ready to provide humanitarian , technical and economic aid for the reconstruction efforts and train up iraqi security personnel , he rejected sending german troops to the region and said he did not support plans to beef up the numbers of foreign troops already there to increase security . " my personal view is that , in this current phase , it 's not about increasing the numbers of foreign troops in the region , rather that security can be ensured by training iraqi security personnel , " schröder said .
" iraqis have the ability to communicate with their own people and have the necessary understanding of the iraqi mentality and culture to be able to ensure long term security in the region -lrb- better than foreign troops -rrb- .

" the reality today is this : if reconstruction in iraq goes wrong ; if irresponsible or terrorist powers flourish , then we will have an awful price to pay , regardless of whether we were for or against the war , " fischer said .
" however , it makes no sense to pursue a strategy that only makes the problems bigger , rather than reducing them . " fischer called for the un to play greater role in postwar iraq , although cautioned it was not realistic for u.s. and allied troops to pull out of the region immediately .
that would be , he said , a move which would lead to the " opening of a vacuum " and could be exploited .
singing from schröder 's hymn sheet , he said the discussion on the sidelines of tuesday 's un meeting in new york had brought all involved closer along the road to making difficult decisions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.09.2003 schröder : let 's build a free , democratic and stable iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder , with his foreign minister at the u.n. , told parliament his trip was successful .
in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder returned home on thursday from the un meeting on the future of iraq with germany 's diplomatic star in the ascendant again , after months of strife with the united states over iraq . the chancellor 's plane had hardly finished taxiing into a berlin airport before a tired-looking schröder was on his way to the german parliament to report the good news . the month-long diplomatic rift between the u.s. and germany over iraq was , in the words of u.s. president george w. bush , " over , " and the international community was on its way to taking decisive steps to secure future stability in postwar iraq . a free democratic future addressing the german parliament , schröder drew a line in the sand over the arguments over war in iraq which had soured u.s.-german relations and focused solely on the future in the persian gulf region . " independent of whether countries were for or against the war -lrb- on iraq -rrb- , it is now paramount that the international community ensures the new iraq is free , democratic and stable , " he told german parliamentarians . germany is in agreement with france and the united states that a new iraqi constitution must be drawn up as soon as possible and free elections , under the auspices of the un , should take place , although no timescale for that has been set as yet . no german military involvement but although schröder said germany was ready to provide humanitarian , technical and economic aid for the reconstruction efforts and train up iraqi security personnel , he rejected sending german troops to the region and said he did not support plans to beef up the numbers of foreign troops already there to increase security . " my personal view is that , in this current phase , it 's not about increasing the numbers of foreign troops in the region , rather that security can be ensured by training iraqi security personnel , " schröder said .
" iraqis have the ability to communicate with their own people and have the necessary understanding of the iraqi mentality and culture to be able to ensure long term security in the region -lrb- better than foreign troops -rrb- . " tough times ahead meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer - who cut short his trip to the states to return to german for friday 's first crucial first vote on the german government 's agenda 2010 reform package - warned that the toughest times for iraq have yet to come . " the reality today is this : if reconstruction in iraq goes wrong ; if irresponsible or terrorist powers flourish , then we will have an awful price to pay , regardless of whether we were for or against the war , " fischer said .
" however , it makes no sense to pursue a strategy that only makes the problems bigger , rather than reducing them . " fischer called for the un to play greater role in postwar iraq , although cautioned it was not realistic for u.s. and allied troops to pull out of the region immediately .
that would be , he said , a move which would lead to the " opening of a vacuum " and could be exploited .
singing from schröder 's hymn sheet , he said the discussion on the sidelines of tuesday 's un meeting in new york had brought all involved closer along the road to making difficult decisions . " whether the presence of occupying forces is really perceived as a liberating force in the reconstruction of a democratic state , is a decisive political question , " he said .

dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .

and patients will have to pay for a broad series of prescription-free medicine instead of relying on subsidies from their insurer .
patients : patients who can prove they have taken advantage of preventive care may receive a financial bonus from insurers .

dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .
the bulk of the savings will come by scaling back on special benefits and coverage for expensive dental work .
key points of reform : dentures : after 2005 replacement teeth will no longer be covered under the statutory health insurance plan .
patients must pay for dentures out of their own pocket or insure them with an extra income-based dental policy .
families are automatically insured through the main policy holder .
individuals in the public insurance plan can also opt to sign a dental policy with private insurers .
families are not covered in the private plans .

the additional fees are not to surpass € 10 euros per quarter for individual medical and dental treatment and is not required for treatment based on referrals .
hospital care will also cost € 10 a day for a maximum of 28 days per year .
out-patient care and house visits carry an additional price tag of € 10 plus 10 percent of the overall medical bill .
none of the supplementary fees may exceed the ceiling of 2 percent of income or 1 percent for chronically ill patients .
reductions : health insurerance will no longer pay for taxi rides to out-patient treatment .
sterilization for non-medical related reasons has been cut entirely from the budget and coverage for fertilization will be limited .
subsidies for glasses and other sight aids will only be covered for patients under 18 years and for the severely handicapped .
the previously paid birth and death supplements -lrb- although not the medical costs related to having a child -rrb- will be cut in the future .
and patients will have to pay for a broad series of prescription-free medicine instead of relying on subsidies from their insurer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.09.2003 parliament approves massive healthcare reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in germany 's bundestag passed the first of gerhard schröder 's political reform bills in a difficult vote .
the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .
the health reform bill is only the first of 11 pieces of legislation to be brought into parliament this autumn as part of schröder 's agenda 2010 reform platform .
in the past schröder has threatened to resign if his party refused to follow him in parliament .
the chancellor is said to have avoided this tactic on thursday , but reports said he warned members of parliament of the consequences of a loss of momentum in the reform process .
speaking to reporters after the vote , schröder ’ s spokesman bela anda said , " the chancellor does not threaten to resign .
but he emphasized the importance of the agenda 2010 measures being passed with an own -lrb- meaning spd-greens -rrb- majority . "
" it is important not only for the health care reform vote today but also for further votes down the road on agenda 2010 reforms , " he said .
the bill still requires approval from germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , but that body is expected to pass the law as soon as mid-october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system .

in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder returned home on thursday from the un meeting on the future of iraq with germany 's diplomatic star in the ascendant again , after months of strife with the united states over iraq . the chancellor 's plane had hardly finished taxiing into a berlin airport before a tired-looking schröder was on his way to the german parliament to report the good news . the month-long diplomatic rift between the u.s. and germany over iraq was , in the words of u.s. president george w. bush , " over , " and the international community was on its way to taking decisive steps to secure future stability in postwar iraq . a free democratic future addressing the german parliament , schröder drew a line in the sand over the arguments over war in iraq which had soured u.s.-german relations and focused solely on the future in the persian gulf region . " independent of whether countries were for or against the war -lrb- on iraq -rrb- , it is now paramount that the international community ensures the new iraq is free , democratic and stable , " he told german parliamentarians . germany is in agreement with france and the united states that a new iraqi constitution must be drawn up as soon as possible and free elections , under the auspices of the un , should take place , although no timescale for that has been set as yet . no german military involvement but although schröder said germany was ready to provide humanitarian , technical and economic aid for the reconstruction efforts and train up iraqi security personnel , he rejected sending german troops to the region and said he did not support plans to beef up the numbers of foreign troops already there to increase security . " my personal view is that , in this current phase , it 's not about increasing the numbers of foreign troops in the region , rather that security can be ensured by training iraqi security personnel , " schröder said .
" iraqis have the ability to communicate with their own people and have the necessary understanding of the iraqi mentality and culture to be able to ensure long term security in the region -lrb- better than foreign troops -rrb- . " tough times ahead meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer - who cut short his trip to the states to return to german for friday 's first crucial first vote on the german government 's agenda 2010 reform package - warned that the toughest times for iraq have yet to come . " the reality today is this : if reconstruction in iraq goes wrong ; if irresponsible or terrorist powers flourish , then we will have an awful price to pay , regardless of whether we were for or against the war , " fischer said .
" however , it makes no sense to pursue a strategy that only makes the problems bigger , rather than reducing them . " fischer called for the un to play greater role in postwar iraq , although cautioned it was not realistic for u.s. and allied troops to pull out of the region immediately .
that would be , he said , a move which would lead to the " opening of a vacuum " and could be exploited .
singing from schröder 's hymn sheet , he said the discussion on the sidelines of tuesday 's un meeting in new york had brought all involved closer along the road to making difficult decisions . " whether the presence of occupying forces is really perceived as a liberating force in the reconstruction of a democratic state , is a decisive political question , " he said .
" we should do everything in our power to ensure that the second part of this is prioritized .
this is going to be difficult and a long term effort : we have already experienced it in afghanistan , but these basic decisions are of central importance . " permanent security council seat fischer added that he believed now that germany 's role in the un had now grown it would now only be a matter of time before the country gains a permanent seat on the un security council . " -lrb- we should -rrb- do our part as well as we can , shoulder our responsibility for the international community and i think it -lrb- a permanent seat on the security council -rrb- will come as a matter of course , he said , but cautioned .
" we should n't pursue it as a policy of national prestige or rush ahead with it - that 's my advice . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reacts cautiously to iraq resolution in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 26.09.2003 hutton inquiry hears closing statements großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lord hutton will present his conclusion in a report by the end of the year one of the most public and controversial inquiries into the workings of the british government and its level of involvement in the apparent suicide of scientist david kelly ended on thursday . the hutton inquiry heard the final testimonies on thursday of those involved in the case surrounding the alleged connection between the british government ’ s iraq dossier , the claims of political manipulation made by the bbc and the apparent suicide of ministry of defence weapons expert dr david kelly . since the inquiry began on august 1 , in the wake of kelly ’ s death in july , personalities from the media , politics and members of dr. kelly ’ s family have given evidence and spoken about their involvement in events that have cast a considerable shadow over the credibility of tony blair ’ s labour government . on the final day before the inquiry adjourns to compile its findings and reach its decision , lawyers representing the kelly family , the government and the bbc made their closing statements . government used kelly as " a pawn " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons advisor .
jeremy gompertz q.c. representing dr. kelly ’ s relatives told the inquiry that the scientist ’ s family wanted to expose the government 's " duplicity " in the way it treated the scientist before his apparent suicide , adding that kelly had been used as “ a pawn ” in the government ’ s political battle with the bbc .
however , gompertz maintained that the weapons expert ’ s family were not looking for " revenge or retribution " on any " scapegoats " but wanted to help identify and correct " systemic failures " at the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- , dr. kelly ’ s employers . " never again should someone be put in such a position , " said gompertz , who accused both the government and the media for the " total lack of care " kelly received amid the frenzy surrounding his outing as the source for the bbc report that questioned an integral statement in the government ’ s iraq dossier . bbc man used kelly as source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan .
the bbc ’ s andrew gilligan reported in may on the radio program today , and then subsequently in the national newspaper the mail on sunday , that the claim that saddam hussein could have chemical and biological weapons ready in 45 minutes was included in the government 's dossier despite the fact officials knew it to be false .
it was later revealed that dr. kelly was the person who passed on these doubts to the journalist . it is claimed that the imminent exposure from being named and pressure from the government finally led to kelly taking his own life .

jeremy gompertz q.c. representing dr. kelly ’ s relatives told the inquiry that the scientist ’ s family wanted to expose the government 's " duplicity " in the way it treated the scientist before his apparent suicide , adding that kelly had been used as “ a pawn ” in the government ’ s political battle with the bbc .
however , gompertz maintained that the weapons expert ’ s family were not looking for " revenge or retribution " on any " scapegoats " but wanted to help identify and correct " systemic failures " at the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- , dr. kelly ’ s employers . " never again should someone be put in such a position , " said gompertz , who accused both the government and the media for the " total lack of care " kelly received amid the frenzy surrounding his outing as the source for the bbc report that questioned an integral statement in the government ’ s iraq dossier . bbc man used kelly as source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan .
the bbc ’ s andrew gilligan reported in may on the radio program today , and then subsequently in the national newspaper the mail on sunday , that the claim that saddam hussein could have chemical and biological weapons ready in 45 minutes was included in the government 's dossier despite the fact officials knew it to be false .
it was later revealed that dr. kelly was the person who passed on these doubts to the journalist . it is claimed that the imminent exposure from being named and pressure from the government finally led to kelly taking his own life .
gompertz said no credence should be given to gilligan 's account of his talks with kelly , except where it could be corroborated by independent sources . caught in the crossfire the reporting of the 45 minute claim put the bbc and the government on a collision course , and kelly ’ s lawyer pointed out in his closing address that the scientist was caught in the middle .

dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .
the bulk of the savings will come by scaling back on special benefits and coverage for expensive dental work .
key points of reform : dentures : after 2005 replacement teeth will no longer be covered under the statutory health insurance plan .
patients must pay for dentures out of their own pocket or insure them with an extra income-based dental policy .
families are automatically insured through the main policy holder .
individuals in the public insurance plan can also opt to sign a dental policy with private insurers .
families are not covered in the private plans .
sick pay : starting in 2006 employers will be required to pay all wages for workers after the seventh week of sick leave without receiving subsidies from the insurance companies .
the individual worker will be required to pay a supplementary premium of 0.5 percent .
sick pay up to the sixth week of illness is completely covered by health insurance .
additional fees : in general patients will be required to make a copayment of € 5 or , at the most , € 10 on all care they receive .
the additional fees are not to surpass € 10 euros per quarter for individual medical and dental treatment and is not required for treatment based on referrals .
hospital care will also cost € 10 a day for a maximum of 28 days per year .
out-patient care and house visits carry an additional price tag of € 10 plus 10 percent of the overall medical bill .
none of the supplementary fees may exceed the ceiling of 2 percent of income or 1 percent for chronically ill patients .
reductions : health insurerance will no longer pay for taxi rides to out-patient treatment .
sterilization for non-medical related reasons has been cut entirely from the budget and coverage for fertilization will be limited .
subsidies for glasses and other sight aids will only be covered for patients under 18 years and for the severely handicapped .
the previously paid birth and death supplements -lrb- although not the medical costs related to having a child -rrb- will be cut in the future .
and patients will have to pay for a broad series of prescription-free medicine instead of relying on subsidies from their insurer .
patients : patients who can prove they have taken advantage of preventive care may receive a financial bonus from insurers .
out-patient treatment within the eu will be covered , but for a hospital stay approval from the insurer is required .
doctors : they will be required to show proof of continuing education otherwise they will suffer disadvantages in reimbursement from the insurers .
insurers must cover doctors ’ house visits and hospitals may offer out-patient treatment in a patient ’ s home .
pharmaceutical industry : pharmacies are required to offer medication at the cheapest price available , even for re-imports .
mail order pharmacies are permitted under the new law .
pharmacists may now own up to three branches and there is no longer a fixed price on medication .
contributions : the current fee requiring a contribution of 14.3 percent of income for employees will be reduced next year to 13.6 and in 2006 to 12.15 percent .
the current practice of splitting the costs equally between employer and employee will continue .
insurers : the reforms are expected to save the insurers up to € 9 billion .

germany may be experiencing a new round of cuddly nostalgia about everyday life in east germany , but memories of its darker side have resurfaced following the arrest of a suspected member of the regime ’ s assassin squad . east germany may have imploded in 1989 when the berlin wall fell , but the failed communist state has been making a comeback – at least in the minds of some germans – following a recent wave of german television revival shows . ostalgie , a play on words meaning nostalgia of the east , has gripped many easterners as they look back fondly at the everyday life during their salad days before the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- was swallowed by the capitalist west germany in 1990 . but just as some critics have warned ostalgie often glosses over the gdr ’ s nastier side , a prime example of how ruthless the totalitarian regime was surfaced this week : german federal prosecutors announced that they had arrested a suspected east german contract killer on monday . identified only as jürgen g. , as is the custom in germany not to give the last name , the 53 year-old is thought to have worked as a hit man from 1976 to 1987 while part of a gdr commando unit .
“ the suspect is believed to have killed a number of people that were considered by the gdr regime to have committed treason or likely to , ” prosecutors said . it is the first time anyone has been arrested for suspicion of working as an assassin for the east german state .
the highly feared east german secret police , or stasi , has long been suspected of having a death squad , even though top communist officials denied its existence after the wall fell . “ liquidating ” traitors stasi expert hubertus knabe believes the organization may have had hundreds of operatives for “ liquidating ” traitors .
“ besides sabotage they were also supposed to murder , ” he told the german news agency dpa . although there have been several mysterious deaths beyond east germany ’ s borders that have been linked to the stasi , there has never been hard evidence to prove the existence of the killer commandos . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lutz eigendorf died under mysterious circumstances in 1983 .
lutz eigendorf , an eastern soccer player who defected to west germany in 1979 , died in an apparent car crash in 1983 in the western town of braunschweig . although alcohol was found in his bloodstream , the level was considered far too high for eigendorf to have drank in less than two hours . having once played for the stasi-favored bfc dynamo in berlin , it is rumored stasi boss erich mielke personally ordered his murder . and according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , a three-man killer squad from the stasi was also involved in the 1984 death of swedish television journalist cats falk , who was investigating illegal high-tech shipments between the gdr and swedish arms firms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.09.2003 parliament approves massive healthcare reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in germany 's bundestag passed the first of gerhard schröder 's political reform bills in a difficult vote .
the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .
the health reform bill is only the first of 11 pieces of legislation to be brought into parliament this autumn as part of schröder 's agenda 2010 reform platform .
in the past schröder has threatened to resign if his party refused to follow him in parliament .
the chancellor is said to have avoided this tactic on thursday , but reports said he warned members of parliament of the consequences of a loss of momentum in the reform process .
speaking to reporters after the vote , schröder ’ s spokesman bela anda said , " the chancellor does not threaten to resign .
but he emphasized the importance of the agenda 2010 measures being passed with an own -lrb- meaning spd-greens -rrb- majority . "
" it is important not only for the health care reform vote today but also for further votes down the road on agenda 2010 reforms , " he said .
the bill still requires approval from germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , but that body is expected to pass the law as soon as mid-october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system .
critics say those insured will have to dig deeper into their pockets -lrb- aug .

in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder returned home on thursday from the un meeting on the future of iraq with germany 's diplomatic star in the ascendant again , after months of strife with the united states over iraq . the chancellor 's plane had hardly finished taxiing into a berlin airport before a tired-looking schröder was on his way to the german parliament to report the good news . the month-long diplomatic rift between the u.s. and germany over iraq was , in the words of u.s. president george w. bush , " over , " and the international community was on its way to taking decisive steps to secure future stability in postwar iraq . a free democratic future addressing the german parliament , schröder drew a line in the sand over the arguments over war in iraq which had soured u.s.-german relations and focused solely on the future in the persian gulf region . " independent of whether countries were for or against the war -lrb- on iraq -rrb- , it is now paramount that the international community ensures the new iraq is free , democratic and stable , " he told german parliamentarians . germany is in agreement with france and the united states that a new iraqi constitution must be drawn up as soon as possible and free elections , under the auspices of the un , should take place , although no timescale for that has been set as yet . no german military involvement but although schröder said germany was ready to provide humanitarian , technical and economic aid for the reconstruction efforts and train up iraqi security personnel , he rejected sending german troops to the region and said he did not support plans to beef up the numbers of foreign troops already there to increase security . " my personal view is that , in this current phase , it 's not about increasing the numbers of foreign troops in the region , rather that security can be ensured by training iraqi security personnel , " schröder said .
" iraqis have the ability to communicate with their own people and have the necessary understanding of the iraqi mentality and culture to be able to ensure long term security in the region -lrb- better than foreign troops -rrb- . " tough times ahead meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer - who cut short his trip to the states to return to german for friday 's first crucial first vote on the german government 's agenda 2010 reform package - warned that the toughest times for iraq have yet to come . " the reality today is this : if reconstruction in iraq goes wrong ; if irresponsible or terrorist powers flourish , then we will have an awful price to pay , regardless of whether we were for or against the war , " fischer said .
" however , it makes no sense to pursue a strategy that only makes the problems bigger , rather than reducing them . " fischer called for the un to play greater role in postwar iraq , although cautioned it was not realistic for u.s. and allied troops to pull out of the region immediately .
that would be , he said , a move which would lead to the " opening of a vacuum " and could be exploited .
singing from schröder 's hymn sheet , he said the discussion on the sidelines of tuesday 's un meeting in new york had brought all involved closer along the road to making difficult decisions . " whether the presence of occupying forces is really perceived as a liberating force in the reconstruction of a democratic state , is a decisive political question , " he said .
" we should do everything in our power to ensure that the second part of this is prioritized .
this is going to be difficult and a long term effort : we have already experienced it in afghanistan , but these basic decisions are of central importance .

" -lrb- we should -rrb- do our part as well as we can , shoulder our responsibility for the international community and i think it -lrb- a permanent seat on the security council -rrb- will come as a matter of course , he said , but cautioned .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.09.2003 parliament approves massive healthcare reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in germany 's bundestag passed the first of gerhard schröder 's political reform bills in a difficult vote .
the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .
the health reform bill is only the first of 11 pieces of legislation to be brought into parliament this autumn as part of schröder 's agenda 2010 reform platform .
in the past schröder has threatened to resign if his party refused to follow him in parliament .
the chancellor is said to have avoided this tactic on thursday , but reports said he warned members of parliament of the consequences of a loss of momentum in the reform process .
speaking to reporters after the vote , schröder ’ s spokesman bela anda said , " the chancellor does not threaten to resign .
but he emphasized the importance of the agenda 2010 measures being passed with an own -lrb- meaning spd-greens -rrb- majority . "
" it is important not only for the health care reform vote today but also for further votes down the road on agenda 2010 reforms , " he said .
the bill still requires approval from germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , but that body is expected to pass the law as soon as mid-october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system .

germany may be experiencing a new round of cuddly nostalgia about everyday life in east germany , but memories of its darker side have resurfaced following the arrest of a suspected member of the regime ’ s assassin squad . east germany may have imploded in 1989 when the berlin wall fell , but the failed communist state has been making a comeback – at least in the minds of some germans – following a recent wave of german television revival shows . ostalgie , a play on words meaning nostalgia of the east , has gripped many easterners as they look back fondly at the everyday life during their salad days before the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- was swallowed by the capitalist west germany in 1990 . but just as some critics have warned ostalgie often glosses over the gdr ’ s nastier side , a prime example of how ruthless the totalitarian regime was surfaced this week : german federal prosecutors announced that they had arrested a suspected east german contract killer on monday . identified only as jürgen g. , as is the custom in germany not to give the last name , the 53 year-old is thought to have worked as a hit man from 1976 to 1987 while part of a gdr commando unit .
“ the suspect is believed to have killed a number of people that were considered by the gdr regime to have committed treason or likely to , ” prosecutors said . it is the first time anyone has been arrested for suspicion of working as an assassin for the east german state .

dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .

reductions : health insurerance will no longer pay for taxi rides to out-patient treatment .
sterilization for non-medical related reasons has been cut entirely from the budget and coverage for fertilization will be limited .
subsidies for glasses and other sight aids will only be covered for patients under 18 years and for the severely handicapped .

and patients will have to pay for a broad series of prescription-free medicine instead of relying on subsidies from their insurer .
patients : patients who can prove they have taken advantage of preventive care may receive a financial bonus from insurers .
out-patient treatment within the eu will be covered , but for a hospital stay approval from the insurer is required .

germany may be experiencing a new round of cuddly nostalgia about everyday life in east germany , but memories of its darker side have resurfaced following the arrest of a suspected member of the regime ’ s assassin squad . east germany may have imploded in 1989 when the berlin wall fell , but the failed communist state has been making a comeback – at least in the minds of some germans – following a recent wave of german television revival shows . ostalgie , a play on words meaning nostalgia of the east , has gripped many easterners as they look back fondly at the everyday life during their salad days before the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- was swallowed by the capitalist west germany in 1990 . but just as some critics have warned ostalgie often glosses over the gdr ’ s nastier side , a prime example of how ruthless the totalitarian regime was surfaced this week : german federal prosecutors announced that they had arrested a suspected east german contract killer on monday . identified only as jürgen g. , as is the custom in germany not to give the last name , the 53 year-old is thought to have worked as a hit man from 1976 to 1987 while part of a gdr commando unit .

germany may be experiencing a new round of cuddly nostalgia about everyday life in east germany , but memories of its darker side have resurfaced following the arrest of a suspected member of the regime ’ s assassin squad . east germany may have imploded in 1989 when the berlin wall fell , but the failed communist state has been making a comeback – at least in the minds of some germans – following a recent wave of german television revival shows . ostalgie , a play on words meaning nostalgia of the east , has gripped many easterners as they look back fondly at the everyday life during their salad days before the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- was swallowed by the capitalist west germany in 1990 . but just as some critics have warned ostalgie often glosses over the gdr ’ s nastier side , a prime example of how ruthless the totalitarian regime was surfaced this week : german federal prosecutors announced that they had arrested a suspected east german contract killer on monday . identified only as jürgen g. , as is the custom in germany not to give the last name , the 53 year-old is thought to have worked as a hit man from 1976 to 1987 while part of a gdr commando unit .
“ the suspect is believed to have killed a number of people that were considered by the gdr regime to have committed treason or likely to , ” prosecutors said . it is the first time anyone has been arrested for suspicion of working as an assassin for the east german state .

jeremy gompertz q.c. representing dr. kelly ’ s relatives told the inquiry that the scientist ’ s family wanted to expose the government 's " duplicity " in the way it treated the scientist before his apparent suicide , adding that kelly had been used as “ a pawn ” in the government ’ s political battle with the bbc .
however , gompertz maintained that the weapons expert ’ s family were not looking for " revenge or retribution " on any " scapegoats " but wanted to help identify and correct " systemic failures " at the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- , dr. kelly ’ s employers . " never again should someone be put in such a position , " said gompertz , who accused both the government and the media for the " total lack of care " kelly received amid the frenzy surrounding his outing as the source for the bbc report that questioned an integral statement in the government ’ s iraq dossier . bbc man used kelly as source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan .
the bbc ’ s andrew gilligan reported in may on the radio program today , and then subsequently in the national newspaper the mail on sunday , that the claim that saddam hussein could have chemical and biological weapons ready in 45 minutes was included in the government 's dossier despite the fact officials knew it to be false .
it was later revealed that dr. kelly was the person who passed on these doubts to the journalist . it is claimed that the imminent exposure from being named and pressure from the government finally led to kelly taking his own life .
gompertz said no credence should be given to gilligan 's account of his talks with kelly , except where it could be corroborated by independent sources . caught in the crossfire the reporting of the 45 minute claim put the bbc and the government on a collision course , and kelly ’ s lawyer pointed out in his closing address that the scientist was caught in the middle .
gompertz attacked the " hypocrisy " of the british government for denying there was a strategy to use kelly in the dossier row with the bbc .
" this was a cynical abuse of power which deserves the strongest possible condemnation . " he concluded : " no wonder dr kelly felt betrayed after giving his life in service to the country ... in his despair , he seems to have taken his own life . " government cleared twice of wrong-doing both the hutton inquiry and the previous investigation by the foreign affairs committee have cleared the british government of deliberately inserting information known to be false but both have reprimanded the government for issuing misleading information and for not clarifying important data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
defense minister geoff hoon has been singled out for condemnation for his role in maintaining the ambiguity surrounding the 45 minute claim despite concerns raised by staff at the mod and for authorizing the press statement which led to dr kelly being named as the suspected source . iraq text approved at highest level in his final speech , jonathan sumption , the lawyer representing the government , defended the " rigorous " way the iraq dossier was prepared and added that the 45 minute claim was at the " conservative end of the scale " indicated by intelligence . sumption told the inquiry that every suggestion for the dossier made by alistair campbell and downing street official jonathan powell had been " scrupulously considered " by joint intelligence committee chairman john scarlett and assessment officials against the intelligence .
he added that there was no way that such an important document , one that would have been presented and defended in parliament by the prime minister himself , would not have been personally approved by tony blair . sumption also went on to deny that government had ever been engaged in any " crusade " against the bbc .
the government 's reaction was not due to any clash of personalities , but because the prime minister and his top staff all knew gilligan 's story was a " travesty " . media lawyers to deliver closings the bbc lawyers , representatives of andrew gilligan and the hutton inquiry barristers themselves will make their closing statements towards the end of the final hearing .

dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .
the bulk of the savings will come by scaling back on special benefits and coverage for expensive dental work .

none of the supplementary fees may exceed the ceiling of 2 percent of income or 1 percent for chronically ill patients .
reductions : health insurerance will no longer pay for taxi rides to out-patient treatment .
sterilization for non-medical related reasons has been cut entirely from the budget and coverage for fertilization will be limited .
subsidies for glasses and other sight aids will only be covered for patients under 18 years and for the severely handicapped .

and patients will have to pay for a broad series of prescription-free medicine instead of relying on subsidies from their insurer .
patients : patients who can prove they have taken advantage of preventive care may receive a financial bonus from insurers .
out-patient treatment within the eu will be covered , but for a hospital stay approval from the insurer is required .

the current practice of splitting the costs equally between employer and employee will continue .

the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .
the health reform bill is only the first of 11 pieces of legislation to be brought into parliament this autumn as part of schröder 's agenda 2010 reform platform .
in the past schröder has threatened to resign if his party refused to follow him in parliament .
the chancellor is said to have avoided this tactic on thursday , but reports said he warned members of parliament of the consequences of a loss of momentum in the reform process .
speaking to reporters after the vote , schröder ’ s spokesman bela anda said , " the chancellor does not threaten to resign .
but he emphasized the importance of the agenda 2010 measures being passed with an own -lrb- meaning spd-greens -rrb- majority . "
" it is important not only for the health care reform vote today but also for further votes down the road on agenda 2010 reforms , " he said .
the bill still requires approval from germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , but that body is expected to pass the law as soon as mid-october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system .

jeremy gompertz q.c. representing dr. kelly ’ s relatives told the inquiry that the scientist ’ s family wanted to expose the government 's " duplicity " in the way it treated the scientist before his apparent suicide , adding that kelly had been used as “ a pawn ” in the government ’ s political battle with the bbc .
however , gompertz maintained that the weapons expert ’ s family were not looking for " revenge or retribution " on any " scapegoats " but wanted to help identify and correct " systemic failures " at the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- , dr. kelly ’ s employers . " never again should someone be put in such a position , " said gompertz , who accused both the government and the media for the " total lack of care " kelly received amid the frenzy surrounding his outing as the source for the bbc report that questioned an integral statement in the government ’ s iraq dossier . bbc man used kelly as source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan .
the bbc ’ s andrew gilligan reported in may on the radio program today , and then subsequently in the national newspaper the mail on sunday , that the claim that saddam hussein could have chemical and biological weapons ready in 45 minutes was included in the government 's dossier despite the fact officials knew it to be false .
it was later revealed that dr. kelly was the person who passed on these doubts to the journalist . it is claimed that the imminent exposure from being named and pressure from the government finally led to kelly taking his own life .
gompertz said no credence should be given to gilligan 's account of his talks with kelly , except where it could be corroborated by independent sources . caught in the crossfire the reporting of the 45 minute claim put the bbc and the government on a collision course , and kelly ’ s lawyer pointed out in his closing address that the scientist was caught in the middle .
gompertz attacked the " hypocrisy " of the british government for denying there was a strategy to use kelly in the dossier row with the bbc .
" this was a cynical abuse of power which deserves the strongest possible condemnation .

jeremy gompertz q.c. representing dr. kelly ’ s relatives told the inquiry that the scientist ’ s family wanted to expose the government 's " duplicity " in the way it treated the scientist before his apparent suicide , adding that kelly had been used as “ a pawn ” in the government ’ s political battle with the bbc .
however , gompertz maintained that the weapons expert ’ s family were not looking for " revenge or retribution " on any " scapegoats " but wanted to help identify and correct " systemic failures " at the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- , dr. kelly ’ s employers . " never again should someone be put in such a position , " said gompertz , who accused both the government and the media for the " total lack of care " kelly received amid the frenzy surrounding his outing as the source for the bbc report that questioned an integral statement in the government ’ s iraq dossier . bbc man used kelly as source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan .
the bbc ’ s andrew gilligan reported in may on the radio program today , and then subsequently in the national newspaper the mail on sunday , that the claim that saddam hussein could have chemical and biological weapons ready in 45 minutes was included in the government 's dossier despite the fact officials knew it to be false .
it was later revealed that dr. kelly was the person who passed on these doubts to the journalist . it is claimed that the imminent exposure from being named and pressure from the government finally led to kelly taking his own life .
gompertz said no credence should be given to gilligan 's account of his talks with kelly , except where it could be corroborated by independent sources . caught in the crossfire the reporting of the 45 minute claim put the bbc and the government on a collision course , and kelly ’ s lawyer pointed out in his closing address that the scientist was caught in the middle .
gompertz attacked the " hypocrisy " of the british government for denying there was a strategy to use kelly in the dossier row with the bbc .
" this was a cynical abuse of power which deserves the strongest possible condemnation . " he concluded : " no wonder dr kelly felt betrayed after giving his life in service to the country ... in his despair , he seems to have taken his own life . " government cleared twice of wrong-doing both the hutton inquiry and the previous investigation by the foreign affairs committee have cleared the british government of deliberately inserting information known to be false but both have reprimanded the government for issuing misleading information and for not clarifying important data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .
defense minister geoff hoon has been singled out for condemnation for his role in maintaining the ambiguity surrounding the 45 minute claim despite concerns raised by staff at the mod and for authorizing the press statement which led to dr kelly being named as the suspected source . iraq text approved at highest level in his final speech , jonathan sumption , the lawyer representing the government , defended the " rigorous " way the iraq dossier was prepared and added that the 45 minute claim was at the " conservative end of the scale " indicated by intelligence . sumption told the inquiry that every suggestion for the dossier made by alistair campbell and downing street official jonathan powell had been " scrupulously considered " by joint intelligence committee chairman john scarlett and assessment officials against the intelligence .
he added that there was no way that such an important document , one that would have been presented and defended in parliament by the prime minister himself , would not have been personally approved by tony blair . sumption also went on to deny that government had ever been engaged in any " crusade " against the bbc .
the government 's reaction was not due to any clash of personalities , but because the prime minister and his top staff all knew gilligan 's story was a " travesty " . media lawyers to deliver closings the bbc lawyers , representatives of andrew gilligan and the hutton inquiry barristers themselves will make their closing statements towards the end of the final hearing .

the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .
the health reform bill is only the first of 11 pieces of legislation to be brought into parliament this autumn as part of schröder 's agenda 2010 reform platform .
in the past schröder has threatened to resign if his party refused to follow him in parliament .
the chancellor is said to have avoided this tactic on thursday , but reports said he warned members of parliament of the consequences of a loss of momentum in the reform process .
speaking to reporters after the vote , schröder ’ s spokesman bela anda said , " the chancellor does not threaten to resign .
but he emphasized the importance of the agenda 2010 measures being passed with an own -lrb- meaning spd-greens -rrb- majority . "
" it is important not only for the health care reform vote today but also for further votes down the road on agenda 2010 reforms , " he said .
the bill still requires approval from germany 's upper legislative chamber , the bundesrat , but that body is expected to pass the law as soon as mid-october . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de government , opposition reach compromise on health reform government and opposition parties forged a draft reform of germany 's expensive healthcare system .

dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .
the bulk of the savings will come by scaling back on special benefits and coverage for expensive dental work .
key points of reform : dentures : after 2005 replacement teeth will no longer be covered under the statutory health insurance plan .
patients must pay for dentures out of their own pocket or insure them with an extra income-based dental policy .
families are automatically insured through the main policy holder .
individuals in the public insurance plan can also opt to sign a dental policy with private insurers .
families are not covered in the private plans .
sick pay : starting in 2006 employers will be required to pay all wages for workers after the seventh week of sick leave without receiving subsidies from the insurance companies .
the individual worker will be required to pay a supplementary premium of 0.5 percent .
sick pay up to the sixth week of illness is completely covered by health insurance .
additional fees : in general patients will be required to make a copayment of € 5 or , at the most , € 10 on all care they receive .
the additional fees are not to surpass € 10 euros per quarter for individual medical and dental treatment and is not required for treatment based on referrals .
hospital care will also cost € 10 a day for a maximum of 28 days per year .
out-patient care and house visits carry an additional price tag of € 10 plus 10 percent of the overall medical bill .
none of the supplementary fees may exceed the ceiling of 2 percent of income or 1 percent for chronically ill patients .
reductions : health insurerance will no longer pay for taxi rides to out-patient treatment .
sterilization for non-medical related reasons has been cut entirely from the budget and coverage for fertilization will be limited .
subsidies for glasses and other sight aids will only be covered for patients under 18 years and for the severely handicapped .
the previously paid birth and death supplements -lrb- although not the medical costs related to having a child -rrb- will be cut in the future .
and patients will have to pay for a broad series of prescription-free medicine instead of relying on subsidies from their insurer .
patients : patients who can prove they have taken advantage of preventive care may receive a financial bonus from insurers .
out-patient treatment within the eu will be covered , but for a hospital stay approval from the insurer is required .
doctors : they will be required to show proof of continuing education otherwise they will suffer disadvantages in reimbursement from the insurers .
insurers must cover doctors ’ house visits and hospitals may offer out-patient treatment in a patient ’ s home .
pharmaceutical industry : pharmacies are required to offer medication at the cheapest price available , even for re-imports .
mail order pharmacies are permitted under the new law .
pharmacists may now own up to three branches and there is no longer a fixed price on medication .
contributions : the current fee requiring a contribution of 14.3 percent of income for employees will be reduced next year to 13.6 and in 2006 to 12.15 percent .
the current practice of splitting the costs equally between employer and employee will continue .
insurers : the reforms are expected to save the insurers up to € 9 billion .
from that amount they will be able to chop off € 3 billion in debts and pay for the reduced contributions .
within four years they will be expected to have completely eliminated their deficits . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliament approves massive healthcare reforms the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .

in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder returned home on thursday from the un meeting on the future of iraq with germany 's diplomatic star in the ascendant again , after months of strife with the united states over iraq . the chancellor 's plane had hardly finished taxiing into a berlin airport before a tired-looking schröder was on his way to the german parliament to report the good news . the month-long diplomatic rift between the u.s. and germany over iraq was , in the words of u.s. president george w. bush , " over , " and the international community was on its way to taking decisive steps to secure future stability in postwar iraq . a free democratic future addressing the german parliament , schröder drew a line in the sand over the arguments over war in iraq which had soured u.s.-german relations and focused solely on the future in the persian gulf region . " independent of whether countries were for or against the war -lrb- on iraq -rrb- , it is now paramount that the international community ensures the new iraq is free , democratic and stable , " he told german parliamentarians . germany is in agreement with france and the united states that a new iraqi constitution must be drawn up as soon as possible and free elections , under the auspices of the un , should take place , although no timescale for that has been set as yet . no german military involvement but although schröder said germany was ready to provide humanitarian , technical and economic aid for the reconstruction efforts and train up iraqi security personnel , he rejected sending german troops to the region and said he did not support plans to beef up the numbers of foreign troops already there to increase security . " my personal view is that , in this current phase , it 's not about increasing the numbers of foreign troops in the region , rather that security can be ensured by training iraqi security personnel , " schröder said .
" iraqis have the ability to communicate with their own people and have the necessary understanding of the iraqi mentality and culture to be able to ensure long term security in the region -lrb- better than foreign troops -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 26.09.2003 parliament approves massive healthcare reforms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politicians in germany 's bundestag passed the first of gerhard schröder 's political reform bills in a difficult vote .
the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .

in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder returned home on thursday from the un meeting on the future of iraq with germany 's diplomatic star in the ascendant again , after months of strife with the united states over iraq . the chancellor 's plane had hardly finished taxiing into a berlin airport before a tired-looking schröder was on his way to the german parliament to report the good news . the month-long diplomatic rift between the u.s. and germany over iraq was , in the words of u.s. president george w. bush , " over , " and the international community was on its way to taking decisive steps to secure future stability in postwar iraq . a free democratic future addressing the german parliament , schröder drew a line in the sand over the arguments over war in iraq which had soured u.s.-german relations and focused solely on the future in the persian gulf region . " independent of whether countries were for or against the war -lrb- on iraq -rrb- , it is now paramount that the international community ensures the new iraq is free , democratic and stable , " he told german parliamentarians . germany is in agreement with france and the united states that a new iraqi constitution must be drawn up as soon as possible and free elections , under the auspices of the un , should take place , although no timescale for that has been set as yet . no german military involvement but although schröder said germany was ready to provide humanitarian , technical and economic aid for the reconstruction efforts and train up iraqi security personnel , he rejected sending german troops to the region and said he did not support plans to beef up the numbers of foreign troops already there to increase security . " my personal view is that , in this current phase , it 's not about increasing the numbers of foreign troops in the region , rather that security can be ensured by training iraqi security personnel , " schröder said .
" iraqis have the ability to communicate with their own people and have the necessary understanding of the iraqi mentality and culture to be able to ensure long term security in the region -lrb- better than foreign troops -rrb- . " tough times ahead meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer - who cut short his trip to the states to return to german for friday 's first crucial first vote on the german government 's agenda 2010 reform package - warned that the toughest times for iraq have yet to come . " the reality today is this : if reconstruction in iraq goes wrong ; if irresponsible or terrorist powers flourish , then we will have an awful price to pay , regardless of whether we were for or against the war , " fischer said .
" however , it makes no sense to pursue a strategy that only makes the problems bigger , rather than reducing them . " fischer called for the un to play greater role in postwar iraq , although cautioned it was not realistic for u.s. and allied troops to pull out of the region immediately .
that would be , he said , a move which would lead to the " opening of a vacuum " and could be exploited .
singing from schröder 's hymn sheet , he said the discussion on the sidelines of tuesday 's un meeting in new york had brought all involved closer along the road to making difficult decisions . " whether the presence of occupying forces is really perceived as a liberating force in the reconstruction of a democratic state , is a decisive political question , " he said .
" we should do everything in our power to ensure that the second part of this is prioritized .
this is going to be difficult and a long term effort : we have already experienced it in afghanistan , but these basic decisions are of central importance . " permanent security council seat fischer added that he believed now that germany 's role in the un had now grown it would now only be a matter of time before the country gains a permanent seat on the un security council . " -lrb- we should -rrb- do our part as well as we can , shoulder our responsibility for the international community and i think it -lrb- a permanent seat on the security council -rrb- will come as a matter of course , he said , but cautioned .

the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .
internal strife failure to muster a parliamentary majority of its own in the 603-seat bundestag would have come as a major blow to the center-left government .
the health reform bill is only the first of 11 pieces of legislation to be brought into parliament this autumn as part of schröder 's agenda 2010 reform platform .

the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .
the government ’ s plan calls for a € 20 billion reduction in healthcare spending . chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s government succeeded in obtaining a large majority in the bundestag after critics in his own party threatened to block passage of an expansive healthcare package .
in the end , parliament voted 517-54 in favor of the controversial overhaul , the first in a series of tough reforms designed to revive the economy .
despite fears the coalition government of social democrats and greens would fail to unite on the issue , the parties managed on friday to establish a majority vote on their own , without requiring the votes of the opposition christian democrats to push the legislation through . debate over the bill had sharply divided members of the government in recent days .
with it ’ s reform plan , schröder 's center-left government aims to slash billions of euros from german public health costs in an effort to reduce overall non-wage labor costs here , which are among the highest in the world .
economists believe non-wage labor costs make germany less competitive in the global market and have contributed to the country ’ s current economic woes , which have placed europe ’ s largest economy at the bottom of the heap in growth .
tough negotiations negotiations on the health reform package , which was hammered out with leaders from the conservative opposition christian democrats , have tested gerhard schröder 's mediating skills to the limit .
as late as thursday , the chancellor was forced to do some arm-twisting in order to make rebels within his own party toe the line .
debate within the coalition became so contentious that schröder and franz müntefering , who heads the social democrats ' parliamentary group , threatened to disband the spd-green party government coalition if they were unable to achieve a majority vote on their own .
" whoever believes they can cast a ‘ no ’ vote here today has no idea of political power and social democratic traditions , " german public broadcaster ard quoted müntefering as saying .
the bill calls for public health spending to be reduced by about € 20 billion within the next four years , largely by chopping down special benefits like sick pay and coverage for expensive dental work .
but a handful of members of parliament in schröder 's coalition of social democrats and greens objected to the bill , saying it would be socially harmful because the cuts will hit low and medium wage earners especially hard .
" the main problem is that a majority within our party consider the reforms socially unjust , " a social democratic member of parliament said .
" they have the impression that the party leadership is lacking political orientation . "
spd and green critics of the bill said it would place an unfair burden on patients – with the majority of the cuts , € 17 billion , to be shouldered by individual , and only € 3 billion to be picked up by the health industry .
but prominent social democrats defended both the bill and the compromises made with the christian democrats necessary for its passage .
gudrun schaich-walch , the deputy chairwoman of the spd ’ s parliamentary group , said it was necessary to lower insurance premiums in order to maintain a high-level of healthcare .
" we ’ re doing these reforms so that all insured people have access to what ’ s medically necessary , " she said , adding that the compromise reached with the opposition had been difficult but " fair . "
in the end , the government prevailed over its internal critics .
only six spd parliamentarians voted against the measure , and none of the greens said " no " to the reform .

germany may be experiencing a new round of cuddly nostalgia about everyday life in east germany , but memories of its darker side have resurfaced following the arrest of a suspected member of the regime ’ s assassin squad . east germany may have imploded in 1989 when the berlin wall fell , but the failed communist state has been making a comeback – at least in the minds of some germans – following a recent wave of german television revival shows . ostalgie , a play on words meaning nostalgia of the east , has gripped many easterners as they look back fondly at the everyday life during their salad days before the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- was swallowed by the capitalist west germany in 1990 . but just as some critics have warned ostalgie often glosses over the gdr ’ s nastier side , a prime example of how ruthless the totalitarian regime was surfaced this week : german federal prosecutors announced that they had arrested a suspected east german contract killer on monday . identified only as jürgen g. , as is the custom in germany not to give the last name , the 53 year-old is thought to have worked as a hit man from 1976 to 1987 while part of a gdr commando unit .

lutz eigendorf , an eastern soccer player who defected to west germany in 1979 , died in an apparent car crash in 1983 in the western town of braunschweig . although alcohol was found in his bloodstream , the level was considered far too high for eigendorf to have drank in less than two hours . having once played for the stasi-favored bfc dynamo in berlin , it is rumored stasi boss erich mielke personally ordered his murder . and according to the berliner zeitung newspaper , a three-man killer squad from the stasi was also involved in the 1984 death of swedish television journalist cats falk , who was investigating illegal high-tech shipments between the gdr and swedish arms firms .

germany may be experiencing a new round of cuddly nostalgia about everyday life in east germany , but memories of its darker side have resurfaced following the arrest of a suspected member of the regime ’ s assassin squad . east germany may have imploded in 1989 when the berlin wall fell , but the failed communist state has been making a comeback – at least in the minds of some germans – following a recent wave of german television revival shows . ostalgie , a play on words meaning nostalgia of the east , has gripped many easterners as they look back fondly at the everyday life during their salad days before the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- was swallowed by the capitalist west germany in 1990 . but just as some critics have warned ostalgie often glosses over the gdr ’ s nastier side , a prime example of how ruthless the totalitarian regime was surfaced this week : german federal prosecutors announced that they had arrested a suspected east german contract killer on monday . identified only as jürgen g. , as is the custom in germany not to give the last name , the 53 year-old is thought to have worked as a hit man from 1976 to 1987 while part of a gdr commando unit .
“ the suspect is believed to have killed a number of people that were considered by the gdr regime to have committed treason or likely to , ” prosecutors said . it is the first time anyone has been arrested for suspicion of working as an assassin for the east german state .

dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .
the bulk of the savings will come by scaling back on special benefits and coverage for expensive dental work .
key points of reform : dentures : after 2005 replacement teeth will no longer be covered under the statutory health insurance plan .
patients must pay for dentures out of their own pocket or insure them with an extra income-based dental policy .
families are automatically insured through the main policy holder .
individuals in the public insurance plan can also opt to sign a dental policy with private insurers .
families are not covered in the private plans .

hospital care will also cost € 10 a day for a maximum of 28 days per year .
out-patient care and house visits carry an additional price tag of € 10 plus 10 percent of the overall medical bill .
none of the supplementary fees may exceed the ceiling of 2 percent of income or 1 percent for chronically ill patients .
reductions : health insurerance will no longer pay for taxi rides to out-patient treatment .
sterilization for non-medical related reasons has been cut entirely from the budget and coverage for fertilization will be limited .
subsidies for glasses and other sight aids will only be covered for patients under 18 years and for the severely handicapped .
the previously paid birth and death supplements -lrb- although not the medical costs related to having a child -rrb- will be cut in the future .
and patients will have to pay for a broad series of prescription-free medicine instead of relying on subsidies from their insurer .
patients : patients who can prove they have taken advantage of preventive care may receive a financial bonus from insurers .
out-patient treatment within the eu will be covered , but for a hospital stay approval from the insurer is required .
doctors : they will be required to show proof of continuing education otherwise they will suffer disadvantages in reimbursement from the insurers .
insurers must cover doctors ’ house visits and hospitals may offer out-patient treatment in a patient ’ s home .
pharmaceutical industry : pharmacies are required to offer medication at the cheapest price available , even for re-imports .

the current practice of splitting the costs equally between employer and employee will continue .

jeremy gompertz q.c. representing dr. kelly ’ s relatives told the inquiry that the scientist ’ s family wanted to expose the government 's " duplicity " in the way it treated the scientist before his apparent suicide , adding that kelly had been used as “ a pawn ” in the government ’ s political battle with the bbc .
however , gompertz maintained that the weapons expert ’ s family were not looking for " revenge or retribution " on any " scapegoats " but wanted to help identify and correct " systemic failures " at the ministry of defence -lrb- mod -rrb- , dr. kelly ’ s employers . " never again should someone be put in such a position , " said gompertz , who accused both the government and the media for the " total lack of care " kelly received amid the frenzy surrounding his outing as the source for the bbc report that questioned an integral statement in the government ’ s iraq dossier . bbc man used kelly as source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andrew gilligan .
the bbc ’ s andrew gilligan reported in may on the radio program today , and then subsequently in the national newspaper the mail on sunday , that the claim that saddam hussein could have chemical and biological weapons ready in 45 minutes was included in the government 's dossier despite the fact officials knew it to be false .
it was later revealed that dr. kelly was the person who passed on these doubts to the journalist . it is claimed that the imminent exposure from being named and pressure from the government finally led to kelly taking his own life .
gompertz said no credence should be given to gilligan 's account of his talks with kelly , except where it could be corroborated by independent sources . caught in the crossfire the reporting of the 45 minute claim put the bbc and the government on a collision course , and kelly ’ s lawyer pointed out in his closing address that the scientist was caught in the middle .
gompertz attacked the " hypocrisy " of the british government for denying there was a strategy to use kelly in the dossier row with the bbc .
" this was a cynical abuse of power which deserves the strongest possible condemnation . " he concluded : " no wonder dr kelly felt betrayed after giving his life in service to the country ... in his despair , he seems to have taken his own life . " government cleared twice of wrong-doing both the hutton inquiry and the previous investigation by the foreign affairs committee have cleared the british government of deliberately inserting information known to be false but both have reprimanded the government for issuing misleading information and for not clarifying important data . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain 's defence secretary geoff hoon .

dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .
the bulk of the savings will come by scaling back on special benefits and coverage for expensive dental work .
key points of reform : dentures : after 2005 replacement teeth will no longer be covered under the statutory health insurance plan .

hospital care will also cost € 10 a day for a maximum of 28 days per year .
out-patient care and house visits carry an additional price tag of € 10 plus 10 percent of the overall medical bill .
none of the supplementary fees may exceed the ceiling of 2 percent of income or 1 percent for chronically ill patients .
reductions : health insurerance will no longer pay for taxi rides to out-patient treatment .
sterilization for non-medical related reasons has been cut entirely from the budget and coverage for fertilization will be limited .
subsidies for glasses and other sight aids will only be covered for patients under 18 years and for the severely handicapped .
the previously paid birth and death supplements -lrb- although not the medical costs related to having a child -rrb- will be cut in the future .
and patients will have to pay for a broad series of prescription-free medicine instead of relying on subsidies from their insurer .
patients : patients who can prove they have taken advantage of preventive care may receive a financial bonus from insurers .
out-patient treatment within the eu will be covered , but for a hospital stay approval from the insurer is required .
doctors : they will be required to show proof of continuing education otherwise they will suffer disadvantages in reimbursement from the insurers .
insurers must cover doctors ’ house visits and hospitals may offer out-patient treatment in a patient ’ s home .
pharmaceutical industry : pharmacies are required to offer medication at the cheapest price available , even for re-imports .

the current practice of splitting the costs equally between employer and employee will continue .

in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder returned home on thursday from the un meeting on the future of iraq with germany 's diplomatic star in the ascendant again , after months of strife with the united states over iraq . the chancellor 's plane had hardly finished taxiing into a berlin airport before a tired-looking schröder was on his way to the german parliament to report the good news . the month-long diplomatic rift between the u.s. and germany over iraq was , in the words of u.s. president george w. bush , " over , " and the international community was on its way to taking decisive steps to secure future stability in postwar iraq . a free democratic future addressing the german parliament , schröder drew a line in the sand over the arguments over war in iraq which had soured u.s.-german relations and focused solely on the future in the persian gulf region . " independent of whether countries were for or against the war -lrb- on iraq -rrb- , it is now paramount that the international community ensures the new iraq is free , democratic and stable , " he told german parliamentarians . germany is in agreement with france and the united states that a new iraqi constitution must be drawn up as soon as possible and free elections , under the auspices of the un , should take place , although no timescale for that has been set as yet . no german military involvement but although schröder said germany was ready to provide humanitarian , technical and economic aid for the reconstruction efforts and train up iraqi security personnel , he rejected sending german troops to the region and said he did not support plans to beef up the numbers of foreign troops already there to increase security . " my personal view is that , in this current phase , it 's not about increasing the numbers of foreign troops in the region , rather that security can be ensured by training iraqi security personnel , " schröder said .
" iraqis have the ability to communicate with their own people and have the necessary understanding of the iraqi mentality and culture to be able to ensure long term security in the region -lrb- better than foreign troops -rrb- . " tough times ahead meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer - who cut short his trip to the states to return to german for friday 's first crucial first vote on the german government 's agenda 2010 reform package - warned that the toughest times for iraq have yet to come . " the reality today is this : if reconstruction in iraq goes wrong ; if irresponsible or terrorist powers flourish , then we will have an awful price to pay , regardless of whether we were for or against the war , " fischer said .
" however , it makes no sense to pursue a strategy that only makes the problems bigger , rather than reducing them . " fischer called for the un to play greater role in postwar iraq , although cautioned it was not realistic for u.s. and allied troops to pull out of the region immediately .
that would be , he said , a move which would lead to the " opening of a vacuum " and could be exploited .
singing from schröder 's hymn sheet , he said the discussion on the sidelines of tuesday 's un meeting in new york had brought all involved closer along the road to making difficult decisions . " whether the presence of occupying forces is really perceived as a liberating force in the reconstruction of a democratic state , is a decisive political question , " he said .
" we should do everything in our power to ensure that the second part of this is prioritized .
this is going to be difficult and a long term effort : we have already experienced it in afghanistan , but these basic decisions are of central importance . " permanent security council seat fischer added that he believed now that germany 's role in the un had now grown it would now only be a matter of time before the country gains a permanent seat on the un security council . " -lrb- we should -rrb- do our part as well as we can , shoulder our responsibility for the international community and i think it -lrb- a permanent seat on the security council -rrb- will come as a matter of course , he said , but cautioned .
" we should n't pursue it as a policy of national prestige or rush ahead with it - that 's my advice . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reacts cautiously to iraq resolution in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given .

in his first speech to parliament after returning from new york , chancellor schröder says germany and the united states are back on track and looking to the future of iraq . german chancellor gerhard schröder returned home on thursday from the un meeting on the future of iraq with germany 's diplomatic star in the ascendant again , after months of strife with the united states over iraq . the chancellor 's plane had hardly finished taxiing into a berlin airport before a tired-looking schröder was on his way to the german parliament to report the good news . the month-long diplomatic rift between the u.s. and germany over iraq was , in the words of u.s. president george w. bush , " over , " and the international community was on its way to taking decisive steps to secure future stability in postwar iraq . a free democratic future addressing the german parliament , schröder drew a line in the sand over the arguments over war in iraq which had soured u.s.-german relations and focused solely on the future in the persian gulf region . " independent of whether countries were for or against the war -lrb- on iraq -rrb- , it is now paramount that the international community ensures the new iraq is free , democratic and stable , " he told german parliamentarians . germany is in agreement with france and the united states that a new iraqi constitution must be drawn up as soon as possible and free elections , under the auspices of the un , should take place , although no timescale for that has been set as yet . no german military involvement but although schröder said germany was ready to provide humanitarian , technical and economic aid for the reconstruction efforts and train up iraqi security personnel , he rejected sending german troops to the region and said he did not support plans to beef up the numbers of foreign troops already there to increase security . " my personal view is that , in this current phase , it 's not about increasing the numbers of foreign troops in the region , rather that security can be ensured by training iraqi security personnel , " schröder said .
" iraqis have the ability to communicate with their own people and have the necessary understanding of the iraqi mentality and culture to be able to ensure long term security in the region -lrb- better than foreign troops -rrb- . " tough times ahead meanwhile , german foreign minister joschka fischer - who cut short his trip to the states to return to german for friday 's first crucial first vote on the german government 's agenda 2010 reform package - warned that the toughest times for iraq have yet to come . " the reality today is this : if reconstruction in iraq goes wrong ; if irresponsible or terrorist powers flourish , then we will have an awful price to pay , regardless of whether we were for or against the war , " fischer said .
" however , it makes no sense to pursue a strategy that only makes the problems bigger , rather than reducing them . " fischer called for the un to play greater role in postwar iraq , although cautioned it was not realistic for u.s. and allied troops to pull out of the region immediately .
that would be , he said , a move which would lead to the " opening of a vacuum " and could be exploited .
singing from schröder 's hymn sheet , he said the discussion on the sidelines of tuesday 's un meeting in new york had brought all involved closer along the road to making difficult decisions . " whether the presence of occupying forces is really perceived as a liberating force in the reconstruction of a democratic state , is a decisive political question , " he said .
" we should do everything in our power to ensure that the second part of this is prioritized .
this is going to be difficult and a long term effort : we have already experienced it in afghanistan , but these basic decisions are of central importance . " permanent security council seat fischer added that he believed now that germany 's role in the un had now grown it would now only be a matter of time before the country gains a permanent seat on the un security council . " -lrb- we should -rrb- do our part as well as we can , shoulder our responsibility for the international community and i think it -lrb- a permanent seat on the security council -rrb- will come as a matter of course , he said , but cautioned .
" we should n't pursue it as a policy of national prestige or rush ahead with it - that 's my advice . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany reacts cautiously to iraq resolution in their first meeting in 16 months , schröder and bush agreed to put aside differences over military intervention in iraq , but german support for a u.s.-backed iraq resolution in the u.n. security council is not a given .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's path to reform a quick guide to ‘ agenda 2010 ’ revamping germany ’ s pension system labor market reforms spelled out german government accelerates tax cuts to boost economy germany -pipe- 26.09.2003 a look inside germany 's healthcare reforms in the first of several larger reforms , german parliament has passed a major healthcare package calling for patients to shoulder more of the country ’ s growing medical costs .
dw-world looks at the law 's main points . on friday germany ’ s government saw the first major reform package in its ambitious agenda 2010 platform pass through parliament .
the plan to overhaul the costly public healthcare system still has to pass through the country 's upper legislative chamber , which represents the states ’ interests , but since representatives from the opposition conservative christian democrat union worked with the government to hammer out the framework for the reform , it ’ s likely to get final approval there too .
the nearly 470-page document detailing measures to cut back on public healthcare spending was harshly criticized from within the government ’ s own coalition of social democrats and greens .
many said the reforms unfairly placed the financial burden on individual patients while doctors and the pharmaceutical industry walked away only having to shoulder about € 3 billion of the estimated € 20 billion in overall cuts .
the bulk of the savings will come by scaling back on special benefits and coverage for expensive dental work .
key points of reform : dentures : after 2005 replacement teeth will no longer be covered under the statutory health insurance plan .
patients must pay for dentures out of their own pocket or insure them with an extra income-based dental policy .
families are automatically insured through the main policy holder .
individuals in the public insurance plan can also opt to sign a dental policy with private insurers .
families are not covered in the private plans .
sick pay : starting in 2006 employers will be required to pay all wages for workers after the seventh week of sick leave without receiving subsidies from the insurance companies .
the individual worker will be required to pay a supplementary premium of 0.5 percent .
sick pay up to the sixth week of illness is completely covered by health insurance .
additional fees : in general patients will be required to make a copayment of € 5 or , at the most , € 10 on all care they receive .
the additional fees are not to surpass € 10 euros per quarter for individual medical and dental treatment and is not required for treatment based on referrals .
hospital care will also cost € 10 a day for a maximum of 28 days per year .
out-patient care and house visits carry an additional price tag of € 10 plus 10 percent of the overall medical bill .
none of the supplementary fees may exceed the ceiling of 2 percent of income or 1 percent for chronically ill patients .
reductions : health insurerance will no longer pay for taxi rides to out-patient treatment .
sterilization for non-medical related reasons has been cut entirely from the budget and coverage for fertilization will be limited .
subsidies for glasses and other sight aids will only be covered for patients under 18 years and for the severely handicapped .
the previously paid birth and death supplements -lrb- although not the medical costs related to having a child -rrb- will be cut in the future .
and patients will have to pay for a broad series of prescription-free medicine instead of relying on subsidies from their insurer .
patients : patients who can prove they have taken advantage of preventive care may receive a financial bonus from insurers .
out-patient treatment within the eu will be covered , but for a hospital stay approval from the insurer is required .
doctors : they will be required to show proof of continuing education otherwise they will suffer disadvantages in reimbursement from the insurers .
insurers must cover doctors ’ house visits and hospitals may offer out-patient treatment in a patient ’ s home .
pharmaceutical industry : pharmacies are required to offer medication at the cheapest price available , even for re-imports .
mail order pharmacies are permitted under the new law .
pharmacists may now own up to three branches and there is no longer a fixed price on medication .
contributions : the current fee requiring a contribution of 14.3 percent of income for employees will be reduced next year to 13.6 and in 2006 to 12.15 percent .
the current practice of splitting the costs equally between employer and employee will continue .
insurers : the reforms are expected to save the insurers up to € 9 billion .
from that amount they will be able to chop off € 3 billion in debts and pay for the reduced contributions .
within four years they will be expected to have completely eliminated their deficits . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de parliament approves massive healthcare reforms the german parliament on friday passed a law bringing about one of the largest reform packages in the history of public health care here .

it said more people were buying houses , so rising debt means " an increase in the number of households with debt , rather than an increase in the amount of debt per household . "
the bank said low inflation was also slowing the rate at which debts reduce in real terms .
rising debt does not therefore mean irresponsible spending by consumers , says the bbc 's evan davies . "
there is still plenty for critics to worry about in the way people are borrowing " the bbc 's evan davies but the bank could not account for all the increase in debts since 2000 , so critics will still worry , he added .
the average briton is said to have debts of nearly £ 3,500 .
the boom has raised concerns that britons are building up debts which they may find difficult to afford if interest rates rise , or if they lose their jobs .
commentators have also expressed concern about what effect such debt levels may have on the economy more generally .
some economists fear the debts will eventually become unmanageable and provoke a sharp slowdown in consumer spending .
debt tripled the boe 's relatively relaxed report echoes a paper delivered by boe monetary policy committee member steve nickell last week , which took a similarly relaxed tone about rising debt levels in the uk .
mervyn king , the boe 's governor , also took a fairly benign view earlier this month in front of the treasury select committee of mps .
the bank 's paper says household debt relative to income had increased by a quarter over the past five years , and had tripled since 1980 .
house prices in britain have more than doubled in the past few years , and interest rates are currently at a 48-year low of 3.5 % .
rate rise ?
mortgage equity withdrawal - where people borrow against their homes - is also at record levels , probably as people have found it the cheapest way to buy other things .
the study says that even if house prices stop rising , the rise in borrowing is likely to run on for some time .
" because only a relatively small fraction of the housing stock changes hands each year , the aggregate level of debt responds relatively slowly to changes in house prices .
" so the recent increases in house prices could lead to continuing increases in the debt-to-income ratio over the next five to 10 years . "
many economists believe that , with the bank likely to start raising interest rates soon in response to a recovery in the economy , debt growth could slow but is unlikely to go into reverse .

the bank 's paper says household debt relative to income had increased by a quarter over the past five years , and had tripled since 1980 .
house prices in britain have more than doubled in the past few years , and interest rates are currently at a 48-year low of 3.5 % .

many economists believe that , with the bank likely to start raising interest rates soon in response to a recovery in the economy , debt growth could slow but is unlikely to go into reverse .

nervous of upsetting america , the new us version of coupling proves hesitant and just not very funny .
the us version shies away from the smut of the uk one you have to watch the us and uk first episodes of coupling back to back to get the full shock : the british one is vastly better .
it is as if er were the one made here and casualty was american , the difference is that striking and is true from the writing and acting to how it is shot .
in the uk the opening episode had a mix of location filming with handheld cameras and good studio sets ; in america it 's like watching any of the three-wall , four-camera sitcoms videotaped in their dozens every year .

the uk version of coupling has become a cult hit but with steven moffat 's original script surviving translation surprisingly intact , the problem may be made worse by the acting .
throwaway jokes christopher moynihan , for instance , is not allowed to have lines that are quite as embarrassing as richard coyle 's in the british original but coyle convinces you he means them .
none of the new cast punch their lines home : there are times when you do not realise something was a joke until you see it in the british one and laugh .
nbc is promoting coupling as sexy and risqué but it has backed down over throwaway jokes about swallowing and refused outright to allow moynihan 's jeff to refer to girlfriends you ca n't get rid of as " unflushables " .
none of which should really matter because steven moffat does not rely on shocks : the strength of his jokes is that they come backed up with an uncomfortable sense of truth .
perhaps because these are early days for the us one , there is a sense of hesitant nervousness about how far things can go and unfortunately by concentrating on whether it will upset american sensibilities , the new coupling just forgets to be funny .

the sea pavilion - which would be built by the designers behind cornwall 's highly-successful eden project - would be erected four miles out to sea .
special solar powered ferries would take up to 500,000 tourists out to the attraction in rhyl every year .
it is hoped the attraction will create hundreds of jobs .
" the idea behind the sea pavilion is to provide a focus for the tidal energy scheme .
we 're looking to design it so it 'll have an exhibition centre , an auditorium and public facilities such as bookshops and cafes , " said architect florian eames .
" you 'll be able to go out there by boat from rhyl and see the actual whole thing working and because it 's about sustainable energy there 'll also be a wind turbine and a viewing platform , " he added .
tourism is vital to towns like rhyl the proposals are in the early stages , but those supporting it believe it could be just as popular as cornwall 's eden project , which is described as a " living theatre of plants and people " .
rhyl 's coastline changed dramatically when an off-shore windfarm was erected earlier this year .
the new scheme would utilise the sheltered waters created between the windfarm and the shoreline as a marina .
the scheme is the brainchild of dr stuart anderson , who works with the local charity community routes .
wind turbine he says the two-storey centre , which would house a major exhibition on offshore renewable energy , would be just one part of the scheme .
it would have flexible space to accommodate facilities like a cinema , auditorium , or research centre , as well as a comprehensive exhibition on renewable energy ideas .
visitors would be brought up to the exhibition spaces via a lift operating from just above the high-tide level .
the pavilion will be built around an 80m demonstration wind turbine , which would have a viewing platform .
a new pier would also be built and a tram system installed .
it is hoped the welsh development agency will help carry out a feasibility study to take the concept to the next level - to see , as dr anderson says , if it has " an economic heartbeat " .

investors rushed to sell the shares after they learned kodak plans to fund its switch to digital products by cutting its dividend pay-out to shareholders by 70 % .
kodak has cut thousands of jobs this year and watched profits fall as it struggled to cope with the popularity of new , digital photography .
but analysts warned that kodak 's decision - until now - to cling to its focus on its traditional markets of film , non-digital cameras and paper-based photographic printing means it is coming late to a crowded market .
' declining market ' kodak , famous for making cheap brownie cameras in the early days of photography , said it would spend $ 3bn on acquisitions and investments to develop new , digital business .
it also plans to use the money saved by cutting the dividend , traditionally one of the us stock markets ' steadiest and most lucrative payouts .
in 120 years , kodak has never before trimmed its dividend .
" we are acting in the knowledge that demand for traditional products is declining , especially in the developed markets , " said kodak chief executive daniel carp .
he set out ambitious targets to lift total group sales to $ 16bn -lrb- £ 9.6bn -rrb- by 2006 , and $ 20bn by 2010 .
kodak 's second quarter 2003 sales were $ 3.35bn , unchanged from year earlier ; quarterly sales have come in at roughly $ 3bn for the last year .
doubts but analysts believe that rivals like canon , sony , dell and hewlett-packard are already far ahead of kodak in developing digital photography .
credit ratings agency standard & poor 's cut its rating on kodak 's short and long term debts after the presentation , though it said the outlook for the stock was stable .
s & p said kodak 's past track record had been " mixed , and the company really needs to do a much better job of getting costs out to maintain very strong profitability and cash flow " .
" they have a lot to do , and i do n't know if they can do it , " said leslie fineberg of american capitol investors .
kodak cut its dividend by 50 cents from $ 1.80 .
its shares closed down , $ 4.84 , or 17.9 % lower , at $ 22.15 .
the stock price fall contributed to the fall in the dow jones industrial average on thursday , which closed down nearly 1 % .

investors rushed to sell the shares after they learned kodak plans to fund its switch to digital products by cutting its dividend pay-out to shareholders by 70 % .
kodak has cut thousands of jobs this year and watched profits fall as it struggled to cope with the popularity of new , digital photography .
but analysts warned that kodak 's decision - until now - to cling to its focus on its traditional markets of film , non-digital cameras and paper-based photographic printing means it is coming late to a crowded market .
' declining market ' kodak , famous for making cheap brownie cameras in the early days of photography , said it would spend $ 3bn on acquisitions and investments to develop new , digital business .
it also plans to use the money saved by cutting the dividend , traditionally one of the us stock markets ' steadiest and most lucrative payouts .
in 120 years , kodak has never before trimmed its dividend .
" we are acting in the knowledge that demand for traditional products is declining , especially in the developed markets , " said kodak chief executive daniel carp .
he set out ambitious targets to lift total group sales to $ 16bn -lrb- £ 9.6bn -rrb- by 2006 , and $ 20bn by 2010 .
kodak 's second quarter 2003 sales were $ 3.35bn , unchanged from year earlier ; quarterly sales have come in at roughly $ 3bn for the last year .
doubts but analysts believe that rivals like canon , sony , dell and hewlett-packard are already far ahead of kodak in developing digital photography .
credit ratings agency standard & poor 's cut its rating on kodak 's short and long term debts after the presentation , though it said the outlook for the stock was stable .
s & p said kodak 's past track record had been " mixed , and the company really needs to do a much better job of getting costs out to maintain very strong profitability and cash flow " .
" they have a lot to do , and i do n't know if they can do it , " said leslie fineberg of american capitol investors .
kodak cut its dividend by 50 cents from $ 1.80 .
its shares closed down , $ 4.84 , or 17.9 % lower , at $ 22.15 .
the stock price fall contributed to the fall in the dow jones industrial average on thursday , which closed down nearly 1 % .

wales ' 22 local education authorities -lrb- leas -rrb- say that more money is needed to fund schools , because teachers now have the right to refuse to do dozens of administrative tasks .
the workload agreement was signed in january this year between the department for education , the welsh assembly government , and teaching unions with the exception of the nut .
from 1 september , teachers in england and wales could no longer be asked routinely to do any administrative or clerical tasks .
we expected local authorities to start to make provisions for this agreement in their budgets jane davidson the change is part of the agreement on reducing teachers ' workloads being implemented over the next few years .
the tasks now intended to be carried out by support staff and teaching assistants include collecting money from pupils and parents , investigating a pupil 's absence and bulk photocopying .
the assembly government allocated £ 3m to cover the agreement .
true cost but now bbc radio wales has learned that local education authorities believe the true cost of servicing the agreement is £ 17m .
welsh education minister , jane davidson , disputes the figures , adding that all parties signed up to the original agreement .
she said : " local authorities have a contractual agreement to make sure they deliver teachers ' pay and conditions .
" we expected local authorities to start to make provisions for this agreement in their budgets . "
when asked if the assembly government was going to make up the alleged £ 14m shortfall , ms davidson said : " absolutely not , because we do n't accept the figures .
' work together ' " we 've asked them why they did n't make provision -lrb- for the agreement -rrb- in their education budgets .
" i would be very disappointed if leas were to abdicate from the agreement they signed .
" we all need to work together to make this work . "
but jeff jones , education spokesman for the welsh local government association , said the shortfall was an issue for government rather than local authorities .
he added : " there 's a £ 14m shortfall - we 've proved that .
" i 've written to every headteacher in my borough -lrb- bridgend -rrb- asking them how much they will need to implement this agreement .
" we 've heard this before - central government issues these initiatives and then expect the local taxpayer to fund them .
' positive move ' " teachers ' pay is an england and wales issue . "
mr jones also claimed that boroughs in england had been given more money than their welsh counterparts to implement the teacher workload agreement .
terry williams , headteacher of litchard junior school , in bridgend , said the agreement was positive , but had not been funded properly .
he said : " when i heard about the initiative i thought it was a positive move , but it has to be funded .
" eighty percent of my funding goes on teacher salaries and little goes on support materials .
" we need trained and properly-paid adults to come in and help teachers . "

cunard 's 150,000-tonne queen mary 2 , whose home port will be southampton , sailed from the french port of saint-nazaire for sea trials .
the new cunard flagship cost £ 540m and will accommodate some 2,600 passengers and 1,250 crew members .
hundreds of spectators gathered on the shore to applaud the ship as it set off for four days of sailing along the french coast .
like its predecessor the queen mary , the ship will undertake a measured mile speed trial and is expected to get up to 34 mph , or 30 knots .
naming ceremony about 450 technicians and engineers are on board to assess the liner 's seaworthiness in preparation for its maiden voyage in january .
peter shanks , cunard 's senior vice-president in europe , said : " qm2 heading to sea for the first time marks a major milestone in the construction of the greatest ocean liner ever .
it 's an exceptional boat .
i get a strong feeling looking at this cathedral that moves on the water gerard boulfray , saint-nazaire resident " we are confident qm2 will live up to expectations and we look forward to taking delivery of the vessel in december . "
the qm2 is due to sail into southampton for the first time at christmas and will be named in a lavish ceremony on 8 january 2004 .
the ship leaves the hampshire port on its maiden passenger voyage to fort lauderdale in florida four days later .
penthouse suites the massive ship , which is as tall as a 23-storey building , towers 60 metres -lrb- 200 feet -rrb- above the waterline and produces enough energy to provide electricity for a city of 300,000 residents .
it is 345 metres long and 41 metres wide - dwarfing the queen elizabeth ii , which weighs 70,000 tonnes , and the ill-fated titanic , which measured 269 metres in length .
the ship is expected to be the last word in luxury with facilities including a 1,000-seat theatre , a ballroom , five swimming pools , a spa , six restaurants , 14 bars , a disco , a library , a casino and even a planetarium .
the choice of accommodation for passengers includes duplex apartments with private gymnasiums and penthouse suites with butler service .

cunard 's 150,000-tonne queen mary 2 , whose home port will be southampton , sailed from the french port of saint-nazaire for sea trials .
the new cunard flagship cost £ 540m and will accommodate some 2,600 passengers and 1,250 crew members .
hundreds of spectators gathered on the shore to applaud the ship as it set off for four days of sailing along the french coast .
like its predecessor the queen mary , the ship will undertake a measured mile speed trial and is expected to get up to 34 mph , or 30 knots .
naming ceremony about 450 technicians and engineers are on board to assess the liner 's seaworthiness in preparation for its maiden voyage in january .
peter shanks , cunard 's senior vice-president in europe , said : " qm2 heading to sea for the first time marks a major milestone in the construction of the greatest ocean liner ever .
it 's an exceptional boat .
i get a strong feeling looking at this cathedral that moves on the water gerard boulfray , saint-nazaire resident " we are confident qm2 will live up to expectations and we look forward to taking delivery of the vessel in december . "
the qm2 is due to sail into southampton for the first time at christmas and will be named in a lavish ceremony on 8 january 2004 .
the ship leaves the hampshire port on its maiden passenger voyage to fort lauderdale in florida four days later .
penthouse suites the massive ship , which is as tall as a 23-storey building , towers 60 metres -lrb- 200 feet -rrb- above the waterline and produces enough energy to provide electricity for a city of 300,000 residents .
it is 345 metres long and 41 metres wide - dwarfing the queen elizabeth ii , which weighs 70,000 tonnes , and the ill-fated titanic , which measured 269 metres in length .
the ship is expected to be the last word in luxury with facilities including a 1,000-seat theatre , a ballroom , five swimming pools , a spa , six restaurants , 14 bars , a disco , a library , a casino and even a planetarium .
the choice of accommodation for passengers includes duplex apartments with private gymnasiums and penthouse suites with butler service .
lining the walls will be 300 works of art worth an estimated $ 3m .
needless to say , tickets for the maiden voyage to fort lauderdale , florida have prices to match - ranging from £ 2,145 for an interior cabin with no view to £ 28,500 for a duplex .

carl mccall , nyse lead director and head of the compensation committee , said he was stepping down .
mr mccall , who initially defended the $ 140m salary of ex-chief executive richard grasso , said he was leaving in order to clear the air .
his departure has been accompanied by reports that the nyse 's new chief executive wants to carry out a more sweeping review than first thought .
bigger shake-up ?
mr mccall said he was going so that john reed , the nyse 's new interim chief executive , could " move forward without being encumbered by the past " .
he said he wanted mr reed to be " free to do whatever is necessary to restore the integrity of the nyse " .
according to a report in the wall street journal , mr reed is scrapping a special board committee 's report on what lessons the grasso scandal holds for how the exchange is run .
mr mccall was leading that review .
the newspaper reports that mr reed wants a much wider review of corporate governance at the nyse , and its role as a regulator .
he is also known to want the reduce the size of the nyse 's board , which currently has 27 members .
mr mccall 's resignation has been generally praised as an honourable act .
" it 's a good thing , and it was the right thing to do , " said sarah treslik , executive director of the council of institutional investors .
" there needs to be turnover on the board and mccall , even though he did help grasso resign in the last couple of days , had been a strong supporter of his , and particularly of his pay , for a long enough period of time that as long as he stayed it was an issue , " she said .
mr reed was chairman and co-chief executive of the investment bank citigroup before his retirement in 2000 .

the services let users choose a recipient from an instant messenger-style " buddy list " on their phone screen , press a key and start talking .
the message , which can be up to 30 seconds long , comes out through the recipient 's mobile 's loudspeaker almost instantaneously .
push-to-talk has proved immensely popular in the united states , and nextel , the mobile phone operator which dominates the us push-to-talk market , has 12 million customers for its service .
in an instant last year us users sent over 62 billion push-to-talk messages , says nextel .
now a chicago-based company , fastmobile , plans to launch a push-to-talk service called fastchat in the uk .
push-to-talk systems use the " always-on " , low cost data network gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- to send messages from one mobile phone to another .
all uk mobile phone operators , as well as international operators , offer gprs for transmitting digital data .
when a person sends a message , it goes to the mobile phone company 's internet gateway .
it is then sent over the net , like an instant message , to a messaging server .
from there it is passed back over the net to the country the intended recipient is in , and finally to a mobile by gprs .
by bypassing expensive voice networks , push-to-talk messages can be sent at a similar cost to a text message , even internationally .
the quality of the voice messages is the same or better than mobile phone calls because the messages are compressed just like voice calls , but less data is " lost " .
push-to-talk is not designed as a replacement to normal phone conversations , but as a quick and convenient alternative to texts .
it does away with the bother and expense of dialling a number , according to james tagg , european managing director of fastmobile .
ease of use more than five billion text messages were sent in the first quarter of this year alone , according to figures from oftel .
many of the " meet me in the pub in 20 minutes " type of messages sent by the most active texters , 18 to 26 year olds , could be conveniently sent as push-to-talk messages , says mr tagg .
even though predictive texting , larger keypads and abbreviations have all made text messaging easier , he believes simple spoken message would be more appealing .
fastchat is also aimed at taxi and delivery companies using expensive radio systems or walkie talkies with limited range , as well as business people who need to be in constant touch with colleagues .
since the technology behind it is the same as net-based instant messaging , it is more versatile than traditional phone-based texting .
push-to-talk messages can be sent to multiple recipients , including fastchat and computer based im users .
users can also e-mail messages and attachments , like picture phone images .
the average user could expect to pay about £ 7.00 per month , with bundles of messages available from next month , but other packages would be available for business use .
conversations would also have a sliding scale of charges , so it will not end up more expensive than making a normal voice call when replies are sent back and forth .
if the success of push-to-talk services in the us is anything to go by , companies like fastmobile may soon make text messaging look positively old hat .

tell me , do n't text me the services let users choose a recipient from an instant messenger-style " buddy list " on their phone screen , press a key and start talking .
the message , which can be up to 30 seconds long , comes out through the recipient 's mobile 's loudspeaker almost instantaneously .
push-to-talk has proved immensely popular in the united states , and nextel , the mobile phone operator which dominates the us push-to-talk market , has 12 million customers for its service .
in an instant last year us users sent over 62 billion push-to-talk messages , says nextel .
now a chicago-based company , fastmobile , plans to launch a push-to-talk service called fastchat in the uk .
push-to-talk systems use the " always-on " , low cost data network gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- to send messages from one mobile phone to another .
all uk mobile phone operators , as well as international operators , offer gprs for transmitting digital data .
when a person sends a message , it goes to the mobile phone company 's internet gateway .
it is then sent over the net , like an instant message , to a messaging server .
from there it is passed back over the net to the country the intended recipient is in , and finally to a mobile by gprs .
by bypassing expensive voice networks , push-to-talk messages can be sent at a similar cost to a text message , even internationally .
the quality of the voice messages is the same or better than mobile phone calls because the messages are compressed just like voice calls , but less data is " lost " .
push-to-talk is not designed as a replacement to normal phone conversations , but as a quick and convenient alternative to texts .
it does away with the bother and expense of dialling a number , according to james tagg , european managing director of fastmobile .
ease of use more than five billion text messages were sent in the first quarter of this year alone , according to figures from oftel .
many of the " meet me in the pub in 20 minutes " type of messages sent by the most active texters , 18 to 26 year olds , could be conveniently sent as push-to-talk messages , says mr tagg .
' be here in 20 minutes ' even though predictive texting , larger keypads and abbreviations have all made text messaging easier , he believes simple spoken message would be more appealing .
fastchat is also aimed at taxi and delivery companies using expensive radio systems or walkie talkies with limited range , as well as business people who need to be in constant touch with colleagues .
since the technology behind it is the same as net-based instant messaging , it is more versatile than traditional phone-based texting .
push-to-talk messages can be sent to multiple recipients , including fastchat and computer based im users .
users can also e-mail messages and attachments , like picture phone images .
the average user could expect to pay about £ 7.00 per month , with bundles of messages available from next month , but other packages would be available for business use .
conversations would also have a sliding scale of charges , so it will not end up more expensive than making a normal voice call when replies are sent back and forth .
if the success of push-to-talk services in the us is anything to go by , companies like fastmobile may soon make text messaging look positively old hat .

push-to-talk has proved immensely popular in the united states , and nextel , the mobile phone operator which dominates the us push-to-talk market , has 12 million customers for its service .
in an instant last year us users sent over 62 billion push-to-talk messages , says nextel .
now a chicago-based company , fastmobile , plans to launch a push-to-talk service called fastchat in the uk .
push-to-talk systems use the " always-on " , low cost data network gprs -lrb- general packet radio service -rrb- to send messages from one mobile phone to another .
all uk mobile phone operators , as well as international operators , offer gprs for transmitting digital data .
when a person sends a message , it goes to the mobile phone company 's internet gateway .
it is then sent over the net , like an instant message , to a messaging server .
from there it is passed back over the net to the country the intended recipient is in , and finally to a mobile by gprs .
by bypassing expensive voice networks , push-to-talk messages can be sent at a similar cost to a text message , even internationally .
the quality of the voice messages is the same or better than mobile phone calls because the messages are compressed just like voice calls , but less data is " lost " .
push-to-talk is not designed as a replacement to normal phone conversations , but as a quick and convenient alternative to texts .
it does away with the bother and expense of dialling a number , according to james tagg , european managing director of fastmobile .
ease of use more than five billion text messages were sent in the first quarter of this year alone , according to figures from oftel .
many of the " meet me in the pub in 20 minutes " type of messages sent by the most active texters , 18 to 26 year olds , could be conveniently sent as push-to-talk messages , says mr tagg .
' be here in 20 minutes ' even though predictive texting , larger keypads and abbreviations have all made text messaging easier , he believes simple spoken message would be more appealing .
fastchat is also aimed at taxi and delivery companies using expensive radio systems or walkie talkies with limited range , as well as business people who need to be in constant touch with colleagues .
since the technology behind it is the same as net-based instant messaging , it is more versatile than traditional phone-based texting .
push-to-talk messages can be sent to multiple recipients , including fastchat and computer based im users .
users can also e-mail messages and attachments , like picture phone images .
the average user could expect to pay about £ 7.00 per month , with bundles of messages available from next month , but other packages would be available for business use .
conversations would also have a sliding scale of charges , so it will not end up more expensive than making a normal voice call when replies are sent back and forth .
if the success of push-to-talk services in the us is anything to go by , companies like fastmobile may soon make text messaging look positively old hat .

commonwealth foreign ministers , meeting in new york , greeted news of the acquittal with spontaneous applause .
thirty-one year old amina lawal was convicted last year in katsina state .
four out of five judges rejected her conviction , saying she was not given " ample opportunity to defend herself " .
she had been found guilty under sharia -lrb- islamic criminal law -rrb- which has been introduced into 12 northern states over the last three years .
" i repeatedly made clear to the nigerian government that australia regarded death by stoning as a cruel , inhumane and degrading form of punishment , " australian foreign minister alexander downer downer said in his statement .
amnesty international welcomed the ruling and called for the nigerian government to abolish the death penalty .
" amina lawal 's case should not have been brought to a court of law in the first instance , " the global rights group said in a statement .
" nobody should ever be made to go through a similar ordeal . "
countries across africa and europe also welcomed the decision .
the verdict , which had been expected says the bbc 's anna borzello in katsina , was read out to a packed courtroom in the appeal court in the northern town of katsina .
the panel of judges said the decision to acquit ms lawal was based on procedural errors at her original trial and the fact that her adultery was not proved beyond doubt .
ms lawal sat throughout the verdict in the corner of the courtroom , her face hidden by a shawl and her child on her lap .
a village woman , she had been convicted of adultery in march last year soon after giving birth to her daughter , wasila .
this was the second time she had appealed against her sentence of death by stoning , with the help of two nigeria women 's rights groups which took up her case .
while thursday 's ruling means ms lawal can go home a free woman , the issue of sharia and in particular sharia punishments like flogging for fornication and amputation for theft has not gone away , our correspondent says .
shortly after the verdict , a nigerian man was sentenced to death by stoning for sodomy after pleading guilty to sleeping with boys in northern bauchi state .
the introduction of sharia punishment has been highly controversial , provoking international concern abroad and sparking religious violence within nigeria .
