program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2003 germans save for a rainy day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans put € 162 billion in the piggy bank last year .
when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .
both countries promised more resources in the fight against what ’ s become known as " underground banking . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 29.10.2003 stolen youth : child prostitution plagues german-czech border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech authorities say the problem of child prostitution is exaggerated the united nations children 's agency says child prostitution is rising across the german border in the czech republic .
even children under the age of six are sold to german sex tourists . the children wait by supermarkets , restaurants and gas stations along the czech motorways just across the border from germany .
pimps , often parents or siblings , hand babies and small children into the cars of waiting sex tourists .
the market for sex with children is booming on the czech-german border , cathrin schauer a social worker in the border region said . " young children less than six years old are offered to the sex tourists by women , whereas the older ones are usually accompanied by men or male teenagers , " schauer said .
" but eight-year-olds come along on their own and do their own negotiations about payment and sexual practices . " schauer wrote the report for unicef on the basis of her observations over the course of several years .
it was released on tuesday in berlin . the children come from poor families , schauer explained .
their mothers are often drug addicts or prostitutes themselves .
but the kids do n't necessarily come from the border region .
pimps bring them there from throughout eastern europe .
some children , including babies , are sold to the foreign customers to serve as prostitutes in western europe . the customers come in cars with german number plates , most from nearby bavaria and saxony .
some of them drive up in luxury limousines or small vans with darkened windows .
they pay the children € 5-25 -lrb- around $ 6-30 -rrb- for sexual favors .
and the locals in the nearby towns and villages turn a blind eye . prague denounces study the czech government , however , has rejected the unicef study .
" the czech republic views child prostitution and child pornography as grievous crimes and intends to take action against it on the basis of a study prepared realistically , " prime minister vladimir spidla told the ctk news agency . " unicef 's statements do not reflect the situation , " he said . the czech authorities had no information about child street prostitution , czech police spokeswomen blanka kosinova , told ctk .
nor had the police found any evidence of child prostitution when they carried out the biggest raid in czech history three weeks ago , she said . but schauer said children usually were n't discovered during raids .
" they are n't on offer in brothels , but in supermarkets , arcades , train stations and house entrances . " " europe 's biggest brothel " prostitution is on the increase in germany , according to criminal psychologist adolf gallwitz .
some 18 percent of german men regularly pay for sex , he said .
and child prostitution is also on the rise . " we have men who have a fixation on children and also exploit them .
they come from the social mainstream and are totally inconspicuous , " gallwitz told deutsche welle .
" but we also have men who turn this into a real family event and bring their wives along . " gallwitz said the czech-german border region was " europe 's biggest brothel . " german law allows for criminal offences committed in another country to be punished by german authorities , but crimes like these are difficult to prove .
children 's rights organizations have long demanded that foreign children be taken seriously as victims and witnesses and that they are n't treated like criminals . unicef is trying to draw attention to the children 's plight with its campaign " children are not for sale ! "
it has also urged the german government to become a pioneer in the fight against child prostitution . " we can no longer stand for german sex tourists asking for children , " unicef patron christina rau , the german president 's wife , said in berlin .

the adac conducted inspections of 35 different tour buses across the country and found only 10 buses to be " good " or " very good . "
eight of the buses were found to be " inadequate " or " very inadequate . "
the remaining 17 failed to rise above the description of " sufficient . "
adac tested whether a bus ’ driver was given adequate rest time , whether buses broke speed limits , whether safety information and emergency training were adequate and other criteria that could contribute to accidents .
however , the international federation of bus tour operators accused the adac of relying on faulty test criteria and presenting a report that was " not representative of the industry as a whole . "
the organization noted that there were 100 million bus trips in the country last year . out of those trips , a total of 66 germans died in bus accidents in 2003 . more briefs 29.10.2003 -pipe- schröder mulling summit for leipzig olympic bid 29.10.2003 -pipe- protestors take tower at nuclear waste depot 29.10.2003 -pipe- oecd : germany is world ’ s internet-friendliest country 28.10.2003 -pipe- muslim school avoids closure 28.10.2003 -pipe- opposition defections boost chances for tax cut 28.10.2003 -pipe- degussa regrets exclusion from holocaust memorial 27.10.2003 -pipe- greens call on u.n.

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .
still , zeller does n't have any illusions about how quickly that process will unfold .
" in a country that has been politically centralized for 200 years , decentralization isn ’ t going to happen overnight , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de auto metaphors fly at franco-german summit leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year .

even children under the age of six are sold to german sex tourists . the children wait by supermarkets , restaurants and gas stations along the czech motorways just across the border from germany .

“ public finances are not in good shape , ” monetary affairs commissioner pedro solbes told a brussels news conference , according to bloomberg news .
designed to protect the stability of the single currency , the deficit limit rule could mean brussels might sanction berlin or paris if they do not do enough to put their budgets in order .

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .
still , zeller does n't have any illusions about how quickly that process will unfold .
" in a country that has been politically centralized for 200 years , decentralization isn ’ t going to happen overnight , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de auto metaphors fly at franco-german summit leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year .

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .
still , zeller does n't have any illusions about how quickly that process will unfold .
" in a country that has been politically centralized for 200 years , decentralization isn ’ t going to happen overnight , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de auto metaphors fly at franco-german summit leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2003 germans save for a rainy day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans put € 162 billion in the piggy bank last year .
when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you feel that you 're saving enough money for your retirement ? radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

even children under the age of six are sold to german sex tourists . the children wait by supermarkets , restaurants and gas stations along the czech motorways just across the border from germany .
pimps , often parents or siblings , hand babies and small children into the cars of waiting sex tourists .
the market for sex with children is booming on the czech-german border , cathrin schauer a social worker in the border region said . " young children less than six years old are offered to the sex tourists by women , whereas the older ones are usually accompanied by men or male teenagers , " schauer said .
" but eight-year-olds come along on their own and do their own negotiations about payment and sexual practices . " schauer wrote the report for unicef on the basis of her observations over the course of several years .
it was released on tuesday in berlin . the children come from poor families , schauer explained .
their mothers are often drug addicts or prostitutes themselves .
but the kids do n't necessarily come from the border region .
pimps bring them there from throughout eastern europe .
some children , including babies , are sold to the foreign customers to serve as prostitutes in western europe . the customers come in cars with german number plates , most from nearby bavaria and saxony .
some of them drive up in luxury limousines or small vans with darkened windows .
they pay the children € 5-25 -lrb- around $ 6-30 -rrb- for sexual favors .
and the locals in the nearby towns and villages turn a blind eye . prague denounces study the czech government , however , has rejected the unicef study .
" the czech republic views child prostitution and child pornography as grievous crimes and intends to take action against it on the basis of a study prepared realistically , " prime minister vladimir spidla told the ctk news agency . " unicef 's statements do not reflect the situation , " he said . the czech authorities had no information about child street prostitution , czech police spokeswomen blanka kosinova , told ctk .
nor had the police found any evidence of child prostitution when they carried out the biggest raid in czech history three weeks ago , she said . but schauer said children usually were n't discovered during raids .
" they are n't on offer in brothels , but in supermarkets , arcades , train stations and house entrances . " " europe 's biggest brothel " prostitution is on the increase in germany , according to criminal psychologist adolf gallwitz .
some 18 percent of german men regularly pay for sex , he said .
and child prostitution is also on the rise . " we have men who have a fixation on children and also exploit them .
they come from the social mainstream and are totally inconspicuous , " gallwitz told deutsche welle .
" but we also have men who turn this into a real family event and bring their wives along . " gallwitz said the czech-german border region was " europe 's biggest brothel . " german law allows for criminal offences committed in another country to be punished by german authorities , but crimes like these are difficult to prove .
children 's rights organizations have long demanded that foreign children be taken seriously as victims and witnesses and that they are n't treated like criminals . unicef is trying to draw attention to the children 's plight with its campaign " children are not for sale ! "
it has also urged the german government to become a pioneer in the fight against child prostitution . " we can no longer stand for german sex tourists asking for children , " unicef patron christina rau , the german president 's wife , said in berlin .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you feel that you 're saving enough money for your retirement ? radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .

the adac conducted inspections of 35 different tour buses across the country and found only 10 buses to be " good " or " very good . "
eight of the buses were found to be " inadequate " or " very inadequate . "
the remaining 17 failed to rise above the description of " sufficient . "
adac tested whether a bus ’ driver was given adequate rest time , whether buses broke speed limits , whether safety information and emergency training were adequate and other criteria that could contribute to accidents .
however , the international federation of bus tour operators accused the adac of relying on faulty test criteria and presenting a report that was " not representative of the industry as a whole . "
the organization noted that there were 100 million bus trips in the country last year . out of those trips , a total of 66 germans died in bus accidents in 2003 . more briefs 29.10.2003 -pipe- schröder mulling summit for leipzig olympic bid 29.10.2003 -pipe- protestors take tower at nuclear waste depot 29.10.2003 -pipe- oecd : germany is world ’ s internet-friendliest country 28.10.2003 -pipe- muslim school avoids closure 28.10.2003 -pipe- opposition defections boost chances for tax cut 28.10.2003 -pipe- degussa regrets exclusion from holocaust memorial 27.10.2003 -pipe- greens call on u.n.

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you feel that you 're saving enough money for your retirement ? 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .
both countries promised more resources in the fight against what ’ s become known as " underground banking . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .

using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .
still , zeller does n't have any illusions about how quickly that process will unfold .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .
both countries promised more resources in the fight against what ’ s become known as " underground banking . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .
still , zeller does n't have any illusions about how quickly that process will unfold .

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .
still , zeller does n't have any illusions about how quickly that process will unfold .
" in a country that has been politically centralized for 200 years , decentralization isn ’ t going to happen overnight , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de auto metaphors fly at franco-german summit leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .
both countries promised more resources in the fight against what ’ s become known as " underground banking . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you feel that you 're saving enough money for your retirement ? 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .
still , zeller does n't have any illusions about how quickly that process will unfold .

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you feel that you 're saving enough money for your retirement ? 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "

even children under the age of six are sold to german sex tourists . the children wait by supermarkets , restaurants and gas stations along the czech motorways just across the border from germany .
pimps , often parents or siblings , hand babies and small children into the cars of waiting sex tourists .
the market for sex with children is booming on the czech-german border , cathrin schauer a social worker in the border region said . " young children less than six years old are offered to the sex tourists by women , whereas the older ones are usually accompanied by men or male teenagers , " schauer said .
" but eight-year-olds come along on their own and do their own negotiations about payment and sexual practices . " schauer wrote the report for unicef on the basis of her observations over the course of several years .
it was released on tuesday in berlin . the children come from poor families , schauer explained .
their mothers are often drug addicts or prostitutes themselves .
but the kids do n't necessarily come from the border region .
pimps bring them there from throughout eastern europe .
some children , including babies , are sold to the foreign customers to serve as prostitutes in western europe . the customers come in cars with german number plates , most from nearby bavaria and saxony .
some of them drive up in luxury limousines or small vans with darkened windows .
they pay the children € 5-25 -lrb- around $ 6-30 -rrb- for sexual favors .
and the locals in the nearby towns and villages turn a blind eye . prague denounces study the czech government , however , has rejected the unicef study .
" the czech republic views child prostitution and child pornography as grievous crimes and intends to take action against it on the basis of a study prepared realistically , " prime minister vladimir spidla told the ctk news agency . " unicef 's statements do not reflect the situation , " he said . the czech authorities had no information about child street prostitution , czech police spokeswomen blanka kosinova , told ctk .
nor had the police found any evidence of child prostitution when they carried out the biggest raid in czech history three weeks ago , she said . but schauer said children usually were n't discovered during raids .
" they are n't on offer in brothels , but in supermarkets , arcades , train stations and house entrances . " " europe 's biggest brothel " prostitution is on the increase in germany , according to criminal psychologist adolf gallwitz .
some 18 percent of german men regularly pay for sex , he said .
and child prostitution is also on the rise . " we have men who have a fixation on children and also exploit them .
they come from the social mainstream and are totally inconspicuous , " gallwitz told deutsche welle .
" but we also have men who turn this into a real family event and bring their wives along . " gallwitz said the czech-german border region was " europe 's biggest brothel . " german law allows for criminal offences committed in another country to be punished by german authorities , but crimes like these are difficult to prove .
children 's rights organizations have long demanded that foreign children be taken seriously as victims and witnesses and that they are n't treated like criminals . unicef is trying to draw attention to the children 's plight with its campaign " children are not for sale ! "
it has also urged the german government to become a pioneer in the fight against child prostitution . " we can no longer stand for german sex tourists asking for children , " unicef patron christina rau , the german president 's wife , said in berlin .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .
both countries promised more resources in the fight against what ’ s become known as " underground banking . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you feel that you 're saving enough money for your retirement ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you feel that you 're saving enough money for your retirement ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2003 germans save for a rainy day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans put € 162 billion in the piggy bank last year .
when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .
still , zeller does n't have any illusions about how quickly that process will unfold .
" in a country that has been politically centralized for 200 years , decentralization isn ’ t going to happen overnight , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de auto metaphors fly at franco-german summit leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year .

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .

less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .
still , zeller does n't have any illusions about how quickly that process will unfold .

even children under the age of six are sold to german sex tourists . the children wait by supermarkets , restaurants and gas stations along the czech motorways just across the border from germany .
pimps , often parents or siblings , hand babies and small children into the cars of waiting sex tourists .
the market for sex with children is booming on the czech-german border , cathrin schauer a social worker in the border region said . " young children less than six years old are offered to the sex tourists by women , whereas the older ones are usually accompanied by men or male teenagers , " schauer said .
" but eight-year-olds come along on their own and do their own negotiations about payment and sexual practices . " schauer wrote the report for unicef on the basis of her observations over the course of several years .
it was released on tuesday in berlin . the children come from poor families , schauer explained .
their mothers are often drug addicts or prostitutes themselves .
but the kids do n't necessarily come from the border region .
pimps bring them there from throughout eastern europe .
some children , including babies , are sold to the foreign customers to serve as prostitutes in western europe . the customers come in cars with german number plates , most from nearby bavaria and saxony .
some of them drive up in luxury limousines or small vans with darkened windows .
they pay the children € 5-25 -lrb- around $ 6-30 -rrb- for sexual favors .
and the locals in the nearby towns and villages turn a blind eye . prague denounces study the czech government , however , has rejected the unicef study .
" the czech republic views child prostitution and child pornography as grievous crimes and intends to take action against it on the basis of a study prepared realistically , " prime minister vladimir spidla told the ctk news agency . " unicef 's statements do not reflect the situation , " he said . the czech authorities had no information about child street prostitution , czech police spokeswomen blanka kosinova , told ctk .
nor had the police found any evidence of child prostitution when they carried out the biggest raid in czech history three weeks ago , she said . but schauer said children usually were n't discovered during raids .
" they are n't on offer in brothels , but in supermarkets , arcades , train stations and house entrances . " " europe 's biggest brothel " prostitution is on the increase in germany , according to criminal psychologist adolf gallwitz .
some 18 percent of german men regularly pay for sex , he said .
and child prostitution is also on the rise . " we have men who have a fixation on children and also exploit them .
they come from the social mainstream and are totally inconspicuous , " gallwitz told deutsche welle .
" but we also have men who turn this into a real family event and bring their wives along . " gallwitz said the czech-german border region was " europe 's biggest brothel . " german law allows for criminal offences committed in another country to be punished by german authorities , but crimes like these are difficult to prove .
children 's rights organizations have long demanded that foreign children be taken seriously as victims and witnesses and that they are n't treated like criminals . unicef is trying to draw attention to the children 's plight with its campaign " children are not for sale ! "
it has also urged the german government to become a pioneer in the fight against child prostitution . " we can no longer stand for german sex tourists asking for children , " unicef patron christina rau , the german president 's wife , said in berlin .

even children under the age of six are sold to german sex tourists . the children wait by supermarkets , restaurants and gas stations along the czech motorways just across the border from germany .
pimps , often parents or siblings , hand babies and small children into the cars of waiting sex tourists .
the market for sex with children is booming on the czech-german border , cathrin schauer a social worker in the border region said . " young children less than six years old are offered to the sex tourists by women , whereas the older ones are usually accompanied by men or male teenagers , " schauer said .
" but eight-year-olds come along on their own and do their own negotiations about payment and sexual practices . " schauer wrote the report for unicef on the basis of her observations over the course of several years .
it was released on tuesday in berlin . the children come from poor families , schauer explained .
their mothers are often drug addicts or prostitutes themselves .
but the kids do n't necessarily come from the border region .
pimps bring them there from throughout eastern europe .
some children , including babies , are sold to the foreign customers to serve as prostitutes in western europe . the customers come in cars with german number plates , most from nearby bavaria and saxony .
some of them drive up in luxury limousines or small vans with darkened windows .
they pay the children € 5-25 -lrb- around $ 6-30 -rrb- for sexual favors .
and the locals in the nearby towns and villages turn a blind eye . prague denounces study the czech government , however , has rejected the unicef study .
" the czech republic views child prostitution and child pornography as grievous crimes and intends to take action against it on the basis of a study prepared realistically , " prime minister vladimir spidla told the ctk news agency . " unicef 's statements do not reflect the situation , " he said . the czech authorities had no information about child street prostitution , czech police spokeswomen blanka kosinova , told ctk .
nor had the police found any evidence of child prostitution when they carried out the biggest raid in czech history three weeks ago , she said . but schauer said children usually were n't discovered during raids .
" they are n't on offer in brothels , but in supermarkets , arcades , train stations and house entrances . " " europe 's biggest brothel " prostitution is on the increase in germany , according to criminal psychologist adolf gallwitz .
some 18 percent of german men regularly pay for sex , he said .
and child prostitution is also on the rise . " we have men who have a fixation on children and also exploit them .
they come from the social mainstream and are totally inconspicuous , " gallwitz told deutsche welle .
" but we also have men who turn this into a real family event and bring their wives along . " gallwitz said the czech-german border region was " europe 's biggest brothel . " german law allows for criminal offences committed in another country to be punished by german authorities , but crimes like these are difficult to prove .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you feel that you 're saving enough money for your retirement ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .
both countries promised more resources in the fight against what ’ s become known as " underground banking . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

even children under the age of six are sold to german sex tourists . the children wait by supermarkets , restaurants and gas stations along the czech motorways just across the border from germany .
pimps , often parents or siblings , hand babies and small children into the cars of waiting sex tourists .
the market for sex with children is booming on the czech-german border , cathrin schauer a social worker in the border region said . " young children less than six years old are offered to the sex tourists by women , whereas the older ones are usually accompanied by men or male teenagers , " schauer said .
" but eight-year-olds come along on their own and do their own negotiations about payment and sexual practices . " schauer wrote the report for unicef on the basis of her observations over the course of several years .
it was released on tuesday in berlin . the children come from poor families , schauer explained .
their mothers are often drug addicts or prostitutes themselves .
but the kids do n't necessarily come from the border region .
pimps bring them there from throughout eastern europe .
some children , including babies , are sold to the foreign customers to serve as prostitutes in western europe . the customers come in cars with german number plates , most from nearby bavaria and saxony .
some of them drive up in luxury limousines or small vans with darkened windows .
they pay the children € 5-25 -lrb- around $ 6-30 -rrb- for sexual favors .
and the locals in the nearby towns and villages turn a blind eye . prague denounces study the czech government , however , has rejected the unicef study .
" the czech republic views child prostitution and child pornography as grievous crimes and intends to take action against it on the basis of a study prepared realistically , " prime minister vladimir spidla told the ctk news agency . " unicef 's statements do not reflect the situation , " he said . the czech authorities had no information about child street prostitution , czech police spokeswomen blanka kosinova , told ctk .
nor had the police found any evidence of child prostitution when they carried out the biggest raid in czech history three weeks ago , she said . but schauer said children usually were n't discovered during raids .
" they are n't on offer in brothels , but in supermarkets , arcades , train stations and house entrances . " " europe 's biggest brothel " prostitution is on the increase in germany , according to criminal psychologist adolf gallwitz .
some 18 percent of german men regularly pay for sex , he said .
and child prostitution is also on the rise . " we have men who have a fixation on children and also exploit them .
they come from the social mainstream and are totally inconspicuous , " gallwitz told deutsche welle .
" but we also have men who turn this into a real family event and bring their wives along . " gallwitz said the czech-german border region was " europe 's biggest brothel . " german law allows for criminal offences committed in another country to be punished by german authorities , but crimes like these are difficult to prove .
children 's rights organizations have long demanded that foreign children be taken seriously as victims and witnesses and that they are n't treated like criminals . unicef is trying to draw attention to the children 's plight with its campaign " children are not for sale ! "
it has also urged the german government to become a pioneer in the fight against child prostitution . " we can no longer stand for german sex tourists asking for children , " unicef patron christina rau , the german president 's wife , said in berlin .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .
both countries promised more resources in the fight against what ’ s become known as " underground banking . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

even children under the age of six are sold to german sex tourists . the children wait by supermarkets , restaurants and gas stations along the czech motorways just across the border from germany .
pimps , often parents or siblings , hand babies and small children into the cars of waiting sex tourists .
the market for sex with children is booming on the czech-german border , cathrin schauer a social worker in the border region said . " young children less than six years old are offered to the sex tourists by women , whereas the older ones are usually accompanied by men or male teenagers , " schauer said .
" but eight-year-olds come along on their own and do their own negotiations about payment and sexual practices . " schauer wrote the report for unicef on the basis of her observations over the course of several years .
it was released on tuesday in berlin . the children come from poor families , schauer explained .
their mothers are often drug addicts or prostitutes themselves .
but the kids do n't necessarily come from the border region .
pimps bring them there from throughout eastern europe .
some children , including babies , are sold to the foreign customers to serve as prostitutes in western europe . the customers come in cars with german number plates , most from nearby bavaria and saxony .
some of them drive up in luxury limousines or small vans with darkened windows .
they pay the children € 5-25 -lrb- around $ 6-30 -rrb- for sexual favors .
and the locals in the nearby towns and villages turn a blind eye . prague denounces study the czech government , however , has rejected the unicef study .
" the czech republic views child prostitution and child pornography as grievous crimes and intends to take action against it on the basis of a study prepared realistically , " prime minister vladimir spidla told the ctk news agency . " unicef 's statements do not reflect the situation , " he said . the czech authorities had no information about child street prostitution , czech police spokeswomen blanka kosinova , told ctk .
nor had the police found any evidence of child prostitution when they carried out the biggest raid in czech history three weeks ago , she said . but schauer said children usually were n't discovered during raids .
" they are n't on offer in brothels , but in supermarkets , arcades , train stations and house entrances . " " europe 's biggest brothel " prostitution is on the increase in germany , according to criminal psychologist adolf gallwitz .
some 18 percent of german men regularly pay for sex , he said .
and child prostitution is also on the rise . " we have men who have a fixation on children and also exploit them .
they come from the social mainstream and are totally inconspicuous , " gallwitz told deutsche welle .
" but we also have men who turn this into a real family event and bring their wives along . " gallwitz said the czech-german border region was " europe 's biggest brothel . " german law allows for criminal offences committed in another country to be punished by german authorities , but crimes like these are difficult to prove .
children 's rights organizations have long demanded that foreign children be taken seriously as victims and witnesses and that they are n't treated like criminals . unicef is trying to draw attention to the children 's plight with its campaign " children are not for sale ! "

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .

besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 29.10.2003 germans save for a rainy day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans put € 162 billion in the piggy bank last year .
when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you feel that you 're saving enough money for your retirement ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .
both countries promised more resources in the fight against what ’ s become known as " underground banking . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

even children under the age of six are sold to german sex tourists . the children wait by supermarkets , restaurants and gas stations along the czech motorways just across the border from germany .
pimps , often parents or siblings , hand babies and small children into the cars of waiting sex tourists .
the market for sex with children is booming on the czech-german border , cathrin schauer a social worker in the border region said . " young children less than six years old are offered to the sex tourists by women , whereas the older ones are usually accompanied by men or male teenagers , " schauer said .
" but eight-year-olds come along on their own and do their own negotiations about payment and sexual practices . " schauer wrote the report for unicef on the basis of her observations over the course of several years .
it was released on tuesday in berlin . the children come from poor families , schauer explained .
their mothers are often drug addicts or prostitutes themselves .
but the kids do n't necessarily come from the border region .
pimps bring them there from throughout eastern europe .
some children , including babies , are sold to the foreign customers to serve as prostitutes in western europe . the customers come in cars with german number plates , most from nearby bavaria and saxony .
some of them drive up in luxury limousines or small vans with darkened windows .
they pay the children € 5-25 -lrb- around $ 6-30 -rrb- for sexual favors .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .

when it comes to saving , germany is a model nation .
on average , germans set aside 10.5 percent of their available income . some are saving up for a house , a new car or an expensive vacation .
others are keeping the piggy bank stocked out of fear of job loss or worries over a lengthy illness .
the motives may vary , but the effect is the same : germans are saving more money than ever before .
a recent study in conjunction with the world savings day on oct .
30 shows that the average german puts aside 10.5 percent of income for a rainy day .
that 's a 4.5 percent increase in savings from the previous year .
in real terms that equates to about € 162 billion .
but compared to years past , germans are not primarily saving up for future purchases , but rather because they are uncertain about the ability of the state 's social system to support them in old age .
according to dietrich hoppenstedt , president of germany 's sparkassen savings banks , the trend of saving more can be at least partially explained by the news about the looming pensions crisis .
" people in germany have understood what the situation is , " he says .
" they know that they have to take on the responsibility of planning for their future financial security .
and they 've understood that they ca n't count on the state pension system if they want to maintain their standard of living . "
wary of stock market economic experts also attribute the trend towards greater savings to negative experiences resulting from stock market investments .
many first time investors who lost money on much-hyped flops such as the deutsche telekom privatization , seem to live up to the proverb " once bitten , twice shy . "
cautious consumers are keeping their hands off the stock market , preferring the safety of an old-fashioned savings account .
thomas fusshöller , chief economist of postbank -lrb- savings bank associated with the german post -rrb- says germans are also saving out of a general sense of insecurity due to the overall economic downturn .
" people 's disposable income barely increased in the past year , nor has it increased much in the current year .
net incomes have even gone down .
the caution that people are exhibiting is understandable , especially if you add to that the back and forth over taxes , subsidies , and the reform of the social system - of course that heightens insecurities . "
despite this , fusshöller is optimistic that consumer spending will increase in 2004 .
" the planned tax breaks should add to incomes , and i think then we 'll see more people spending money again . "
saving across the board germans also set themselves apart from their eu counterparts in saving across all age levels , with people in their 40 's and 50 's typically saving the most .
in contrast , britain 's national consumer council -lrb- ncc -rrb- reports that young adults in the uk are too concerned with the cost of living to save for their retirement .
a survey by the ncc showed that only one in three people under 30 are setting money aside for their retirement , and that 55 percent of people in all age groups felt they were not saving enough for old age .
and looking further afield , even japan 's famously high savings rate has dropped below that of france and germany , and is in danger now of falling close to the low rate typically seen in the united states .
in the past , many japanese had a higher savings rate than their western counterparts , but unemployment and wage cuts mean there 's now less money to put aside .
mentality matters and while the same can be said for germany , the difference it seems , is in the mentality .
in japan , saving money is seen as a virtue , but one that can be sacrificed when economic times get tough .
in germany , it 's conservatism and pessimism that drive savings - feelings that are only reinforced when the chips are down . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback do you feel that you 're saving enough money for your retirement ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .
both countries promised more resources in the fight against what ’ s become known as " underground banking . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .

using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .
still , zeller does n't have any illusions about how quickly that process will unfold .

as the highly centralized french political system seeks to move influence from paris to the regions , strasbourg and the alsace are emerging as models for the success decentralization can bring . once at the center of the german-french tug-of-war for the alsace-lorraine region , strasbourg these days has a lot going for it .
besides being home to the european parliament and the european court of justice , it now shares a peaceful and prosperous border with germany , which has long influenced its culture and history .
it also has some of the best cuisine in europe .
less known , however , is that it 's at the center of one of the most dramatic shifts in modern french political history : the decentralization of power from paris to the regional level .
for seven years adrian zeller , the 63-year-old longtime mayor of the city of saverne , has also served as president of the alsatian regional council , a role similar to that of premier or governor .
he 's also a leading champion of devolving decision-making .
" france has a very strong centralized culture , in which ministers , intellectual circles and so on all believe that ideas come from paris and that the provinces are somewhat backward , " zeller told german public broadcaster swr .
" we really have to fight against this culture and say : promote the regions , that ’ s modern . "
federalism vs. centralism france ’ s centralized political culture differs greatly from germany ’ s system of federalism , which splits competencies between berlin and 16 federal states .
in france , most decisions are taken by the federal government in paris .
but that 's slowly changing .
the first major wave of decentralization came in 1982 , when then-president francois mitterand launched the process of administrative decentralization , creating 22 regional governments with very limited powers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin but it got a second boost last spring when french prime minister jean-pierre raffarin pushed through a constitutional amendment opening the door for greater regional authority over environmental and preservation policy , regional construction and infrastructure , tourism , education , health and economic development .
using that newfound authority to forge greater ties between the french regions and german states dominated the agenda of a franco-german summit organized by raffarin earlier this week .
the alsatian model for more than five years now , paris has used the strategically well-positioned alsace , with its common border with germany and switzerland , as a laboratory for its experiments in decentralization .
in 1997 , paris transferred responsibility for regional railways in the area to the alsatian government .
in the six years since , new lines , trains and schedules have been added and passenger numbers are up 35 percent .
following this week ’ s summit , new emphasis is being placed on the cross-border upper rhine area .
berlin and paris have pledged to declare the strasbourg metropolitan area and neighboring offenburg in the german state of baden-württemburg as a “ euro district ” , the first-ever cross-border regional authority in europe .
but officials haven ’ t yet laid out any concrete proposals for what the region ’ s responsibilities might be .
the countries ’ differing political structures could also stand in the way .
" the problem with the euro district is that , though we want to be able to do a lot on the communal level , responsibilities for a number of areas are split between the state and federal level , " said günter petry , mayor of the nearby german city kehl .
he noted that in germany language and education issues are regulated by the state and both the federal and state government are responsible for security .
in france , paris is still responsible for most regional decision-making .
" that ’ s why we would still need two separate governments , " he said .
france 's regional politicians , like alsace 's zeller , say that greater ties between french and german regions will be difficult unless further decentralization occurs .
still , zeller does n't have any illusions about how quickly that process will unfold .
" in a country that has been politically centralized for 200 years , decentralization isn ’ t going to happen overnight , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de auto metaphors fly at franco-german summit leaders seek to rev up ties beyond berlin and paris to spur economic growth and reduce the countries ’ deficit spending , which is on track to violate eu limits for the third straight year .

the united states and germany on wednesday pledged to intensify their cooperation to introduce a standardized passport system with integrated biometrical features . passports with newly integrated biometrical security features such as fingerprints and facial scans are something that both the german government and the u.s. government have been pushing for now for quite a long time .
they share the conviction that such enhanced documents can contribute towards checking migration flows more effectively and flushing out terrorist elements .
but it ’ s understood that only a unified passport system worldwide would have the desired long-term effect .
however , the prospect of including biometrical features in passports raises the hackles of those who fear a violation of national data protection laws .
at their meeting in berlin on wednesday , u.s. homeland security secretary tom ridge and german interior minister otto schily promised that transatlantic endeavors to introduce the new passport system would not run afoul of germany ’ s restrictive data protection laws .
but ridge added there was no more time to waste in agreeing on a common security standard .
" america does not seek a double standard , we look for a single international standard , " ridge said at wednesday ’ s meeting . " the -lrb- interior -rrb- minister and i feel very strongly that if a united states-european standard can be developed with regard to information sharing ... the kind of biometrics that sovereign countries and regional organizations feel is important for their security ... then that will pave the way for international agreements . "
schily supported his colleague , saying that a unified passport system would also accelerate customs procedures , which would benefit all travelers .
" if countries were to apply different security standards , then this would cause a lot of confusion for both customs officials and travelers , " the interior minister said .
" this is why a global standardization process is both desirable and necessary .
someone ’ s got to take the lead in this field and the united states and the european union are prepared to get things moving .
i ’ m sure that if everything works out alright , other nations will follow our example . "
touching on one of the more sensitive issues in current transatlantic relations , ridge also expressed his dismay at european opposition to providing detailed information on passenger lists to intelligence agencies .
" we talked about an ongoing discussion we ’ re having with the european union about passenger name record with a goal toward a satisfactory mutual resolution , " he said .
" we made progress in those discussions .
the minister is part of a five-country initiative to bring some harmony within the eu " on the issue .
schily and ridge also admitted that efforts still need to be intensified to freeze the financial assets of known or potential terrorists .

the star of bbc 's bargain hunt - who was himself adopted as a child - is backing an appeal by the agency adoption matters .
the organisation revealed on wednesday that dickinson - whose cabaret singer wife lorne lesley comes from tiger bay in cardiff - has agreed to help spread the message during national adoption week , which starts next week .
representatives of the agency will be on hand at a mobile unit at broughton retail park in flintshire , on friday and saturday , and other venues are lined up for later in the week .
adoption matters is a specialist voluntary agency with offices in chester and hale , and exists solely to provide adoption support .
since 1955 , the agency has found new families for more than 2,500 children .
adoption facts there were 5,131 adoptions in wales and england last year , up 328 on 2001 average time between care entry and adoption is 2 years 10 months average age at adoption is 4 years , 4 months adoptions in wales and england fell from 21,500 in 1971 to just under 6,000 in 2001 unmarried and gay people can adopt , but only married couples can adopt as a couple the agency wants more people from cheshire , manchester , and north east wales , to consider adopting some of the 3,000 children currently in care in the uk .
adoption is an issue close to the heart of the cheshire presenter .
he was told at the age of 12 that he had been adopted .
" i was lucky enough to be adopted into a very caring family while i was still a baby , but it 's a very different experience for many other children , " he said .
" there are very few babies these days who need adoptive families .
many of the children who are currently in care across the uk are older children aged from four , and there are brothers and sisters who need to stay together .
" there is also a large number of children with learning or physical disabilities .
it 's this group that has been waiting the longest , often years , for the opportunity of a fresh start with a new family . "
unmarried and gay people can adopt but only married couples can adopt as a couple .
earlier this year it was revealed that just 30 children had been successfully adopted through the government 's new adoption register , a report reveals .
ministers set up the register last year to match prospective parents with children who have been put up for adoption .
the move was designed to boost the number of children who are adopted in england and wales each year .
but figures published in the register 's annual report showed that while 600 matches were identified over the past year , just 30 children were adopted as a result .
the government pledged in 2000 to increase the number of children who are adopted by 40 % within five years .

safeway said underlying pre-tax profits would be around £ 173m for the first-half , down from £ 187m a year earlier .
the news came as the grocer reported a modest rise in second quarter underlying sales , boosted by a cut back on costly price reductions .
safeway said like-for-like sales were up 0.7 % in the 16 weeks to october 11 , from a 0.6 % drop in the first quarter .
chief executive carlos criado-perez supermarket hailed a " stable " performance in the face of uncertainty over its future , as the 10-month takeover saga nears its climax .
' stable trading ' he said : " our people have risen brilliantly to the challenge of serving our 10 million customers in very testing circumstances .
" safeway has delivered stable trading , solid results and strong cash generation . "
in september the chain saw bids from tesco , asda and sainsbury 's blocked after a lengthy competition probe .
a government ruling blocked approaches from the " big three " , and left the way clear for bradford-based wm morrison and retail entrepreneur philip green to submit bids for the chain .
however , trade & industry secretary patricia hewitt said morrison would have to sell off 53 of safeway 's 479-strong chain of supermarkets if its takeover attempt was successful .

for the region 's land-locked french speaking countries , ivory coast was always the natural hub for regional trade .
ivory coast was and remains the largest french speaking economy in the region with the best infrastructure and the biggest port .
but ivory coast 's first ever coup d 'etat in december 1999 marked the beginning of a period of instability never before known in the country .
the attempted coup d 'etat that followed in september 2002 has left the country divided .
ivory coast 's continuing crisis has lead many traders to look for other options .
ghana 's port gains when the crisis in ivory coast broke in september 2002 , ghana 's main port at tema was inundated with diverted ships looking for somewhere to offload their wares .
rice is sent to neighbouring mali one year on , business at tema port is still booming , and what 's more , the number of ships using tema is continuing to rise .
jacob k adorkor , the operations manager of tema port , says that more goods are coming through tema each month , especially transit goods .
these , says mr adorkor , are more often than not trade that would formerly have gone through neighbouring ivory coast for consumption or sale in the landlocked countries to the north - burkina faso , mali or niger .
the containers are typically packed with rice , sugar , flour and cooking oil .
manufactured goods are also imported , especially vehicles and machinery .
investment boost tema is just one of several ports in the region to have benefited from ivory coast 's misfortune .
ports in togo and senegal are also recording increased economic activity .
japanese money has been promised for a programme to develop and extend tema port .
the multi-million dollar project will reclaim land to construct three new container terminals , along with six new berths .
however , the project is not due to begin until 2005 , and even when completed , tema will remain a junior brother to the abidjan port in neighbouring ivory coast .
abidjan has berthing space for 70 ships , whereas tema , even after the development will only have berths for 17 ships .
if ghana wants to seriously compete with ivory coast , then capacity needs to be increased much further .
but will it last ?
henry lartey , a ghanaian businessman who exports organic papaya and pineapple to europe , says tema still falls way behind abidjan port when it comes to cost and efficiency and that its boom time could be short lived .
truck journeys can be dangerous - and expensive most importantly for him , as an exporter of a perishable product , is the timescale involved .
tema can only offer him a 16-day arrival guarantee , but his pineapples need to be in europe 's supermarkets no less than 12 days after being packed and ready to go .
henry hopes that one day soon , things may change at tema , but he 's not too hopeful .
instead he 's decided to bite the bullet and export his goods by airfreight .
it 's expensive , but it 's the only way to get his fruits to supermarket while they 're fresh .
transport problems there are problems for importers too .
much of the new trade at tema is heading north to ghana 's landlocked neighbours .
but the roads are not of the same standard in ghana as in neighbouring ivory coast .
as for the rail network , that 's practically non-existent .
this means delays for importers on the road .
the port gets congested too , as goods have to wait for lorries to return from the long trip north to collect their next load .
the government wants to develop the rail network to enable the smooth transit of goods so that ghana can become the new trade hub for west africa .
but after nearly 50 years of non-investment , it could take some time for ghana railways to meet the needed capacity .
truck drivers ' tale meanwhile , mohammed , a truck driver who has ploughed the roads between burkina faso and tema port for more years than he cares to remember , says the problems in ivory coast outweigh the benefits .
as he is stopped at a police barrier in northern ghana , he explains quietly in french , that the " costs on the road " in ghana are a fraction of those in ivory coast - meaning the fees accumulated in bribes and unofficial payments .
in ivory coast it typically costs us $ 400 in such transactions to get a single lorry load through the country .

for the region 's land-locked french speaking countries , ivory coast was always the natural hub for regional trade .
ivory coast was and remains the largest french speaking economy in the region with the best infrastructure and the biggest port .
but ivory coast 's first ever coup d 'etat in december 1999 marked the beginning of a period of instability never before known in the country .
the attempted coup d 'etat that followed in september 2002 has left the country divided .
ivory coast 's continuing crisis has lead many traders to look for other options .
ghana 's port gains when the crisis in ivory coast broke in september 2002 , ghana 's main port at tema was inundated with diverted ships looking for somewhere to offload their wares .
rice is sent to neighbouring mali one year on , business at tema port is still booming , and what 's more , the number of ships using tema is continuing to rise .
jacob k adorkor , the operations manager of tema port , says that more goods are coming through tema each month , especially transit goods .
these , says mr adorkor , are more often than not trade that would formerly have gone through neighbouring ivory coast for consumption or sale in the landlocked countries to the north - burkina faso , mali or niger .
the containers are typically packed with rice , sugar , flour and cooking oil .
manufactured goods are also imported , especially vehicles and machinery .
investment boost tema is just one of several ports in the region to have benefited from ivory coast 's misfortune .
ports in togo and senegal are also recording increased economic activity .
japanese money has been promised for a programme to develop and extend tema port .
the multi-million dollar project will reclaim land to construct three new container terminals , along with six new berths .
however , the project is not due to begin until 2005 , and even when completed , tema will remain a junior brother to the abidjan port in neighbouring ivory coast .
abidjan has berthing space for 70 ships , whereas tema , even after the development will only have berths for 17 ships .
if ghana wants to seriously compete with ivory coast , then capacity needs to be increased much further .
but will it last ?
henry lartey , a ghanaian businessman who exports organic papaya and pineapple to europe , says tema still falls way behind abidjan port when it comes to cost and efficiency and that its boom time could be short lived .
truck journeys can be dangerous - and expensive most importantly for him , as an exporter of a perishable product , is the timescale involved .
tema can only offer him a 16-day arrival guarantee , but his pineapples need to be in europe 's supermarkets no less than 12 days after being packed and ready to go .
henry hopes that one day soon , things may change at tema , but he 's not too hopeful .
instead he 's decided to bite the bullet and export his goods by airfreight .
it 's expensive , but it 's the only way to get his fruits to supermarket while they 're fresh .
transport problems there are problems for importers too .
much of the new trade at tema is heading north to ghana 's landlocked neighbours .
but the roads are not of the same standard in ghana as in neighbouring ivory coast .
as for the rail network , that 's practically non-existent .
this means delays for importers on the road .
the port gets congested too , as goods have to wait for lorries to return from the long trip north to collect their next load .
the government wants to develop the rail network to enable the smooth transit of goods so that ghana can become the new trade hub for west africa .
but after nearly 50 years of non-investment , it could take some time for ghana railways to meet the needed capacity .
truck drivers ' tale meanwhile , mohammed , a truck driver who has ploughed the roads between burkina faso and tema port for more years than he cares to remember , says the problems in ivory coast outweigh the benefits .
as he is stopped at a police barrier in northern ghana , he explains quietly in french , that the " costs on the road " in ghana are a fraction of those in ivory coast - meaning the fees accumulated in bribes and unofficial payments .
in ivory coast it typically costs us $ 400 in such transactions to get a single lorry load through the country .
according to mohammed , " the police have always been greedy in ivory coast , but these days with the crisis , things are even worse " .
potholes or no potholes , he 'll stick with ghana .

scottish natural heritage -lrb- snh -rrb- caught and killed 66 animals on north uist over the summer as part of efforts to protect ground-nesting birds .
it was criticised for its policy by animal welfare groups , who rescued 140 hedgehogs to be transferred to the mainland .
campaigner ross minett , of advocates for animals , said he was " absolutely astonished " by the new survey 's findings .
snh spokesman george anderson admitted he was " slightly surprised " .
the study on public attitudes to wildlife management was carried out by the scottish economic policy network , based in scotland 's 12 universities .
garden pests it also suggested that many people would be willing to pay for reintroducing the beaver to scotland and saving the capercaillie .
snh sparked controversy when it announced its plans to cull up hedgehogs in the western isles .
the hedgehog population on the western isles has grown to 5,000 since a handful were introduced 30 years ago to keep down garden pests .
scientific evidence suggested that the animals pose a threat to ground-nesting birds by eating their eggs . "
they realised that it has to be done , that it is being done for a good cause " dr douglas mcmillan aberdeen university more than 75 % of those questioned in the new research favoured the humane culling of mink and hedgehogs in the western isles , while only 18 % supported returning hedgehogs to the mainland .
only 80 people were questioned but researchers said it was an in-depth exercise with a good cross-section of people .
dr douglas mcmillan , who is based at aberdeen university , said people were pragmatic about the need for a cull .
" they realised that it has to be done , that it is being done for a good cause .
" if it is done properly , humanely and with good scientific reasoning then they feel that these exercises are well worth doing , " he said . "
these findings seem to go against everything that we would expect and everything that we experienced " ross minett advocates for animals reacting to the findings , mr anderson said : " i think we were slightly surprised but i think a lot of people did assume that the world was against us on this .
" we never thought that .
we did not take the decision for popularity reasons , we took the decision because it was right . "
however , mr minett said : " these findings seem to go against everything that we would expect and everything that we experienced , the tremendous public support that we found for our proposals to relocate the hedgehogs back on the mainland . "
he thought that a lot of the public perception had been " biased " by claims that it would be cruel to move the animals .
the majority of those questioned in the survey also said that they wanted to see the return of the beaver .
on average , each household was prepared to pay £ 24 a year for the next decade to fund such a project .
saving the capercaillie proved the most popular conservation project .

scottish natural heritage -lrb- snh -rrb- caught and killed 66 animals on north uist over the summer as part of efforts to protect ground-nesting birds .
it was criticised for its policy by animal welfare groups , who rescued 140 hedgehogs to be transferred to the mainland .
campaigner ross minett , of advocates for animals , said he was " absolutely astonished " by the new survey 's findings .
snh spokesman george anderson admitted he was " slightly surprised " .
the study on public attitudes to wildlife management was carried out by the scottish economic policy network , based in scotland 's 12 universities .
garden pests it also suggested that many people would be willing to pay for reintroducing the beaver to scotland and saving the capercaillie .
snh sparked controversy when it announced its plans to cull up hedgehogs in the western isles .
the hedgehog population on the western isles has grown to 5,000 since a handful were introduced 30 years ago to keep down garden pests .
scientific evidence suggested that the animals pose a threat to ground-nesting birds by eating their eggs .
they realised that it has to be done , that it is being done for a good cause dr douglas mcmillan aberdeen university more than 75 % of those questioned in the new research favoured the humane culling of mink and hedgehogs in the western isles , while only 18 % supported returning hedgehogs to the mainland .
only 80 people were questioned but researchers said it was an in-depth exercise with a good cross-section of people .
dr douglas mcmillan , who is based at aberdeen university , said people were pragmatic about the need for a cull .
" they realised that it has to be done , that it is being done for a good cause .
" if it is done properly , humanely and with good scientific reasoning then they feel that these exercises are well worth doing , " he said .
these findings seem to go against everything that we would expect and everything that we experienced ross minett advocates for animals reacting to the findings , mr anderson said : " i think we were slightly surprised but i think a lot of people did assume that the world was against us on this .
" we never thought that .
we did not take the decision for popularity reasons , we took the decision because it was right . "
however , mr minett said : " these findings seem to go against everything that we would expect and everything that we experienced , the tremendous public support that we found for our proposals to relocate the hedgehogs back on the mainland . "
he thought that a lot of the public perception had been " biased " by claims that it would be cruel to move the animals .
the majority of those questioned in the survey also said that they wanted to see the return of the beaver .
on average , each household was prepared to pay £ 24 a year for the next decade to fund such a project .
saving the capercaillie proved the most popular conservation project .

snh sparked controversy when it announced its plans to cull up hedgehogs in the western isles .
the hedgehog population on the western isles has grown to 5,000 since a handful were introduced 30 years ago to keep down garden pests .

five years ago , a bbc survey found that two-thirds of scots thought their economy would improve through devolution .
it seems they were wrong .
as the overall uk economy has borne up well under the hammer blows of the past few years , scotland has fallen rapidly behind .
now , scottish growth is close to zero , while the uk as a whole is expanding by almost 2 % .
devolution has , many say , been a political triumph - can the same be said for the economy ?
ups and downs scotland 's economy is poised in a rather complicated situation .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank in the first quarter and edged up in the second , but some feel a recovery of sorts may already have begun .
the scottish chambers ' business survey , a regular measure of commercial confidence , has pointed to a likely upturn before the end of the year .
scotland is a serial underperformer jeremy peat , royal bank of scotland and the royal bank of scotland 's purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- , arguably the most closely-watched indicator of scottish business activity , has turned in an unexpectedly strong performance for the third quarter .
but scotland 's main pmi figure remains by far the lowest in the uk and cbi scotland 's latest manufacturing survey showed that october was the weakest month in a year-and-a-half - and that the percentage of scottish firms working below capacity was the highest in 11 years .
' serial underperformer ' whatever the precise definition of scotland 's current predicament , a predicament it certainly is .
" scotland is a serial underperformer , " says jeremy peat , royal bank of scotland 's chief economist .
jim wallace says government is starting to understand business growth has lagged the uk average for five years ; in broader measures , notably quality-of-life scores such as healthcare , scotland has been behind for far longer than that .
the present malaise is the result of the scotland 's phenomenal success in attracting hi-tech manufacturing investment during the 1990s .
" silicon glen " - a term no-one seems to use any more - seems to have contracted by about one-third last year alone , provoking the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the industrialised glasgow-edinburgh corridor .
and while scottish enterprise , the agency that looks after business north of the border , claims that inward investment has steadied this year , the longer-term trend is dismal .
shrinking slice in the early 1990s , scotland accounted for close to one-fifth of total uk inward investment ; now , it garners less than 7 % .
" the cake is getting smaller , and scotland 's share of that cake is shrinking , " admits jim wallace , minister for enterprise .
where big foreign investors such as motorola and ibm have retrenched , local business has failed to fill the gap .
some critics now point to a debilitating lack of commercial dynamism in scotland , the country which arguably did more than any other to define entrepreneurial capitalism .
critics lay the blame at the door of the scottish executive , which is accused of simultaneously featherbedding scots through lavish grants and welfare payments , and battering companies with increased bureaucracy and higher business costs .
exchanges over rates the debate over whether scotland 's business environment really has deteriorated is fierce , and still unresolved .
devolved scotland has little fiscal leeway , but critics say the executive has unfairly ramped up business rates - which are now some 9 % higher than in england and wales .
mr wallace points out that the scottish business tax burden is " just under the european average - better than france , and about the same as germany " .
but cbi scotland director iain mcmillan argues : " we must remember that scottish firms operate against a skills and transport infrastructure deficit -lsb- compared with other eu countries -rsb- .
our business tax system should be compensating for this .
it is not . "
at the scottish chambers of commerce , deputy director warrick malcolm is wary about blaming devolved government for worsening business conditions .
" but we are looking forward to seeing evidence that the -lsb- edinburgh -rsb- government understands how to help business , " he says .
" it 's slim pickings so far . "
home-grown hopes to be fair , scotland 's five-year-old government has now made the economy - belatedly , say many - one of its top priorities .
after a frosty first couple of years , mr wallace and his colleagues now claim a much cosier relationship with the business community .
scotland is an expensive country to run their big idea - the somewhat irritatingly-named " smart , successful scotland " programme - aims to make the country a fertile breeding-ground for hip , high-value indigenous businesses .
smart , successful scotland urges progress towards a range of macroeconomic and productivity targets , as well as improving innovation , use of technology and quality of life .
and modest progress is indeed being made , according to an audit of the programme carried out earlier this year by the fraser of allander institute at strathclyde university , which carries out research on the scottish economy , " the essential ingredients seem to be in place , " says brian ashcroft , the institute 's director .
population problems but it 's much too early to cheer , critics warn .
smart , successful scotland is failing in one glaring regard - attracting people to work in scotland , and persuading scots to stay put .
emigration is not the flood it once was , but it is still worrying , especially among the aspirational young .
and the birth rate has fallen to 150-year lows , leading one tabloid to dub scotland " the granny-flat of europe " .
while most european countries are turning away immigrants , scotland can not attract them - something that has led some politicians to demand an exemption from tight uk immigration controls .
a demanding country many - including the edinburgh government - fear that demographic factors could choke off scottish growth .
in fact , this fear may be exaggerated : historically , population growth is not a pre-requisite for economic growth , but tends to follow as a consequence of it .
far more serious as a long-term constraint to growth is the lumpy shape of the scottish economy .
-lrb- click here for a map of scottish regional incomes -rrb- most of the population live in the central belt , roughly along the m8 motorway between glasgow and edinburgh , and up the east coast towards aberdeen .
the sprawling isolation of the rest of the country demands high levels of investment in transport and other public services .
combined with significant levels of deprivation in west-central scotland , and a generally poor level of public health , the country can hardly avoid a higher basic level of public spending than the uk average , says jeremy peat of the royal bank of scotland .
" the demands placed on public funds in scotland are simply higher than those elsewhere , " he says .
spreading it out consciously or not , scotland may have sacrificed some of its growth potential in order to redistribute wealth more equitably .
according to brian ashcroft , the structure of devolution makes edinburgh almost exclusively a spending government , while macroeconomic decisions are made in remote london .
" the population is really not all that concerned with economic growth , " he says .
" the executive has little incentive to worry about growing the economy . "
but as mr peat points out : " it 's a lot easier to redistribute wealth in an economy that 's growing strongly . "
maybe scotland 's stuttering economy needs more devolution , not less .
over the next few weeks , bbc news online will be looking more closely at some of the issues raised in this story .
next week , we report on attempts to revive the fortunes of scotland 's most isolated rural communities .

five years ago , a bbc survey found that two-thirds of scots thought their economy would improve through devolution .
it seems they were wrong .
as the overall uk economy has borne up well under the hammer blows of the past few years , scotland has fallen rapidly behind .
now , scottish growth is close to zero , while the uk as a whole is expanding by almost 2 % .
devolution has , many say , been a political triumph - can the same be said for the economy ?
ups and downs scotland 's economy is poised in a rather complicated situation .
gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- shrank in the first quarter and edged up in the second , but some feel a recovery of sorts may already have begun .
the scottish chambers ' business survey , a regular measure of commercial confidence , has pointed to a likely upturn before the end of the year .
scotland is a serial underperformer jeremy peat , royal bank of scotland and the royal bank of scotland 's purchasing managers ' index -lrb- pmi -rrb- , arguably the most closely-watched indicator of scottish business activity , has turned in an unexpectedly strong performance for the third quarter .
but scotland 's main pmi figure remains by far the lowest in the uk and cbi scotland 's latest manufacturing survey showed that october was the weakest month in a year-and-a-half - and that the percentage of scottish firms working below capacity was the highest in 11 years .
' serial underperformer ' whatever the precise definition of scotland 's current predicament , a predicament it certainly is .
" scotland is a serial underperformer , " says jeremy peat , royal bank of scotland 's chief economist .
jim wallace says government is starting to understand business growth has lagged the uk average for five years ; in broader measures , notably quality-of-life scores such as healthcare , scotland has been behind for far longer than that .
the present malaise is the result of the scotland 's phenomenal success in attracting hi-tech manufacturing investment during the 1990s .
" silicon glen " - a term no-one seems to use any more - seems to have contracted by about one-third last year alone , provoking the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the industrialised glasgow-edinburgh corridor .
and while scottish enterprise , the agency that looks after business north of the border , claims that inward investment has steadied this year , the longer-term trend is dismal .
shrinking slice in the early 1990s , scotland accounted for close to one-fifth of total uk inward investment ; now , it garners less than 7 % .
" the cake is getting smaller , and scotland 's share of that cake is shrinking , " admits jim wallace , minister for enterprise .
where big foreign investors such as motorola and ibm have retrenched , local business has failed to fill the gap .
some critics now point to a debilitating lack of commercial dynamism in scotland , the country which arguably did more than any other to define entrepreneurial capitalism .
critics lay the blame at the door of the scottish executive , which is accused of simultaneously featherbedding scots through lavish grants and welfare payments , and battering companies with increased bureaucracy and higher business costs .
exchanges over rates the debate over whether scotland 's business environment really has deteriorated is fierce , and still unresolved .
devolved scotland has little fiscal leeway , but critics say the executive has unfairly ramped up business rates - which are now some 9 % higher than in england and wales .
mr wallace points out that the scottish business tax burden is " just under the european average - better than france , and about the same as germany " .
but cbi scotland director iain mcmillan argues : " we must remember that scottish firms operate against a skills and transport infrastructure deficit -lsb- compared with other eu countries -rsb- .
our business tax system should be compensating for this .
it is not . "
at the scottish chambers of commerce , deputy director warrick malcolm is wary about blaming devolved government for worsening business conditions .
" but we are looking forward to seeing evidence that the -lsb- edinburgh -rsb- government understands how to help business , " he says .
" it 's slim pickings so far . "
home-grown hopes to be fair , scotland 's five-year-old government has now made the economy - belatedly , say many - one of its top priorities .
after a frosty first couple of years , mr wallace and his colleagues now claim a much cosier relationship with the business community .

tomomasa nakagawa , 41 , was accused of helping to make the sarin gas , which killed 12 people and left thousands ill , and participating in other crimes led by the cult between 1989 and 1995 .
his sentencing came a day before the start of a defence plea for the cult 's former leader , shoko asahara , who also faces the death penalty .
aum shinrikyo renamed aleph and claims it is now benign has about 1,000 lay followers and 650 followers in cult communes predicted an apocalypse that only cult members would survive asahara , whose real name is chizuo matsumoto , has been on trial for seven and a half years .
a ruling is expected on 27 february .
defence lawyers for nakagawa had argued he had no criminal intent .
but he had already pleaded guilty to the murder , in 1989 , of a lawyer who was handling complaints against the cult .
nakagawa was also accused of taking part in a 1994 gassing in the central japanese city of matsumoto and of several attempted murders using cyanide fumes , vx gas , sarin and a letter bomb , japan 's kyodo news agency said .
he became the 10th member of aum to face the death penalty .
none has so far been executed - the other nine members have filed appeals .
japan 's justice minister warned earlier this year that the cult still posed a public threat .
a report compiled by the justice ministry 's public security investigation agency said that aum had about 650 live-in followers and some 1,000 outside believers , as of the end of december 2002 .
aum went bankrupt in 1996 , after the arrest of its top leaders .
it has since changed its name to aleph and claims to have renounced violence under its new leader , fumihiro joyu .
but the justice ministry says that under mr joyu 's leadership , the group continues to worship asahara 's " dangerous " teachings .
the group maintains 28 offices and 120 apartments in 17 prefectures throughout japan and has 300 members in russia , the 2002 report said .
the cult is said to use different names to offer yoga lessons and computer classes in order to finance its activities and recruit new members .

air arabia aims to emulate us and european no-frills pioneers the firm , air arabia , is based at sharjah international airport in the united arab emirates .
its first service is the 55-minute hop from sharjah to bahrain , but its 14 flights a week also go to beirut , damascus , kuwait and muscat .
tehran is due to follow , along with egypt and south asia .
the gulf already has one low-cast airline : gulf traveller - an arm of gulf air , which began services out of abu dhabi in july .
gulf traveller sells itself as a full service but economy class airline , rather than following the full budget model pioneered by the likes of easyjet in the uk and southwest in the us .
air arabia , in contrast , is a ticketless airline and very low on in-flight frills .
prices for its airbus a-320s are around a third those of its competitors , in a region which has been one of the most expensive areas to fly from despite the large number of carriers serving a relatively sparse population .
the target market is much the same as gulf traveller 's , though , particularly expatriates and guest workers visiting home .
for some of those from the levant it offers a cheap flight rather than the long overland drive through the desert .
but the traffic is likely to be seasonal .
at the last count air arabia 's first commercial flight was only 10 % full .

air arabia aims to emulate us and european no-frills pioneers the firm , air arabia , is based at sharjah international airport in the united arab emirates .
its first service is the 55-minute hop from sharjah to bahrain , but its 14 flights a week also go to beirut , damascus , kuwait and muscat .

the gulf already has one low-cast airline : gulf traveller - an arm of gulf air , which began services out of abu dhabi in july .
gulf traveller sells itself as a full service but economy class airline , rather than following the full budget model pioneered by the likes of easyjet in the uk and southwest in the us .
air arabia , in contrast , is a ticketless airline and very low on in-flight frills .
prices for its airbus a-320s are around a third those of its competitors , in a region which has been one of the most expensive areas to fly from despite the large number of carriers serving a relatively sparse population .

masahiko shizawa , 43 , filed a lawsuit on monday , alleging the search of his hotel room took away his dignity .
his action did not give details of how much he was seeking , but he is thought to have incurred legal costs of over $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.25m -rrb- during his earlier trial .
police have not yet commented on mr shizawa 's action .
the businessman is also suing the singer and her bodyguards for emotional distress , and is seeking unspecified damages from the pop star .
he was found guilty of stalking spears , 21 , by a superior court judge earlier this month .
under the restraining order , mr shizawa is banned from coming closer than 300 metres away from spears and must not contact her for the next three years .
' harmless ' spears sought a restraining order against the man in december 2002 , saying he tried to contact her at two of her homes and her parent 's house .
he also allegedly sent photos of himself and notes saying " i 'm chasing you " .
mr shizawa returned to japan when his visa expired in december , but his lawyer said he wanted to resolve the issue so he could eventually return to the united states .
simon robert hiller had argued that mr shizawa , a computer programmer and inventor , was harmless and the confusion arose from a cultural misunderstanding .
he said his client was a law-abiding citizen who was " in love " with spears .

those agreeing to donations have increased by 700 % at the royal bolton hospital since fiona wilkinson was appointed donor liaison sister .
it is an improvement the trust scarcely hoped possible when they set up a new team , borrowing ideas from spain - which now carries out the highest number of organ transplants in the world .

the east finchley to euston section remains closed after services were suspended on the whole line following the derailment on 19 october at camden town , north london , which injured seven people .
london underground 's -lrb- lu -rrb- managing director tim o 'toole said : " i 'm sorry this has taken longer than expected , but we had to be assured that this section of line was safe to reopen before we started to run trains again .
strike action " i hope we will have a northern line service to all stations soon , though the extent of the damage caused by the derailment means we wo n't be able to return to the previous level of service immediately . "
tube lines , the consortium in charge of maintenance on the line , is still trying to find out why the accident happened .
it was the second derailment inside 48 hours and union leaders are now pressing ahead with plans to ballot tube workers for a strike over safety .
on 17 october a piccadilly line train derailed at hammersmith in west london .
crisis talks crisis talks were held between representatives of the rail , maritime and transport union -lrb- rmt -rrb- and managers on tuesday aimed at preventing industrial action .
but union leaders say they " heard nothing " to stop them balloting members over industrial action .
the rmt union opposed the privatisation of tube maintenance on safety grounds and wants it to be returned to lu .
