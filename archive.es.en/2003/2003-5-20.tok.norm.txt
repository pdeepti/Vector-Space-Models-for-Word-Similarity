the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered . european union defense ministers meeting in brussels on monday reached an important milestone with the announcement that the eu ’ s planned 60,000-strong rapid reaction force would likely be ready for deployment to crisis regions by the end of the year .
in a joint declaration , the ministers said the eu was close to being prepared to handle crises running the full gamut of petersberg tasks - an outline of responsibilities for the force laid out during a summit held in a suburb of bonn , germany , in 1999 .
the agreement includes plans that range from dealing with humanitarian and rescue operations to keeping apart warring parties in conflict zones outside and inside europe .
the eu has already been approached by united nations secretary general kofi anan to send an eu force to support an emergency u.n. force in eastern congo , where fighting has left hundreds dead and thousands homeless and hungry .
" i have presented the demand to the ministers and in principle they have been positive , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters .
last month , the eu launched its first ever foray into joint peacekeeping by sending a 350-strong force to macedonia .
it is also considering taking the helm of a larger mission to bosnia , currently being managed by nato , next year .
force still lacks crucial capabilities despite the considerable momentum behind the project , the ministers conceded that the fledgling crisis management force still lacks vital and expensive military capabilities .
the force suffers from serious defense shortfalls that include transport aircraft , planes capable of air-to-air refueling and sufficient equipment to provide protection from chemical and biological attacks .
additionally , none of the 10 air-to-ground surveillance aircraft pledged by member states has yet materialized .
" these limitations and / or constraints are on deployment time and high risk ... in particular when conducting concurrent operations , " they said in the declaration .
the eu has less than six months to go before it is supposed to meet the " headline goal , " which envisages a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force that could be deployed within 60 days and remain on the ground for up to a year .
british defense minister geoff hoon said reaching such a goal was unlikely , pointing out that it took 70 days for britain to deploy 45,000 troops used in the war against iraq . " my message to colleagues today was that we still have a great deal more to do to meet the shortfalls in capacity , " hoon told reporters on monday .
" my message today was that they can ’ t put it in a box marked ‘ we ’ ve done that , ’ because they haven ’ t . "
even eu foreign policy chief javier solana made no bones about the enormity of the task facing the eu .
" it is hardly the time to rest on our laurels , " solana told ministers in brussels .
budget shortfalls in 2001 , the eu set up 19 expert panels to identify the biggest shortcomings that would have to be overcome in order to make the joint defense project a success and how to better pool the resources necessary to achieve that goal .
but the defense project has been badly hit with several countries lowering their defense budgets or letting them stagnate in the face of general belt-tightening .
" i don ’ t see signs that countries will increase budgets , " an eu military official told reuters on monday .
" so it ’ s a question of how willing they are , politically , to coordinate and get better output from what little they are prepared to spend . "
germany wants relaxed spending rules among the proposals on the board for rectifying the strained financial situation were efforts to forge a unified and lucrative eu defense industry .
but several countries also called for a loosening of the economic pact that ensures the stability of the euro , europe 's common currency .
germany , france and italy have called for relaxation of the eu ’ s strict public spending rules by excluding defense from overall expenditure and thus boosting europe ’ s military capabilities .
the three countries argued that military spending was being curtailed by the stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro by limiting public expenditure to below three percent of gross domestic product .
europe 's total annual defense spending amounts to just € 40 billion -lrb- $ 46.8 billion -rrb- contrasted with a u.s. military budget of $ 100 billion a year .
german defense minister peter struck , whose country is already in breach of the pact , said british criticism that eu defense ministers were failing to improve military capabilities or increase defense budget was completely justified .
struck said in brussels on monday that he was still aiming to increase defense spending in the near future .
germany 's current defense budget amounts to € 25 billion and accounts for 1.2 percent of german gdp according to struck .
military investments make up a quarter of the total defense budget .
the minister is likely to take up the matter with german finance minister eichel who remains determined to curtail the defense budget .
" that is a point , which has to be discussed further , " struck said in brussels .
berlin is also increasing its contribution to the eu rapid reaction force by 1,000 soldiers , thus increasing the german contingent to 33,000 troops .

european union defense officials say their rapid reaction force can be deployable within a year .
but the u.s. and great britain want europe 's soldiers to serve nato , not the eu .

dw-world takes a look at teen music sensation , t.a.t.u. it 's been a while since we had something to look forward to at eurovision .
most years song contest fans are faced with out of tune euro-pop hits and hapless presenters struggling with a script delivered simultaneously in french , english and their native language .
but not this year .
no , this year eurovision has t.a.t.u.
the russian lesbian teen pop sensation who will represent their home country at this saturday 's contest in the latvian capital , riga , are odds-on favorites to win and give moscow the chance to host next year 's contest .
the bookies have even got good odds on the pair – - who say they are lovers – kissing on stage .
the duo , consisting of 17 year-old lena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova , have been hot property since they shot to fame across europe at the start of the year .
the band - whose name is a shortened form of the russian , " ta dyevushka lubit tu " – " this girl loves that one " - is managed by a former child psychologist and filmmaker , ivan shapovalov , who created the act in 1998 .
school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .
rumors over the credibility and motives of the band ’ s manager , who supposedly came up with the idea of an underage lesbian band to attract scandal-seeking media attention , have also surfaced in recent weeks , dampening the girls ’ rebellious image .
cashing in on scandal but with odds of 9-2 , t.a.t.u is still a favorite to win eurovision this year .

dw-world takes a look at teen music sensation , t.a.t.u. it 's been a while since we had something to look forward to at eurovision .
most years song contest fans are faced with out of tune euro-pop hits and hapless presenters struggling with a script delivered simultaneously in french , english and their native language .
but not this year .
no , this year eurovision has t.a.t.u.
the russian lesbian teen pop sensation who will represent their home country at this saturday 's contest in the latvian capital , riga , are odds-on favorites to win and give moscow the chance to host next year 's contest .
the bookies have even got good odds on the pair – - who say they are lovers – kissing on stage .
the duo , consisting of 17 year-old lena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova , have been hot property since they shot to fame across europe at the start of the year .
the band - whose name is a shortened form of the russian , " ta dyevushka lubit tu " – " this girl loves that one " - is managed by a former child psychologist and filmmaker , ivan shapovalov , who created the act in 1998 .
school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .
rumors over the credibility and motives of the band ’ s manager , who supposedly came up with the idea of an underage lesbian band to attract scandal-seeking media attention , have also surfaced in recent weeks , dampening the girls ’ rebellious image .
cashing in on scandal but with odds of 9-2 , t.a.t.u is still a favorite to win eurovision this year .
unofficial fan sites for the pair are rallying viewers by posting instructions on how to vote for the pair .
and no matter what happens on saturday , eurovision organizers are preparing for all eventualities .
" we do n't know what they 'll do on stage – you never do with this group , " eurovision spokesperson sovita vevere told reuters .
" but we will have a taped performance from the dress rehearsal , so we can always switch to that if we need to . "

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .
also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .
bernhard may is a transatlantic specialist at the german council on foreign relations of course it 's good news for berlin in the sense that -lsb- powell -rsb- could have stayed at home or gone to a different city .
but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '
if it 's just a way of telling us europeans what we have to do then it will be very difficult .
radek sikorski is a former polish defense and foreign minister .
he is now executive director of the american enterprise institute 's new atlantic initiative in washington , d.c. the reading in washington is that germany has found itself in the position its in through a series of opportunistic political decisions and coincidences , but that fundamentally germany wishes to remain a u.s. ally .
france , on the other hand , has an alternative strategic vision .
france thinks germany should be the horse , the rest of europe should be the cart , and france would be driver .
and france would drive the horse and cart into a head-on collision with an american tank .
dagmar weiler is director of the bridge of understanding , a german-american nonprofit organization based in munich that organizes trips to germany for american jews .
i do n't think we should put too much emphasis on it .
it 's a start , that 's all .
the problems between the chancellor and the president will never be solved .
secondly it 's powell who 's coming , not the president .
when you do go to the u.s. and specifically to the heartland and you explain what germans think about the war and about the government , once they see that there 's more to it than simple anti-americanism as reported in the media , they are willing to come to germany and experience it firsthand .
i think we need to intensify that contact on the level of political foundations and institutions .
presidents and chancellors go , but we will always be here . jackson janes is executive director of the american insitute for contemporary german studies in washington , d.c. i think -lrb- in washington -rrb- there was this concern about germany and its relationship with france as part of the challenge to the us .
in the past , they have always tried to be a go-between and this time they took sides ...
they got themselves into a box with france , they did not have a profile and did not have a coherent position vis-a-vis the united states and they 're going to have to figure that out in the future .
powell is the one looked to by germans and europeans as someone who had an ear for their concerns , and to some extent that seems to be the case .
walther leisler kiep , member of the u.s.-friendly christian democratic union in germany and chairman emeritus of the transatlantic organization atlantik brücke .
the personal relationship between the chancellor and the president is a serious matter .
i think -lsb- this visit -rsb- is a matter which will certainly help in the direction of normalization .
several dates where they are all going to be meeting in the coming mothhs and that 's why this visit at this time is very important . i assure you that there is a wide view in germany among the people ... that everybody 's happy that the victory in iraq came so soon , everyone is happy that we got rid of saddam hussein .
that is clear .
on the other hand , this does not imply a change of vie or change in their opposition to the war . interviews conducted by andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit the dw-world dossier on the transatlantic relationship and powell 's trip to berlin 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .
also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .
bernhard may is a transatlantic specialist at the german council on foreign relations of course it 's good news for berlin in the sense that -lsb- powell -rsb- could have stayed at home or gone to a different city .
but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '
if it 's just a way of telling us europeans what we have to do then it will be very difficult .
radek sikorski is a former polish defense and foreign minister .
he is now executive director of the american enterprise institute 's new atlantic initiative in washington , d.c. the reading in washington is that germany has found itself in the position its in through a series of opportunistic political decisions and coincidences , but that fundamentally germany wishes to remain a u.s. ally .
france , on the other hand , has an alternative strategic vision .
france thinks germany should be the horse , the rest of europe should be the cart , and france would be driver .
and france would drive the horse and cart into a head-on collision with an american tank .
dagmar weiler is director of the bridge of understanding , a german-american nonprofit organization based in munich that organizes trips to germany for american jews .
i do n't think we should put too much emphasis on it .
it 's a start , that 's all .
the problems between the chancellor and the president will never be solved .
secondly it 's powell who 's coming , not the president .
when you do go to the u.s. and specifically to the heartland and you explain what germans think about the war and about the government , once they see that there 's more to it than simple anti-americanism as reported in the media , they are willing to come to germany and experience it firsthand .
i think we need to intensify that contact on the level of political foundations and institutions .
presidents and chancellors go , but we will always be here . jackson janes is executive director of the american insitute for contemporary german studies in washington , d.c. i think -lrb- in washington -rrb- there was this concern about germany and its relationship with france as part of the challenge to the us .
in the past , they have always tried to be a go-between and this time they took sides ...
they got themselves into a box with france , they did not have a profile and did not have a coherent position vis-a-vis the united states and they 're going to have to figure that out in the future .
powell is the one looked to by germans and europeans as someone who had an ear for their concerns , and to some extent that seems to be the case .
walther leisler kiep , member of the u.s.-friendly christian democratic union in germany and chairman emeritus of the transatlantic organization atlantik brücke .
the personal relationship between the chancellor and the president is a serious matter .
i think -lsb- this visit -rsb- is a matter which will certainly help in the direction of normalization .
several dates where they are all going to be meeting in the coming mothhs and that 's why this visit at this time is very important . i assure you that there is a wide view in germany among the people ... that everybody 's happy that the victory in iraq came so soon , everyone is happy that we got rid of saddam hussein .
that is clear .
on the other hand , this does not imply a change of vie or change in their opposition to the war . interviews conducted by andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit the dw-world dossier on the transatlantic relationship and powell 's trip to berlin 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .
also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .
bernhard may is a transatlantic specialist at the german council on foreign relations of course it 's good news for berlin in the sense that -lsb- powell -rsb- could have stayed at home or gone to a different city .
but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '
if it 's just a way of telling us europeans what we have to do then it will be very difficult .
radek sikorski is a former polish defense and foreign minister .
he is now executive director of the american enterprise institute 's new atlantic initiative in washington , d.c. the reading in washington is that germany has found itself in the position its in through a series of opportunistic political decisions and coincidences , but that fundamentally germany wishes to remain a u.s. ally .
france , on the other hand , has an alternative strategic vision .
france thinks germany should be the horse , the rest of europe should be the cart , and france would be driver .
and france would drive the horse and cart into a head-on collision with an american tank .
dagmar weiler is director of the bridge of understanding , a german-american nonprofit organization based in munich that organizes trips to germany for american jews .
i do n't think we should put too much emphasis on it .
it 's a start , that 's all .
the problems between the chancellor and the president will never be solved .
secondly it 's powell who 's coming , not the president .
when you do go to the u.s. and specifically to the heartland and you explain what germans think about the war and about the government , once they see that there 's more to it than simple anti-americanism as reported in the media , they are willing to come to germany and experience it firsthand .
i think we need to intensify that contact on the level of political foundations and institutions .
presidents and chancellors go , but we will always be here . jackson janes is executive director of the american insitute for contemporary german studies in washington , d.c. i think -lrb- in washington -rrb- there was this concern about germany and its relationship with france as part of the challenge to the us .
in the past , they have always tried to be a go-between and this time they took sides ...
they got themselves into a box with france , they did not have a profile and did not have a coherent position vis-a-vis the united states and they 're going to have to figure that out in the future .
powell is the one looked to by germans and europeans as someone who had an ear for their concerns , and to some extent that seems to be the case .
walther leisler kiep , member of the u.s.-friendly christian democratic union in germany and chairman emeritus of the transatlantic organization atlantik brücke .
the personal relationship between the chancellor and the president is a serious matter .
i think -lsb- this visit -rsb- is a matter which will certainly help in the direction of normalization .
several dates where they are all going to be meeting in the coming mothhs and that 's why this visit at this time is very important . i assure you that there is a wide view in germany among the people ... that everybody 's happy that the victory in iraq came so soon , everyone is happy that we got rid of saddam hussein .
that is clear .
on the other hand , this does not imply a change of vie or change in their opposition to the war . interviews conducted by andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit the dw-world dossier on the transatlantic relationship and powell 's trip to berlin 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered . european union defense ministers meeting in brussels on monday reached an important milestone with the announcement that the eu ’ s planned 60,000-strong rapid reaction force would likely be ready for deployment to crisis regions by the end of the year .
in a joint declaration , the ministers said the eu was close to being prepared to handle crises running the full gamut of petersberg tasks - an outline of responsibilities for the force laid out during a summit held in a suburb of bonn , germany , in 1999 .
the agreement includes plans that range from dealing with humanitarian and rescue operations to keeping apart warring parties in conflict zones outside and inside europe .
the eu has already been approached by united nations secretary general kofi anan to send an eu force to support an emergency u.n. force in eastern congo , where fighting has left hundreds dead and thousands homeless and hungry .
" i have presented the demand to the ministers and in principle they have been positive , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters .
last month , the eu launched its first ever foray into joint peacekeeping by sending a 350-strong force to macedonia .
it is also considering taking the helm of a larger mission to bosnia , currently being managed by nato , next year .
force still lacks crucial capabilities despite the considerable momentum behind the project , the ministers conceded that the fledgling crisis management force still lacks vital and expensive military capabilities .
the force suffers from serious defense shortfalls that include transport aircraft , planes capable of air-to-air refueling and sufficient equipment to provide protection from chemical and biological attacks .
additionally , none of the 10 air-to-ground surveillance aircraft pledged by member states has yet materialized .
" these limitations and / or constraints are on deployment time and high risk ... in particular when conducting concurrent operations , " they said in the declaration .
the eu has less than six months to go before it is supposed to meet the " headline goal , " which envisages a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force that could be deployed within 60 days and remain on the ground for up to a year .
british defense minister geoff hoon said reaching such a goal was unlikely , pointing out that it took 70 days for britain to deploy 45,000 troops used in the war against iraq . " my message to colleagues today was that we still have a great deal more to do to meet the shortfalls in capacity , " hoon told reporters on monday .
" my message today was that they can ’ t put it in a box marked ‘ we ’ ve done that , ’ because they haven ’ t . "
even eu foreign policy chief javier solana made no bones about the enormity of the task facing the eu .
" it is hardly the time to rest on our laurels , " solana told ministers in brussels .
budget shortfalls in 2001 , the eu set up 19 expert panels to identify the biggest shortcomings that would have to be overcome in order to make the joint defense project a success and how to better pool the resources necessary to achieve that goal .
but the defense project has been badly hit with several countries lowering their defense budgets or letting them stagnate in the face of general belt-tightening .
" i don ’ t see signs that countries will increase budgets , " an eu military official told reuters on monday .
" so it ’ s a question of how willing they are , politically , to coordinate and get better output from what little they are prepared to spend . "
germany wants relaxed spending rules among the proposals on the board for rectifying the strained financial situation were efforts to forge a unified and lucrative eu defense industry .
but several countries also called for a loosening of the economic pact that ensures the stability of the euro , europe 's common currency .
germany , france and italy have called for relaxation of the eu ’ s strict public spending rules by excluding defense from overall expenditure and thus boosting europe ’ s military capabilities .
the three countries argued that military spending was being curtailed by the stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro by limiting public expenditure to below three percent of gross domestic product .
europe 's total annual defense spending amounts to just € 40 billion -lrb- $ 46.8 billion -rrb- contrasted with a u.s. military budget of $ 100 billion a year .
german defense minister peter struck , whose country is already in breach of the pact , said british criticism that eu defense ministers were failing to improve military capabilities or increase defense budget was completely justified .
struck said in brussels on monday that he was still aiming to increase defense spending in the near future .
germany 's current defense budget amounts to € 25 billion and accounts for 1.2 percent of german gdp according to struck .
military investments make up a quarter of the total defense budget .
the minister is likely to take up the matter with german finance minister eichel who remains determined to curtail the defense budget .
" that is a point , which has to be discussed further , " struck said in brussels .
berlin is also increasing its contribution to the eu rapid reaction force by 1,000 soldiers , thus increasing the german contingent to 33,000 troops .

budget shortfalls in 2001 , the eu set up 19 expert panels to identify the biggest shortcomings that would have to be overcome in order to make the joint defense project a success and how to better pool the resources necessary to achieve that goal .

germany , france and italy have called for relaxation of the eu ’ s strict public spending rules by excluding defense from overall expenditure and thus boosting europe ’ s military capabilities .
the three countries argued that military spending was being curtailed by the stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro by limiting public expenditure to below three percent of gross domestic product .
europe 's total annual defense spending amounts to just € 40 billion -lrb- $ 46.8 billion -rrb- contrasted with a u.s. military budget of $ 100 billion a year .

the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered . european union defense ministers meeting in brussels on monday reached an important milestone with the announcement that the eu ’ s planned 60,000-strong rapid reaction force would likely be ready for deployment to crisis regions by the end of the year .
in a joint declaration , the ministers said the eu was close to being prepared to handle crises running the full gamut of petersberg tasks - an outline of responsibilities for the force laid out during a summit held in a suburb of bonn , germany , in 1999 .
the agreement includes plans that range from dealing with humanitarian and rescue operations to keeping apart warring parties in conflict zones outside and inside europe .
the eu has already been approached by united nations secretary general kofi anan to send an eu force to support an emergency u.n. force in eastern congo , where fighting has left hundreds dead and thousands homeless and hungry .
" i have presented the demand to the ministers and in principle they have been positive , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters .
last month , the eu launched its first ever foray into joint peacekeeping by sending a 350-strong force to macedonia .
it is also considering taking the helm of a larger mission to bosnia , currently being managed by nato , next year .
force still lacks crucial capabilities despite the considerable momentum behind the project , the ministers conceded that the fledgling crisis management force still lacks vital and expensive military capabilities .
the force suffers from serious defense shortfalls that include transport aircraft , planes capable of air-to-air refueling and sufficient equipment to provide protection from chemical and biological attacks .
additionally , none of the 10 air-to-ground surveillance aircraft pledged by member states has yet materialized .
" these limitations and / or constraints are on deployment time and high risk ... in particular when conducting concurrent operations , " they said in the declaration .
the eu has less than six months to go before it is supposed to meet the " headline goal , " which envisages a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force that could be deployed within 60 days and remain on the ground for up to a year .
british defense minister geoff hoon said reaching such a goal was unlikely , pointing out that it took 70 days for britain to deploy 45,000 troops used in the war against iraq .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .
also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .
bernhard may is a transatlantic specialist at the german council on foreign relations of course it 's good news for berlin in the sense that -lsb- powell -rsb- could have stayed at home or gone to a different city .
but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '
if it 's just a way of telling us europeans what we have to do then it will be very difficult .
radek sikorski is a former polish defense and foreign minister .
he is now executive director of the american enterprise institute 's new atlantic initiative in washington , d.c. the reading in washington is that germany has found itself in the position its in through a series of opportunistic political decisions and coincidences , but that fundamentally germany wishes to remain a u.s. ally .
france , on the other hand , has an alternative strategic vision .
france thinks germany should be the horse , the rest of europe should be the cart , and france would be driver .
and france would drive the horse and cart into a head-on collision with an american tank .
dagmar weiler is director of the bridge of understanding , a german-american nonprofit organization based in munich that organizes trips to germany for american jews .
i do n't think we should put too much emphasis on it .
it 's a start , that 's all .
the problems between the chancellor and the president will never be solved .
secondly it 's powell who 's coming , not the president .
when you do go to the u.s. and specifically to the heartland and you explain what germans think about the war and about the government , once they see that there 's more to it than simple anti-americanism as reported in the media , they are willing to come to germany and experience it firsthand .
i think we need to intensify that contact on the level of political foundations and institutions .
presidents and chancellors go , but we will always be here . jackson janes is executive director of the american insitute for contemporary german studies in washington , d.c. i think -lrb- in washington -rrb- there was this concern about germany and its relationship with france as part of the challenge to the us .
in the past , they have always tried to be a go-between and this time they took sides ...
they got themselves into a box with france , they did not have a profile and did not have a coherent position vis-a-vis the united states and they 're going to have to figure that out in the future .
powell is the one looked to by germans and europeans as someone who had an ear for their concerns , and to some extent that seems to be the case .
walther leisler kiep , member of the u.s.-friendly christian democratic union in germany and chairman emeritus of the transatlantic organization atlantik brücke .
the personal relationship between the chancellor and the president is a serious matter .
i think -lsb- this visit -rsb- is a matter which will certainly help in the direction of normalization .
several dates where they are all going to be meeting in the coming mothhs and that 's why this visit at this time is very important . i assure you that there is a wide view in germany among the people ... that everybody 's happy that the victory in iraq came so soon , everyone is happy that we got rid of saddam hussein .
that is clear .
on the other hand , this does not imply a change of vie or change in their opposition to the war . interviews conducted by andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit the dw-world dossier on the transatlantic relationship and powell 's trip to berlin 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

warsaw has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for soldiers .
germany has said it will only send soldiers under a united nations mandate . poland has asked nato for help in filling out the 10,000-soldier security force it pledged to patrol parts of postwar iraq , germany 's defense minister confirmed to reporters during an eu defense ministers meeting monday . warsaw had said it was prepared to take over duties from british and american troops in one of three military sectors in iraq but lacked the troops for the job . the polish government has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for help .
poland can only supply 2,000 of the 10,000 troops needed for the reconstruction mission . italy , spain , denmark , the netherlands , bulgaria and the ukraine have already agreed to supply troops for the stability force which could be sent to the gulf at short notice .
still unclear is exactly who will provide the force its mandate . nato chiefs have said in the past they agree in principal to discuss the issue .
the united nations has not yet begun discussing the possibility publicly . german involvement unclear germany has maintiained that it will need a u.n. mandate before sending troops to postwar iraq .
german defense minister peter struck bristled earlier this month when informed poland wanted to make use of nato brigade comprising danish , german and polish troops for their postwar iraq duties . " i find it remarkable that poland and other countries are ready to take responsibility in iraq .
these countries know that for germany , any engagement in iraq is tied to u.n. involvement .
this is unforeseen as yet and , as such , it 's not something we have to consider , " struck told reporters . after talks described as " candid " with u.s. defense secretary colin powell last friday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was still hopeful for u.n. involvement in postwar iraq .
the two , however , said they had not discussed the possibility of using nato troops in securing the war-torn country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish peacekeeping proposal riles berlin berlin reacted frostily to a surprise proposal from poland that its soldiers team up with german and danish troops to keep the peace in postwar iraq .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .
also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .
bernhard may is a transatlantic specialist at the german council on foreign relations of course it 's good news for berlin in the sense that -lsb- powell -rsb- could have stayed at home or gone to a different city .
but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '
if it 's just a way of telling us europeans what we have to do then it will be very difficult .
radek sikorski is a former polish defense and foreign minister .
he is now executive director of the american enterprise institute 's new atlantic initiative in washington , d.c. the reading in washington is that germany has found itself in the position its in through a series of opportunistic political decisions and coincidences , but that fundamentally germany wishes to remain a u.s. ally .
france , on the other hand , has an alternative strategic vision .
france thinks germany should be the horse , the rest of europe should be the cart , and france would be driver .
and france would drive the horse and cart into a head-on collision with an american tank .
dagmar weiler is director of the bridge of understanding , a german-american nonprofit organization based in munich that organizes trips to germany for american jews .
i do n't think we should put too much emphasis on it .
it 's a start , that 's all .
the problems between the chancellor and the president will never be solved .
secondly it 's powell who 's coming , not the president .
when you do go to the u.s. and specifically to the heartland and you explain what germans think about the war and about the government , once they see that there 's more to it than simple anti-americanism as reported in the media , they are willing to come to germany and experience it firsthand .
i think we need to intensify that contact on the level of political foundations and institutions .
presidents and chancellors go , but we will always be here . jackson janes is executive director of the american insitute for contemporary german studies in washington , d.c. i think -lrb- in washington -rrb- there was this concern about germany and its relationship with france as part of the challenge to the us .
in the past , they have always tried to be a go-between and this time they took sides ...
they got themselves into a box with france , they did not have a profile and did not have a coherent position vis-a-vis the united states and they 're going to have to figure that out in the future .
powell is the one looked to by germans and europeans as someone who had an ear for their concerns , and to some extent that seems to be the case .
walther leisler kiep , member of the u.s.-friendly christian democratic union in germany and chairman emeritus of the transatlantic organization atlantik brücke .
the personal relationship between the chancellor and the president is a serious matter .
i think -lsb- this visit -rsb- is a matter which will certainly help in the direction of normalization .
several dates where they are all going to be meeting in the coming mothhs and that 's why this visit at this time is very important . i assure you that there is a wide view in germany among the people ... that everybody 's happy that the victory in iraq came so soon , everyone is happy that we got rid of saddam hussein .
that is clear .
on the other hand , this does not imply a change of vie or change in their opposition to the war . interviews conducted by andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit the dw-world dossier on the transatlantic relationship and powell 's trip to berlin 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

dw-world takes a look at teen music sensation , t.a.t.u. it 's been a while since we had something to look forward to at eurovision .
most years song contest fans are faced with out of tune euro-pop hits and hapless presenters struggling with a script delivered simultaneously in french , english and their native language .
but not this year .
no , this year eurovision has t.a.t.u.
the russian lesbian teen pop sensation who will represent their home country at this saturday 's contest in the latvian capital , riga , are odds-on favorites to win and give moscow the chance to host next year 's contest .
the bookies have even got good odds on the pair – - who say they are lovers – kissing on stage .
the duo , consisting of 17 year-old lena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova , have been hot property since they shot to fame across europe at the start of the year .
the band - whose name is a shortened form of the russian , " ta dyevushka lubit tu " – " this girl loves that one " - is managed by a former child psychologist and filmmaker , ivan shapovalov , who created the act in 1998 .
school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .
rumors over the credibility and motives of the band ’ s manager , who supposedly came up with the idea of an underage lesbian band to attract scandal-seeking media attention , have also surfaced in recent weeks , dampening the girls ’ rebellious image .
cashing in on scandal but with odds of 9-2 , t.a.t.u is still a favorite to win eurovision this year .
unofficial fan sites for the pair are rallying viewers by posting instructions on how to vote for the pair .
and no matter what happens on saturday , eurovision organizers are preparing for all eventualities .
" we do n't know what they 'll do on stage – you never do with this group , " eurovision spokesperson sovita vevere told reuters .
" but we will have a taped performance from the dress rehearsal , so we can always switch to that if we need to . "
bad news for those who have put a bet on the two having a snog on stage .
" obviously the kiss has to be seen on tv , otherwise we ca n't pay out , " ladbrookes betting spokesman , warren lush told dw-world . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " let 's get happy " goes to eurovision germany 's representative at this year 's eurovision song contest , the annual celebration of all things musical , tacky and european , will be " let 's get happy " sung by lou hoffner -lrb- march 9 , 2003 -rrb- .

school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .
rumors over the credibility and motives of the band ’ s manager , who supposedly came up with the idea of an underage lesbian band to attract scandal-seeking media attention , have also surfaced in recent weeks , dampening the girls ’ rebellious image .
cashing in on scandal but with odds of 9-2 , t.a.t.u is still a favorite to win eurovision this year .
unofficial fan sites for the pair are rallying viewers by posting instructions on how to vote for the pair .
and no matter what happens on saturday , eurovision organizers are preparing for all eventualities .
" we do n't know what they 'll do on stage – you never do with this group , " eurovision spokesperson sovita vevere told reuters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the powell visit schröder reaffirms strong ties to the united states iraq rift launches new era in german foreign policy opinion : has the transatlantic ice age ended ?
boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .
also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .
bernhard may is a transatlantic specialist at the german council on foreign relations of course it 's good news for berlin in the sense that -lsb- powell -rsb- could have stayed at home or gone to a different city .
but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '
if it 's just a way of telling us europeans what we have to do then it will be very difficult .
radek sikorski is a former polish defense and foreign minister .
he is now executive director of the american enterprise institute 's new atlantic initiative in washington , d.c. the reading in washington is that germany has found itself in the position its in through a series of opportunistic political decisions and coincidences , but that fundamentally germany wishes to remain a u.s. ally .
france , on the other hand , has an alternative strategic vision .
france thinks germany should be the horse , the rest of europe should be the cart , and france would be driver .
and france would drive the horse and cart into a head-on collision with an american tank .
dagmar weiler is director of the bridge of understanding , a german-american nonprofit organization based in munich that organizes trips to germany for american jews .
i do n't think we should put too much emphasis on it .
it 's a start , that 's all .
the problems between the chancellor and the president will never be solved .
secondly it 's powell who 's coming , not the president .
when you do go to the u.s. and specifically to the heartland and you explain what germans think about the war and about the government , once they see that there 's more to it than simple anti-americanism as reported in the media , they are willing to come to germany and experience it firsthand .
i think we need to intensify that contact on the level of political foundations and institutions .
presidents and chancellors go , but we will always be here . jackson janes is executive director of the american insitute for contemporary german studies in washington , d.c. i think -lrb- in washington -rrb- there was this concern about germany and its relationship with france as part of the challenge to the us .
in the past , they have always tried to be a go-between and this time they took sides ...
they got themselves into a box with france , they did not have a profile and did not have a coherent position vis-a-vis the united states and they 're going to have to figure that out in the future .
powell is the one looked to by germans and europeans as someone who had an ear for their concerns , and to some extent that seems to be the case .
walther leisler kiep , member of the u.s.-friendly christian democratic union in germany and chairman emeritus of the transatlantic organization atlantik brücke .
the personal relationship between the chancellor and the president is a serious matter .
i think -lsb- this visit -rsb- is a matter which will certainly help in the direction of normalization .
several dates where they are all going to be meeting in the coming mothhs and that 's why this visit at this time is very important . i assure you that there is a wide view in germany among the people ... that everybody 's happy that the victory in iraq came so soon , everyone is happy that we got rid of saddam hussein .
that is clear .
on the other hand , this does not imply a change of vie or change in their opposition to the war . interviews conducted by andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit the dw-world dossier on the transatlantic relationship and powell 's trip to berlin 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .
also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .
bernhard may is a transatlantic specialist at the german council on foreign relations of course it 's good news for berlin in the sense that -lsb- powell -rsb- could have stayed at home or gone to a different city .
but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '
if it 's just a way of telling us europeans what we have to do then it will be very difficult .
radek sikorski is a former polish defense and foreign minister .
he is now executive director of the american enterprise institute 's new atlantic initiative in washington , d.c. the reading in washington is that germany has found itself in the position its in through a series of opportunistic political decisions and coincidences , but that fundamentally germany wishes to remain a u.s. ally .
france , on the other hand , has an alternative strategic vision .
france thinks germany should be the horse , the rest of europe should be the cart , and france would be driver .
and france would drive the horse and cart into a head-on collision with an american tank .
dagmar weiler is director of the bridge of understanding , a german-american nonprofit organization based in munich that organizes trips to germany for american jews .
i do n't think we should put too much emphasis on it .
it 's a start , that 's all .
the problems between the chancellor and the president will never be solved .
secondly it 's powell who 's coming , not the president .
when you do go to the u.s. and specifically to the heartland and you explain what germans think about the war and about the government , once they see that there 's more to it than simple anti-americanism as reported in the media , they are willing to come to germany and experience it firsthand .
i think we need to intensify that contact on the level of political foundations and institutions .
presidents and chancellors go , but we will always be here . jackson janes is executive director of the american insitute for contemporary german studies in washington , d.c. i think -lrb- in washington -rrb- there was this concern about germany and its relationship with france as part of the challenge to the us .
in the past , they have always tried to be a go-between and this time they took sides ...
they got themselves into a box with france , they did not have a profile and did not have a coherent position vis-a-vis the united states and they 're going to have to figure that out in the future .

several dates where they are all going to be meeting in the coming mothhs and that 's why this visit at this time is very important . i assure you that there is a wide view in germany among the people ... that everybody 's happy that the victory in iraq came so soon , everyone is happy that we got rid of saddam hussein .

the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered . european union defense ministers meeting in brussels on monday reached an important milestone with the announcement that the eu ’ s planned 60,000-strong rapid reaction force would likely be ready for deployment to crisis regions by the end of the year .
in a joint declaration , the ministers said the eu was close to being prepared to handle crises running the full gamut of petersberg tasks - an outline of responsibilities for the force laid out during a summit held in a suburb of bonn , germany , in 1999 .
the agreement includes plans that range from dealing with humanitarian and rescue operations to keeping apart warring parties in conflict zones outside and inside europe .
the eu has already been approached by united nations secretary general kofi anan to send an eu force to support an emergency u.n. force in eastern congo , where fighting has left hundreds dead and thousands homeless and hungry .
" i have presented the demand to the ministers and in principle they have been positive , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters .
last month , the eu launched its first ever foray into joint peacekeeping by sending a 350-strong force to macedonia .
it is also considering taking the helm of a larger mission to bosnia , currently being managed by nato , next year .
force still lacks crucial capabilities despite the considerable momentum behind the project , the ministers conceded that the fledgling crisis management force still lacks vital and expensive military capabilities .
the force suffers from serious defense shortfalls that include transport aircraft , planes capable of air-to-air refueling and sufficient equipment to provide protection from chemical and biological attacks .
additionally , none of the 10 air-to-ground surveillance aircraft pledged by member states has yet materialized .
" these limitations and / or constraints are on deployment time and high risk ... in particular when conducting concurrent operations , " they said in the declaration .
the eu has less than six months to go before it is supposed to meet the " headline goal , " which envisages a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force that could be deployed within 60 days and remain on the ground for up to a year .
british defense minister geoff hoon said reaching such a goal was unlikely , pointing out that it took 70 days for britain to deploy 45,000 troops used in the war against iraq . " my message to colleagues today was that we still have a great deal more to do to meet the shortfalls in capacity , " hoon told reporters on monday .
" my message today was that they can ’ t put it in a box marked ‘ we ’ ve done that , ’ because they haven ’ t . "
even eu foreign policy chief javier solana made no bones about the enormity of the task facing the eu .
" it is hardly the time to rest on our laurels , " solana told ministers in brussels .
budget shortfalls in 2001 , the eu set up 19 expert panels to identify the biggest shortcomings that would have to be overcome in order to make the joint defense project a success and how to better pool the resources necessary to achieve that goal .
but the defense project has been badly hit with several countries lowering their defense budgets or letting them stagnate in the face of general belt-tightening .
" i don ’ t see signs that countries will increase budgets , " an eu military official told reuters on monday .
" so it ’ s a question of how willing they are , politically , to coordinate and get better output from what little they are prepared to spend . "
germany wants relaxed spending rules among the proposals on the board for rectifying the strained financial situation were efforts to forge a unified and lucrative eu defense industry .
but several countries also called for a loosening of the economic pact that ensures the stability of the euro , europe 's common currency .
germany , france and italy have called for relaxation of the eu ’ s strict public spending rules by excluding defense from overall expenditure and thus boosting europe ’ s military capabilities .
the three countries argued that military spending was being curtailed by the stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro by limiting public expenditure to below three percent of gross domestic product .
europe 's total annual defense spending amounts to just € 40 billion -lrb- $ 46.8 billion -rrb- contrasted with a u.s. military budget of $ 100 billion a year .
german defense minister peter struck , whose country is already in breach of the pact , said british criticism that eu defense ministers were failing to improve military capabilities or increase defense budget was completely justified .
struck said in brussels on monday that he was still aiming to increase defense spending in the near future .
germany 's current defense budget amounts to € 25 billion and accounts for 1.2 percent of german gdp according to struck .
military investments make up a quarter of the total defense budget .
the minister is likely to take up the matter with german finance minister eichel who remains determined to curtail the defense budget .
" that is a point , which has to be discussed further , " struck said in brussels .
berlin is also increasing its contribution to the eu rapid reaction force by 1,000 soldiers , thus increasing the german contingent to 33,000 troops .

british defense minister geoff hoon said reaching such a goal was unlikely , pointing out that it took 70 days for britain to deploy 45,000 troops used in the war against iraq . " my message to colleagues today was that we still have a great deal more to do to meet the shortfalls in capacity , " hoon told reporters on monday .
" my message today was that they can ’ t put it in a box marked ‘ we ’ ve done that , ’ because they haven ’ t . "
even eu foreign policy chief javier solana made no bones about the enormity of the task facing the eu .
" it is hardly the time to rest on our laurels , " solana told ministers in brussels .
budget shortfalls in 2001 , the eu set up 19 expert panels to identify the biggest shortcomings that would have to be overcome in order to make the joint defense project a success and how to better pool the resources necessary to achieve that goal .
but the defense project has been badly hit with several countries lowering their defense budgets or letting them stagnate in the face of general belt-tightening .
" i don ’ t see signs that countries will increase budgets , " an eu military official told reuters on monday .
" so it ’ s a question of how willing they are , politically , to coordinate and get better output from what little they are prepared to spend . "
germany wants relaxed spending rules among the proposals on the board for rectifying the strained financial situation were efforts to forge a unified and lucrative eu defense industry .
but several countries also called for a loosening of the economic pact that ensures the stability of the euro , europe 's common currency .
germany , france and italy have called for relaxation of the eu ’ s strict public spending rules by excluding defense from overall expenditure and thus boosting europe ’ s military capabilities .
the three countries argued that military spending was being curtailed by the stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro by limiting public expenditure to below three percent of gross domestic product .
europe 's total annual defense spending amounts to just € 40 billion -lrb- $ 46.8 billion -rrb- contrasted with a u.s. military budget of $ 100 billion a year .
german defense minister peter struck , whose country is already in breach of the pact , said british criticism that eu defense ministers were failing to improve military capabilities or increase defense budget was completely justified .
struck said in brussels on monday that he was still aiming to increase defense spending in the near future .
germany 's current defense budget amounts to € 25 billion and accounts for 1.2 percent of german gdp according to struck .
military investments make up a quarter of the total defense budget .
the minister is likely to take up the matter with german finance minister eichel who remains determined to curtail the defense budget .
" that is a point , which has to be discussed further , " struck said in brussels .
berlin is also increasing its contribution to the eu rapid reaction force by 1,000 soldiers , thus increasing the german contingent to 33,000 troops .

the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered . european union defense ministers meeting in brussels on monday reached an important milestone with the announcement that the eu ’ s planned 60,000-strong rapid reaction force would likely be ready for deployment to crisis regions by the end of the year .
in a joint declaration , the ministers said the eu was close to being prepared to handle crises running the full gamut of petersberg tasks - an outline of responsibilities for the force laid out during a summit held in a suburb of bonn , germany , in 1999 .
the agreement includes plans that range from dealing with humanitarian and rescue operations to keeping apart warring parties in conflict zones outside and inside europe .
the eu has already been approached by united nations secretary general kofi anan to send an eu force to support an emergency u.n. force in eastern congo , where fighting has left hundreds dead and thousands homeless and hungry .
" i have presented the demand to the ministers and in principle they have been positive , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters .
last month , the eu launched its first ever foray into joint peacekeeping by sending a 350-strong force to macedonia .
it is also considering taking the helm of a larger mission to bosnia , currently being managed by nato , next year .
force still lacks crucial capabilities despite the considerable momentum behind the project , the ministers conceded that the fledgling crisis management force still lacks vital and expensive military capabilities .
the force suffers from serious defense shortfalls that include transport aircraft , planes capable of air-to-air refueling and sufficient equipment to provide protection from chemical and biological attacks .
additionally , none of the 10 air-to-ground surveillance aircraft pledged by member states has yet materialized .

dw-world takes a look at teen music sensation , t.a.t.u. it 's been a while since we had something to look forward to at eurovision .
most years song contest fans are faced with out of tune euro-pop hits and hapless presenters struggling with a script delivered simultaneously in french , english and their native language .
but not this year .
no , this year eurovision has t.a.t.u.
the russian lesbian teen pop sensation who will represent their home country at this saturday 's contest in the latvian capital , riga , are odds-on favorites to win and give moscow the chance to host next year 's contest .
the bookies have even got good odds on the pair – - who say they are lovers – kissing on stage .
the duo , consisting of 17 year-old lena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova , have been hot property since they shot to fame across europe at the start of the year .
the band - whose name is a shortened form of the russian , " ta dyevushka lubit tu " – " this girl loves that one " - is managed by a former child psychologist and filmmaker , ivan shapovalov , who created the act in 1998 .
school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .

the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered . european union defense ministers meeting in brussels on monday reached an important milestone with the announcement that the eu ’ s planned 60,000-strong rapid reaction force would likely be ready for deployment to crisis regions by the end of the year .
in a joint declaration , the ministers said the eu was close to being prepared to handle crises running the full gamut of petersberg tasks - an outline of responsibilities for the force laid out during a summit held in a suburb of bonn , germany , in 1999 .
the agreement includes plans that range from dealing with humanitarian and rescue operations to keeping apart warring parties in conflict zones outside and inside europe .
the eu has already been approached by united nations secretary general kofi anan to send an eu force to support an emergency u.n. force in eastern congo , where fighting has left hundreds dead and thousands homeless and hungry .
" i have presented the demand to the ministers and in principle they have been positive , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters .
last month , the eu launched its first ever foray into joint peacekeeping by sending a 350-strong force to macedonia .
it is also considering taking the helm of a larger mission to bosnia , currently being managed by nato , next year .
force still lacks crucial capabilities despite the considerable momentum behind the project , the ministers conceded that the fledgling crisis management force still lacks vital and expensive military capabilities .
the force suffers from serious defense shortfalls that include transport aircraft , planes capable of air-to-air refueling and sufficient equipment to provide protection from chemical and biological attacks .
additionally , none of the 10 air-to-ground surveillance aircraft pledged by member states has yet materialized .
" these limitations and / or constraints are on deployment time and high risk ... in particular when conducting concurrent operations , " they said in the declaration .
the eu has less than six months to go before it is supposed to meet the " headline goal , " which envisages a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force that could be deployed within 60 days and remain on the ground for up to a year .
british defense minister geoff hoon said reaching such a goal was unlikely , pointing out that it took 70 days for britain to deploy 45,000 troops used in the war against iraq . " my message to colleagues today was that we still have a great deal more to do to meet the shortfalls in capacity , " hoon told reporters on monday .
" my message today was that they can ’ t put it in a box marked ‘ we ’ ve done that , ’ because they haven ’ t . "
even eu foreign policy chief javier solana made no bones about the enormity of the task facing the eu .
" it is hardly the time to rest on our laurels , " solana told ministers in brussels .
budget shortfalls in 2001 , the eu set up 19 expert panels to identify the biggest shortcomings that would have to be overcome in order to make the joint defense project a success and how to better pool the resources necessary to achieve that goal .
but the defense project has been badly hit with several countries lowering their defense budgets or letting them stagnate in the face of general belt-tightening .
" i don ’ t see signs that countries will increase budgets , " an eu military official told reuters on monday .
" so it ’ s a question of how willing they are , politically , to coordinate and get better output from what little they are prepared to spend . "
germany wants relaxed spending rules among the proposals on the board for rectifying the strained financial situation were efforts to forge a unified and lucrative eu defense industry .
but several countries also called for a loosening of the economic pact that ensures the stability of the euro , europe 's common currency .
germany , france and italy have called for relaxation of the eu ’ s strict public spending rules by excluding defense from overall expenditure and thus boosting europe ’ s military capabilities .
the three countries argued that military spending was being curtailed by the stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro by limiting public expenditure to below three percent of gross domestic product .
europe 's total annual defense spending amounts to just € 40 billion -lrb- $ 46.8 billion -rrb- contrasted with a u.s. military budget of $ 100 billion a year .
german defense minister peter struck , whose country is already in breach of the pact , said british criticism that eu defense ministers were failing to improve military capabilities or increase defense budget was completely justified .
struck said in brussels on monday that he was still aiming to increase defense spending in the near future .
germany 's current defense budget amounts to € 25 billion and accounts for 1.2 percent of german gdp according to struck .
military investments make up a quarter of the total defense budget .
the minister is likely to take up the matter with german finance minister eichel who remains determined to curtail the defense budget .
" that is a point , which has to be discussed further , " struck said in brussels .
berlin is also increasing its contribution to the eu rapid reaction force by 1,000 soldiers , thus increasing the german contingent to 33,000 troops .

warsaw has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for soldiers .
germany has said it will only send soldiers under a united nations mandate . poland has asked nato for help in filling out the 10,000-soldier security force it pledged to patrol parts of postwar iraq , germany 's defense minister confirmed to reporters during an eu defense ministers meeting monday . warsaw had said it was prepared to take over duties from british and american troops in one of three military sectors in iraq but lacked the troops for the job . the polish government has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for help .
poland can only supply 2,000 of the 10,000 troops needed for the reconstruction mission . italy , spain , denmark , the netherlands , bulgaria and the ukraine have already agreed to supply troops for the stability force which could be sent to the gulf at short notice .
still unclear is exactly who will provide the force its mandate . nato chiefs have said in the past they agree in principal to discuss the issue .
the united nations has not yet begun discussing the possibility publicly . german involvement unclear germany has maintiained that it will need a u.n. mandate before sending troops to postwar iraq .
german defense minister peter struck bristled earlier this month when informed poland wanted to make use of nato brigade comprising danish , german and polish troops for their postwar iraq duties . " i find it remarkable that poland and other countries are ready to take responsibility in iraq .
these countries know that for germany , any engagement in iraq is tied to u.n. involvement .
this is unforeseen as yet and , as such , it 's not something we have to consider , " struck told reporters . after talks described as " candid " with u.s. defense secretary colin powell last friday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was still hopeful for u.n. involvement in postwar iraq .
the two , however , said they had not discussed the possibility of using nato troops in securing the war-torn country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish peacekeeping proposal riles berlin berlin reacted frostily to a surprise proposal from poland that its soldiers team up with german and danish troops to keep the peace in postwar iraq .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .
also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .
bernhard may is a transatlantic specialist at the german council on foreign relations of course it 's good news for berlin in the sense that -lsb- powell -rsb- could have stayed at home or gone to a different city .
but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '
if it 's just a way of telling us europeans what we have to do then it will be very difficult .
radek sikorski is a former polish defense and foreign minister .
he is now executive director of the american enterprise institute 's new atlantic initiative in washington , d.c. the reading in washington is that germany has found itself in the position its in through a series of opportunistic political decisions and coincidences , but that fundamentally germany wishes to remain a u.s. ally .
france , on the other hand , has an alternative strategic vision .
france thinks germany should be the horse , the rest of europe should be the cart , and france would be driver .
and france would drive the horse and cart into a head-on collision with an american tank .
dagmar weiler is director of the bridge of understanding , a german-american nonprofit organization based in munich that organizes trips to germany for american jews .
i do n't think we should put too much emphasis on it .
it 's a start , that 's all .
the problems between the chancellor and the president will never be solved .
secondly it 's powell who 's coming , not the president .
when you do go to the u.s. and specifically to the heartland and you explain what germans think about the war and about the government , once they see that there 's more to it than simple anti-americanism as reported in the media , they are willing to come to germany and experience it firsthand .
i think we need to intensify that contact on the level of political foundations and institutions .
presidents and chancellors go , but we will always be here . jackson janes is executive director of the american insitute for contemporary german studies in washington , d.c. i think -lrb- in washington -rrb- there was this concern about germany and its relationship with france as part of the challenge to the us .
in the past , they have always tried to be a go-between and this time they took sides ...
they got themselves into a box with france , they did not have a profile and did not have a coherent position vis-a-vis the united states and they 're going to have to figure that out in the future .
powell is the one looked to by germans and europeans as someone who had an ear for their concerns , and to some extent that seems to be the case .
walther leisler kiep , member of the u.s.-friendly christian democratic union in germany and chairman emeritus of the transatlantic organization atlantik brücke .
the personal relationship between the chancellor and the president is a serious matter .
i think -lsb- this visit -rsb- is a matter which will certainly help in the direction of normalization .
several dates where they are all going to be meeting in the coming mothhs and that 's why this visit at this time is very important . i assure you that there is a wide view in germany among the people ... that everybody 's happy that the victory in iraq came so soon , everyone is happy that we got rid of saddam hussein .
that is clear .
on the other hand , this does not imply a change of vie or change in their opposition to the war . interviews conducted by andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit the dw-world dossier on the transatlantic relationship and powell 's trip to berlin radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered . european union defense ministers meeting in brussels on monday reached an important milestone with the announcement that the eu ’ s planned 60,000-strong rapid reaction force would likely be ready for deployment to crisis regions by the end of the year .
in a joint declaration , the ministers said the eu was close to being prepared to handle crises running the full gamut of petersberg tasks - an outline of responsibilities for the force laid out during a summit held in a suburb of bonn , germany , in 1999 .
the agreement includes plans that range from dealing with humanitarian and rescue operations to keeping apart warring parties in conflict zones outside and inside europe .
the eu has already been approached by united nations secretary general kofi anan to send an eu force to support an emergency u.n. force in eastern congo , where fighting has left hundreds dead and thousands homeless and hungry .
" i have presented the demand to the ministers and in principle they have been positive , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters .
last month , the eu launched its first ever foray into joint peacekeeping by sending a 350-strong force to macedonia .
it is also considering taking the helm of a larger mission to bosnia , currently being managed by nato , next year .
force still lacks crucial capabilities despite the considerable momentum behind the project , the ministers conceded that the fledgling crisis management force still lacks vital and expensive military capabilities .
the force suffers from serious defense shortfalls that include transport aircraft , planes capable of air-to-air refueling and sufficient equipment to provide protection from chemical and biological attacks .
additionally , none of the 10 air-to-ground surveillance aircraft pledged by member states has yet materialized .
" these limitations and / or constraints are on deployment time and high risk ... in particular when conducting concurrent operations , " they said in the declaration .
the eu has less than six months to go before it is supposed to meet the " headline goal , " which envisages a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force that could be deployed within 60 days and remain on the ground for up to a year .
british defense minister geoff hoon said reaching such a goal was unlikely , pointing out that it took 70 days for britain to deploy 45,000 troops used in the war against iraq . " my message to colleagues today was that we still have a great deal more to do to meet the shortfalls in capacity , " hoon told reporters on monday .
" my message today was that they can ’ t put it in a box marked ‘ we ’ ve done that , ’ because they haven ’ t . "
even eu foreign policy chief javier solana made no bones about the enormity of the task facing the eu .
" it is hardly the time to rest on our laurels , " solana told ministers in brussels .
budget shortfalls in 2001 , the eu set up 19 expert panels to identify the biggest shortcomings that would have to be overcome in order to make the joint defense project a success and how to better pool the resources necessary to achieve that goal .
but the defense project has been badly hit with several countries lowering their defense budgets or letting them stagnate in the face of general belt-tightening .
" i don ’ t see signs that countries will increase budgets , " an eu military official told reuters on monday .
" so it ’ s a question of how willing they are , politically , to coordinate and get better output from what little they are prepared to spend . "
germany wants relaxed spending rules among the proposals on the board for rectifying the strained financial situation were efforts to forge a unified and lucrative eu defense industry .
but several countries also called for a loosening of the economic pact that ensures the stability of the euro , europe 's common currency .
germany , france and italy have called for relaxation of the eu ’ s strict public spending rules by excluding defense from overall expenditure and thus boosting europe ’ s military capabilities .
the three countries argued that military spending was being curtailed by the stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro by limiting public expenditure to below three percent of gross domestic product .
europe 's total annual defense spending amounts to just € 40 billion -lrb- $ 46.8 billion -rrb- contrasted with a u.s. military budget of $ 100 billion a year .
german defense minister peter struck , whose country is already in breach of the pact , said british criticism that eu defense ministers were failing to improve military capabilities or increase defense budget was completely justified .
struck said in brussels on monday that he was still aiming to increase defense spending in the near future .
germany 's current defense budget amounts to € 25 billion and accounts for 1.2 percent of german gdp according to struck .
military investments make up a quarter of the total defense budget .
the minister is likely to take up the matter with german finance minister eichel who remains determined to curtail the defense budget .
" that is a point , which has to be discussed further , " struck said in brussels .
berlin is also increasing its contribution to the eu rapid reaction force by 1,000 soldiers , thus increasing the german contingent to 33,000 troops .

dw-world takes a look at teen music sensation , t.a.t.u. it 's been a while since we had something to look forward to at eurovision .
most years song contest fans are faced with out of tune euro-pop hits and hapless presenters struggling with a script delivered simultaneously in french , english and their native language .
but not this year .
no , this year eurovision has t.a.t.u.
the russian lesbian teen pop sensation who will represent their home country at this saturday 's contest in the latvian capital , riga , are odds-on favorites to win and give moscow the chance to host next year 's contest .
the bookies have even got good odds on the pair – - who say they are lovers – kissing on stage .
the duo , consisting of 17 year-old lena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova , have been hot property since they shot to fame across europe at the start of the year .
the band - whose name is a shortened form of the russian , " ta dyevushka lubit tu " – " this girl loves that one " - is managed by a former child psychologist and filmmaker , ivan shapovalov , who created the act in 1998 .
school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .
rumors over the credibility and motives of the band ’ s manager , who supposedly came up with the idea of an underage lesbian band to attract scandal-seeking media attention , have also surfaced in recent weeks , dampening the girls ’ rebellious image .
cashing in on scandal but with odds of 9-2 , t.a.t.u is still a favorite to win eurovision this year .
unofficial fan sites for the pair are rallying viewers by posting instructions on how to vote for the pair .
and no matter what happens on saturday , eurovision organizers are preparing for all eventualities .
" we do n't know what they 'll do on stage – you never do with this group , " eurovision spokesperson sovita vevere told reuters .
" but we will have a taped performance from the dress rehearsal , so we can always switch to that if we need to . "
bad news for those who have put a bet on the two having a snog on stage .
" obviously the kiss has to be seen on tv , otherwise we ca n't pay out , " ladbrookes betting spokesman , warren lush told dw-world . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " let 's get happy " goes to eurovision germany 's representative at this year 's eurovision song contest , the annual celebration of all things musical , tacky and european , will be " let 's get happy " sung by lou hoffner -lrb- march 9 , 2003 -rrb- .

dw-world takes a look at teen music sensation , t.a.t.u. it 's been a while since we had something to look forward to at eurovision .
most years song contest fans are faced with out of tune euro-pop hits and hapless presenters struggling with a script delivered simultaneously in french , english and their native language .
but not this year .
no , this year eurovision has t.a.t.u.
the russian lesbian teen pop sensation who will represent their home country at this saturday 's contest in the latvian capital , riga , are odds-on favorites to win and give moscow the chance to host next year 's contest .
the bookies have even got good odds on the pair – - who say they are lovers – kissing on stage .
the duo , consisting of 17 year-old lena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova , have been hot property since they shot to fame across europe at the start of the year .
the band - whose name is a shortened form of the russian , " ta dyevushka lubit tu " – " this girl loves that one " - is managed by a former child psychologist and filmmaker , ivan shapovalov , who created the act in 1998 .
school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .
rumors over the credibility and motives of the band ’ s manager , who supposedly came up with the idea of an underage lesbian band to attract scandal-seeking media attention , have also surfaced in recent weeks , dampening the girls ’ rebellious image .
cashing in on scandal but with odds of 9-2 , t.a.t.u is still a favorite to win eurovision this year .
unofficial fan sites for the pair are rallying viewers by posting instructions on how to vote for the pair .
and no matter what happens on saturday , eurovision organizers are preparing for all eventualities .

warsaw has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for soldiers .
germany has said it will only send soldiers under a united nations mandate . poland has asked nato for help in filling out the 10,000-soldier security force it pledged to patrol parts of postwar iraq , germany 's defense minister confirmed to reporters during an eu defense ministers meeting monday . warsaw had said it was prepared to take over duties from british and american troops in one of three military sectors in iraq but lacked the troops for the job . the polish government has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for help .
poland can only supply 2,000 of the 10,000 troops needed for the reconstruction mission . italy , spain , denmark , the netherlands , bulgaria and the ukraine have already agreed to supply troops for the stability force which could be sent to the gulf at short notice .
still unclear is exactly who will provide the force its mandate . nato chiefs have said in the past they agree in principal to discuss the issue .
the united nations has not yet begun discussing the possibility publicly . german involvement unclear germany has maintiained that it will need a u.n. mandate before sending troops to postwar iraq .
german defense minister peter struck bristled earlier this month when informed poland wanted to make use of nato brigade comprising danish , german and polish troops for their postwar iraq duties . " i find it remarkable that poland and other countries are ready to take responsibility in iraq .
these countries know that for germany , any engagement in iraq is tied to u.n. involvement .
this is unforeseen as yet and , as such , it 's not something we have to consider , " struck told reporters . after talks described as " candid " with u.s. defense secretary colin powell last friday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was still hopeful for u.n. involvement in postwar iraq .
the two , however , said they had not discussed the possibility of using nato troops in securing the war-torn country . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de polish peacekeeping proposal riles berlin berlin reacted frostily to a surprise proposal from poland that its soldiers team up with german and danish troops to keep the peace in postwar iraq .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .
also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .
bernhard may is a transatlantic specialist at the german council on foreign relations of course it 's good news for berlin in the sense that -lsb- powell -rsb- could have stayed at home or gone to a different city .
but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '
if it 's just a way of telling us europeans what we have to do then it will be very difficult .
radek sikorski is a former polish defense and foreign minister .
he is now executive director of the american enterprise institute 's new atlantic initiative in washington , d.c. the reading in washington is that germany has found itself in the position its in through a series of opportunistic political decisions and coincidences , but that fundamentally germany wishes to remain a u.s. ally .
france , on the other hand , has an alternative strategic vision .

dagmar weiler is director of the bridge of understanding , a german-american nonprofit organization based in munich that organizes trips to germany for american jews .
i do n't think we should put too much emphasis on it .
it 's a start , that 's all .
the problems between the chancellor and the president will never be solved .
secondly it 's powell who 's coming , not the president .
when you do go to the u.s. and specifically to the heartland and you explain what germans think about the war and about the government , once they see that there 's more to it than simple anti-americanism as reported in the media , they are willing to come to germany and experience it firsthand .
i think we need to intensify that contact on the level of political foundations and institutions .

the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered . european union defense ministers meeting in brussels on monday reached an important milestone with the announcement that the eu ’ s planned 60,000-strong rapid reaction force would likely be ready for deployment to crisis regions by the end of the year .
in a joint declaration , the ministers said the eu was close to being prepared to handle crises running the full gamut of petersberg tasks - an outline of responsibilities for the force laid out during a summit held in a suburb of bonn , germany , in 1999 .
the agreement includes plans that range from dealing with humanitarian and rescue operations to keeping apart warring parties in conflict zones outside and inside europe .
the eu has already been approached by united nations secretary general kofi anan to send an eu force to support an emergency u.n. force in eastern congo , where fighting has left hundreds dead and thousands homeless and hungry .
" i have presented the demand to the ministers and in principle they have been positive , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters .
last month , the eu launched its first ever foray into joint peacekeeping by sending a 350-strong force to macedonia .
it is also considering taking the helm of a larger mission to bosnia , currently being managed by nato , next year .
force still lacks crucial capabilities despite the considerable momentum behind the project , the ministers conceded that the fledgling crisis management force still lacks vital and expensive military capabilities .
the force suffers from serious defense shortfalls that include transport aircraft , planes capable of air-to-air refueling and sufficient equipment to provide protection from chemical and biological attacks .
additionally , none of the 10 air-to-ground surveillance aircraft pledged by member states has yet materialized .
" these limitations and / or constraints are on deployment time and high risk ... in particular when conducting concurrent operations , " they said in the declaration .
the eu has less than six months to go before it is supposed to meet the " headline goal , " which envisages a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force that could be deployed within 60 days and remain on the ground for up to a year .
british defense minister geoff hoon said reaching such a goal was unlikely , pointing out that it took 70 days for britain to deploy 45,000 troops used in the war against iraq . " my message to colleagues today was that we still have a great deal more to do to meet the shortfalls in capacity , " hoon told reporters on monday .
" my message today was that they can ’ t put it in a box marked ‘ we ’ ve done that , ’ because they haven ’ t . "
even eu foreign policy chief javier solana made no bones about the enormity of the task facing the eu .
" it is hardly the time to rest on our laurels , " solana told ministers in brussels .
budget shortfalls in 2001 , the eu set up 19 expert panels to identify the biggest shortcomings that would have to be overcome in order to make the joint defense project a success and how to better pool the resources necessary to achieve that goal .
but the defense project has been badly hit with several countries lowering their defense budgets or letting them stagnate in the face of general belt-tightening .
" i don ’ t see signs that countries will increase budgets , " an eu military official told reuters on monday .
" so it ’ s a question of how willing they are , politically , to coordinate and get better output from what little they are prepared to spend . "
germany wants relaxed spending rules among the proposals on the board for rectifying the strained financial situation were efforts to forge a unified and lucrative eu defense industry .
but several countries also called for a loosening of the economic pact that ensures the stability of the euro , europe 's common currency .
germany , france and italy have called for relaxation of the eu ’ s strict public spending rules by excluding defense from overall expenditure and thus boosting europe ’ s military capabilities .
the three countries argued that military spending was being curtailed by the stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro by limiting public expenditure to below three percent of gross domestic product .
europe 's total annual defense spending amounts to just € 40 billion -lrb- $ 46.8 billion -rrb- contrasted with a u.s. military budget of $ 100 billion a year .
german defense minister peter struck , whose country is already in breach of the pact , said british criticism that eu defense ministers were failing to improve military capabilities or increase defense budget was completely justified .
struck said in brussels on monday that he was still aiming to increase defense spending in the near future .
germany 's current defense budget amounts to € 25 billion and accounts for 1.2 percent of german gdp according to struck .
military investments make up a quarter of the total defense budget .
the minister is likely to take up the matter with german finance minister eichel who remains determined to curtail the defense budget .
" that is a point , which has to be discussed further , " struck said in brussels .
berlin is also increasing its contribution to the eu rapid reaction force by 1,000 soldiers , thus increasing the german contingent to 33,000 troops .

dw-world takes a look at teen music sensation , t.a.t.u. it 's been a while since we had something to look forward to at eurovision .
most years song contest fans are faced with out of tune euro-pop hits and hapless presenters struggling with a script delivered simultaneously in french , english and their native language .
but not this year .
no , this year eurovision has t.a.t.u.
the russian lesbian teen pop sensation who will represent their home country at this saturday 's contest in the latvian capital , riga , are odds-on favorites to win and give moscow the chance to host next year 's contest .
the bookies have even got good odds on the pair – - who say they are lovers – kissing on stage .
the duo , consisting of 17 year-old lena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova , have been hot property since they shot to fame across europe at the start of the year .
the band - whose name is a shortened form of the russian , " ta dyevushka lubit tu " – " this girl loves that one " - is managed by a former child psychologist and filmmaker , ivan shapovalov , who created the act in 1998 .
school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .
rumors over the credibility and motives of the band ’ s manager , who supposedly came up with the idea of an underage lesbian band to attract scandal-seeking media attention , have also surfaced in recent weeks , dampening the girls ’ rebellious image .
cashing in on scandal but with odds of 9-2 , t.a.t.u is still a favorite to win eurovision this year .
unofficial fan sites for the pair are rallying viewers by posting instructions on how to vote for the pair .
and no matter what happens on saturday , eurovision organizers are preparing for all eventualities .
" we do n't know what they 'll do on stage – you never do with this group , " eurovision spokesperson sovita vevere told reuters .
" but we will have a taped performance from the dress rehearsal , so we can always switch to that if we need to . "
bad news for those who have put a bet on the two having a snog on stage .
" obviously the kiss has to be seen on tv , otherwise we ca n't pay out , " ladbrookes betting spokesman , warren lush told dw-world . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " let 's get happy " goes to eurovision germany 's representative at this year 's eurovision song contest , the annual celebration of all things musical , tacky and european , will be " let 's get happy " sung by lou hoffner -lrb- march 9 , 2003 -rrb- .

the bookies have even got good odds on the pair – - who say they are lovers – kissing on stage .
the duo , consisting of 17 year-old lena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova , have been hot property since they shot to fame across europe at the start of the year .
the band - whose name is a shortened form of the russian , " ta dyevushka lubit tu " – " this girl loves that one " - is managed by a former child psychologist and filmmaker , ivan shapovalov , who created the act in 1998 .
school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .
rumors over the credibility and motives of the band ’ s manager , who supposedly came up with the idea of an underage lesbian band to attract scandal-seeking media attention , have also surfaced in recent weeks , dampening the girls ’ rebellious image .
cashing in on scandal but with odds of 9-2 , t.a.t.u is still a favorite to win eurovision this year .
unofficial fan sites for the pair are rallying viewers by posting instructions on how to vote for the pair .
and no matter what happens on saturday , eurovision organizers are preparing for all eventualities .
" we do n't know what they 'll do on stage – you never do with this group , " eurovision spokesperson sovita vevere told reuters .
" but we will have a taped performance from the dress rehearsal , so we can always switch to that if we need to . "
bad news for those who have put a bet on the two having a snog on stage .
" obviously the kiss has to be seen on tv , otherwise we ca n't pay out , " ladbrookes betting spokesman , warren lush told dw-world . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " let 's get happy " goes to eurovision germany 's representative at this year 's eurovision song contest , the annual celebration of all things musical , tacky and european , will be " let 's get happy " sung by lou hoffner -lrb- march 9 , 2003 -rrb- .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .
also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .
bernhard may is a transatlantic specialist at the german council on foreign relations of course it 's good news for berlin in the sense that -lsb- powell -rsb- could have stayed at home or gone to a different city .
but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '
if it 's just a way of telling us europeans what we have to do then it will be very difficult .
radek sikorski is a former polish defense and foreign minister .
he is now executive director of the american enterprise institute 's new atlantic initiative in washington , d.c. the reading in washington is that germany has found itself in the position its in through a series of opportunistic political decisions and coincidences , but that fundamentally germany wishes to remain a u.s. ally .
france , on the other hand , has an alternative strategic vision .
france thinks germany should be the horse , the rest of europe should be the cart , and france would be driver .
and france would drive the horse and cart into a head-on collision with an american tank .
dagmar weiler is director of the bridge of understanding , a german-american nonprofit organization based in munich that organizes trips to germany for american jews .
i do n't think we should put too much emphasis on it .
it 's a start , that 's all .
the problems between the chancellor and the president will never be solved .
secondly it 's powell who 's coming , not the president .
when you do go to the u.s. and specifically to the heartland and you explain what germans think about the war and about the government , once they see that there 's more to it than simple anti-americanism as reported in the media , they are willing to come to germany and experience it firsthand .
i think we need to intensify that contact on the level of political foundations and institutions .
presidents and chancellors go , but we will always be here . jackson janes is executive director of the american insitute for contemporary german studies in washington , d.c. i think -lrb- in washington -rrb- there was this concern about germany and its relationship with france as part of the challenge to the us .
in the past , they have always tried to be a go-between and this time they took sides ...
they got themselves into a box with france , they did not have a profile and did not have a coherent position vis-a-vis the united states and they 're going to have to figure that out in the future .
powell is the one looked to by germans and europeans as someone who had an ear for their concerns , and to some extent that seems to be the case .
walther leisler kiep , member of the u.s.-friendly christian democratic union in germany and chairman emeritus of the transatlantic organization atlantik brücke .
the personal relationship between the chancellor and the president is a serious matter .
i think -lsb- this visit -rsb- is a matter which will certainly help in the direction of normalization .
several dates where they are all going to be meeting in the coming mothhs and that 's why this visit at this time is very important . i assure you that there is a wide view in germany among the people ... that everybody 's happy that the victory in iraq came so soon , everyone is happy that we got rid of saddam hussein .
that is clear .
on the other hand , this does not imply a change of vie or change in their opposition to the war . interviews conducted by andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit the dw-world dossier on the transatlantic relationship and powell 's trip to berlin 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .
also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .
bernhard may is a transatlantic specialist at the german council on foreign relations of course it 's good news for berlin in the sense that -lsb- powell -rsb- could have stayed at home or gone to a different city .
but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '
if it 's just a way of telling us europeans what we have to do then it will be very difficult .
radek sikorski is a former polish defense and foreign minister .
he is now executive director of the american enterprise institute 's new atlantic initiative in washington , d.c. the reading in washington is that germany has found itself in the position its in through a series of opportunistic political decisions and coincidences , but that fundamentally germany wishes to remain a u.s. ally .
france , on the other hand , has an alternative strategic vision .
france thinks germany should be the horse , the rest of europe should be the cart , and france would be driver .

i do n't think we should put too much emphasis on it .
it 's a start , that 's all .
the problems between the chancellor and the president will never be solved .
secondly it 's powell who 's coming , not the president .
when you do go to the u.s. and specifically to the heartland and you explain what germans think about the war and about the government , once they see that there 's more to it than simple anti-americanism as reported in the media , they are willing to come to germany and experience it firsthand .

in the past , they have always tried to be a go-between and this time they took sides ...
they got themselves into a box with france , they did not have a profile and did not have a coherent position vis-a-vis the united states and they 're going to have to figure that out in the future .

this is unforeseen as yet and , as such , it 's not something we have to consider , " struck told reporters . after talks described as " candid " with u.s. defense secretary colin powell last friday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was still hopeful for u.n. involvement in postwar iraq .

the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered . european union defense ministers meeting in brussels on monday reached an important milestone with the announcement that the eu ’ s planned 60,000-strong rapid reaction force would likely be ready for deployment to crisis regions by the end of the year .
in a joint declaration , the ministers said the eu was close to being prepared to handle crises running the full gamut of petersberg tasks - an outline of responsibilities for the force laid out during a summit held in a suburb of bonn , germany , in 1999 .
the agreement includes plans that range from dealing with humanitarian and rescue operations to keeping apart warring parties in conflict zones outside and inside europe .
the eu has already been approached by united nations secretary general kofi anan to send an eu force to support an emergency u.n. force in eastern congo , where fighting has left hundreds dead and thousands homeless and hungry .
" i have presented the demand to the ministers and in principle they have been positive , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters .
last month , the eu launched its first ever foray into joint peacekeeping by sending a 350-strong force to macedonia .
it is also considering taking the helm of a larger mission to bosnia , currently being managed by nato , next year .
force still lacks crucial capabilities despite the considerable momentum behind the project , the ministers conceded that the fledgling crisis management force still lacks vital and expensive military capabilities .
the force suffers from serious defense shortfalls that include transport aircraft , planes capable of air-to-air refueling and sufficient equipment to provide protection from chemical and biological attacks .
additionally , none of the 10 air-to-ground surveillance aircraft pledged by member states has yet materialized .
" these limitations and / or constraints are on deployment time and high risk ... in particular when conducting concurrent operations , " they said in the declaration .
the eu has less than six months to go before it is supposed to meet the " headline goal , " which envisages a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force that could be deployed within 60 days and remain on the ground for up to a year .
british defense minister geoff hoon said reaching such a goal was unlikely , pointing out that it took 70 days for britain to deploy 45,000 troops used in the war against iraq . " my message to colleagues today was that we still have a great deal more to do to meet the shortfalls in capacity , " hoon told reporters on monday .
" my message today was that they can ’ t put it in a box marked ‘ we ’ ve done that , ’ because they haven ’ t . "
even eu foreign policy chief javier solana made no bones about the enormity of the task facing the eu .
" it is hardly the time to rest on our laurels , " solana told ministers in brussels .
budget shortfalls in 2001 , the eu set up 19 expert panels to identify the biggest shortcomings that would have to be overcome in order to make the joint defense project a success and how to better pool the resources necessary to achieve that goal .
but the defense project has been badly hit with several countries lowering their defense budgets or letting them stagnate in the face of general belt-tightening .
" i don ’ t see signs that countries will increase budgets , " an eu military official told reuters on monday .
" so it ’ s a question of how willing they are , politically , to coordinate and get better output from what little they are prepared to spend . "
germany wants relaxed spending rules among the proposals on the board for rectifying the strained financial situation were efforts to forge a unified and lucrative eu defense industry .
but several countries also called for a loosening of the economic pact that ensures the stability of the euro , europe 's common currency .
germany , france and italy have called for relaxation of the eu ’ s strict public spending rules by excluding defense from overall expenditure and thus boosting europe ’ s military capabilities .
the three countries argued that military spending was being curtailed by the stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro by limiting public expenditure to below three percent of gross domestic product .
europe 's total annual defense spending amounts to just € 40 billion -lrb- $ 46.8 billion -rrb- contrasted with a u.s. military budget of $ 100 billion a year .
german defense minister peter struck , whose country is already in breach of the pact , said british criticism that eu defense ministers were failing to improve military capabilities or increase defense budget was completely justified .
struck said in brussels on monday that he was still aiming to increase defense spending in the near future .
germany 's current defense budget amounts to € 25 billion and accounts for 1.2 percent of german gdp according to struck .
military investments make up a quarter of the total defense budget .
the minister is likely to take up the matter with german finance minister eichel who remains determined to curtail the defense budget .
" that is a point , which has to be discussed further , " struck said in brussels .
berlin is also increasing its contribution to the eu rapid reaction force by 1,000 soldiers , thus increasing the german contingent to 33,000 troops .

the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered . european union defense ministers meeting in brussels on monday reached an important milestone with the announcement that the eu ’ s planned 60,000-strong rapid reaction force would likely be ready for deployment to crisis regions by the end of the year .
in a joint declaration , the ministers said the eu was close to being prepared to handle crises running the full gamut of petersberg tasks - an outline of responsibilities for the force laid out during a summit held in a suburb of bonn , germany , in 1999 .
the agreement includes plans that range from dealing with humanitarian and rescue operations to keeping apart warring parties in conflict zones outside and inside europe .
the eu has already been approached by united nations secretary general kofi anan to send an eu force to support an emergency u.n. force in eastern congo , where fighting has left hundreds dead and thousands homeless and hungry .
" i have presented the demand to the ministers and in principle they have been positive , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters .
last month , the eu launched its first ever foray into joint peacekeeping by sending a 350-strong force to macedonia .
it is also considering taking the helm of a larger mission to bosnia , currently being managed by nato , next year .
force still lacks crucial capabilities despite the considerable momentum behind the project , the ministers conceded that the fledgling crisis management force still lacks vital and expensive military capabilities .
the force suffers from serious defense shortfalls that include transport aircraft , planes capable of air-to-air refueling and sufficient equipment to provide protection from chemical and biological attacks .
additionally , none of the 10 air-to-ground surveillance aircraft pledged by member states has yet materialized .
" these limitations and / or constraints are on deployment time and high risk ... in particular when conducting concurrent operations , " they said in the declaration .
the eu has less than six months to go before it is supposed to meet the " headline goal , " which envisages a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force that could be deployed within 60 days and remain on the ground for up to a year .
british defense minister geoff hoon said reaching such a goal was unlikely , pointing out that it took 70 days for britain to deploy 45,000 troops used in the war against iraq . " my message to colleagues today was that we still have a great deal more to do to meet the shortfalls in capacity , " hoon told reporters on monday .
" my message today was that they can ’ t put it in a box marked ‘ we ’ ve done that , ’ because they haven ’ t . "
even eu foreign policy chief javier solana made no bones about the enormity of the task facing the eu .
" it is hardly the time to rest on our laurels , " solana told ministers in brussels .
budget shortfalls in 2001 , the eu set up 19 expert panels to identify the biggest shortcomings that would have to be overcome in order to make the joint defense project a success and how to better pool the resources necessary to achieve that goal .
but the defense project has been badly hit with several countries lowering their defense budgets or letting them stagnate in the face of general belt-tightening .
" i don ’ t see signs that countries will increase budgets , " an eu military official told reuters on monday .
" so it ’ s a question of how willing they are , politically , to coordinate and get better output from what little they are prepared to spend . "
germany wants relaxed spending rules among the proposals on the board for rectifying the strained financial situation were efforts to forge a unified and lucrative eu defense industry .
but several countries also called for a loosening of the economic pact that ensures the stability of the euro , europe 's common currency .
germany , france and italy have called for relaxation of the eu ’ s strict public spending rules by excluding defense from overall expenditure and thus boosting europe ’ s military capabilities .
the three countries argued that military spending was being curtailed by the stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro by limiting public expenditure to below three percent of gross domestic product .
europe 's total annual defense spending amounts to just € 40 billion -lrb- $ 46.8 billion -rrb- contrasted with a u.s. military budget of $ 100 billion a year .
german defense minister peter struck , whose country is already in breach of the pact , said british criticism that eu defense ministers were failing to improve military capabilities or increase defense budget was completely justified .
struck said in brussels on monday that he was still aiming to increase defense spending in the near future .
germany 's current defense budget amounts to € 25 billion and accounts for 1.2 percent of german gdp according to struck .
military investments make up a quarter of the total defense budget .
the minister is likely to take up the matter with german finance minister eichel who remains determined to curtail the defense budget .
" that is a point , which has to be discussed further , " struck said in brussels .
berlin is also increasing its contribution to the eu rapid reaction force by 1,000 soldiers , thus increasing the german contingent to 33,000 troops .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .
also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .
bernhard may is a transatlantic specialist at the german council on foreign relations of course it 's good news for berlin in the sense that -lsb- powell -rsb- could have stayed at home or gone to a different city .
but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '
if it 's just a way of telling us europeans what we have to do then it will be very difficult .
radek sikorski is a former polish defense and foreign minister .
he is now executive director of the american enterprise institute 's new atlantic initiative in washington , d.c. the reading in washington is that germany has found itself in the position its in through a series of opportunistic political decisions and coincidences , but that fundamentally germany wishes to remain a u.s. ally .
france , on the other hand , has an alternative strategic vision .
france thinks germany should be the horse , the rest of europe should be the cart , and france would be driver .
and france would drive the horse and cart into a head-on collision with an american tank .
dagmar weiler is director of the bridge of understanding , a german-american nonprofit organization based in munich that organizes trips to germany for american jews .
i do n't think we should put too much emphasis on it .
it 's a start , that 's all .
the problems between the chancellor and the president will never be solved .
secondly it 's powell who 's coming , not the president .
when you do go to the u.s. and specifically to the heartland and you explain what germans think about the war and about the government , once they see that there 's more to it than simple anti-americanism as reported in the media , they are willing to come to germany and experience it firsthand .
i think we need to intensify that contact on the level of political foundations and institutions .
presidents and chancellors go , but we will always be here . jackson janes is executive director of the american insitute for contemporary german studies in washington , d.c. i think -lrb- in washington -rrb- there was this concern about germany and its relationship with france as part of the challenge to the us .
in the past , they have always tried to be a go-between and this time they took sides ...
they got themselves into a box with france , they did not have a profile and did not have a coherent position vis-a-vis the united states and they 're going to have to figure that out in the future .
powell is the one looked to by germans and europeans as someone who had an ear for their concerns , and to some extent that seems to be the case .
walther leisler kiep , member of the u.s.-friendly christian democratic union in germany and chairman emeritus of the transatlantic organization atlantik brücke .
the personal relationship between the chancellor and the president is a serious matter .
i think -lsb- this visit -rsb- is a matter which will certainly help in the direction of normalization .
several dates where they are all going to be meeting in the coming mothhs and that 's why this visit at this time is very important . i assure you that there is a wide view in germany among the people ... that everybody 's happy that the victory in iraq came so soon , everyone is happy that we got rid of saddam hussein .
that is clear .
on the other hand , this does not imply a change of vie or change in their opposition to the war . interviews conducted by andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the powell visit the dw-world dossier on the transatlantic relationship and powell 's trip to berlin 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

also likely to be on the agenda is the position germany will take in the united nations security council on the future of postwar iraq .
the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .
germany 's position on the resolution as well as their role in the reconstruction of iraq are likely to be of great interest to the bush administration . below , a round-up of expert commentary on the problems in u.s. and german relations , the german-french alliance , the powell visit and what the near future holds .

but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '

warsaw has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for soldiers .
germany has said it will only send soldiers under a united nations mandate . poland has asked nato for help in filling out the 10,000-soldier security force it pledged to patrol parts of postwar iraq , germany 's defense minister confirmed to reporters during an eu defense ministers meeting monday . warsaw had said it was prepared to take over duties from british and american troops in one of three military sectors in iraq but lacked the troops for the job . the polish government has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for help .
poland can only supply 2,000 of the 10,000 troops needed for the reconstruction mission . italy , spain , denmark , the netherlands , bulgaria and the ukraine have already agreed to supply troops for the stability force which could be sent to the gulf at short notice .

the united nations has not yet begun discussing the possibility publicly . german involvement unclear germany has maintiained that it will need a u.n. mandate before sending troops to postwar iraq .
german defense minister peter struck bristled earlier this month when informed poland wanted to make use of nato brigade comprising danish , german and polish troops for their postwar iraq duties . " i find it remarkable that poland and other countries are ready to take responsibility in iraq .
these countries know that for germany , any engagement in iraq is tied to u.n. involvement .
this is unforeseen as yet and , as such , it 's not something we have to consider , " struck told reporters . after talks described as " candid " with u.s. defense secretary colin powell last friday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was still hopeful for u.n. involvement in postwar iraq .

the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered . european union defense ministers meeting in brussels on monday reached an important milestone with the announcement that the eu ’ s planned 60,000-strong rapid reaction force would likely be ready for deployment to crisis regions by the end of the year .
in a joint declaration , the ministers said the eu was close to being prepared to handle crises running the full gamut of petersberg tasks - an outline of responsibilities for the force laid out during a summit held in a suburb of bonn , germany , in 1999 .
the agreement includes plans that range from dealing with humanitarian and rescue operations to keeping apart warring parties in conflict zones outside and inside europe .
the eu has already been approached by united nations secretary general kofi anan to send an eu force to support an emergency u.n. force in eastern congo , where fighting has left hundreds dead and thousands homeless and hungry .
" i have presented the demand to the ministers and in principle they have been positive , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters .
last month , the eu launched its first ever foray into joint peacekeeping by sending a 350-strong force to macedonia .
it is also considering taking the helm of a larger mission to bosnia , currently being managed by nato , next year .
force still lacks crucial capabilities despite the considerable momentum behind the project , the ministers conceded that the fledgling crisis management force still lacks vital and expensive military capabilities .
the force suffers from serious defense shortfalls that include transport aircraft , planes capable of air-to-air refueling and sufficient equipment to provide protection from chemical and biological attacks .
additionally , none of the 10 air-to-ground surveillance aircraft pledged by member states has yet materialized .
" these limitations and / or constraints are on deployment time and high risk ... in particular when conducting concurrent operations , " they said in the declaration .
the eu has less than six months to go before it is supposed to meet the " headline goal , " which envisages a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force that could be deployed within 60 days and remain on the ground for up to a year .
british defense minister geoff hoon said reaching such a goal was unlikely , pointing out that it took 70 days for britain to deploy 45,000 troops used in the war against iraq . " my message to colleagues today was that we still have a great deal more to do to meet the shortfalls in capacity , " hoon told reporters on monday .
" my message today was that they can ’ t put it in a box marked ‘ we ’ ve done that , ’ because they haven ’ t . "
even eu foreign policy chief javier solana made no bones about the enormity of the task facing the eu .
" it is hardly the time to rest on our laurels , " solana told ministers in brussels .
budget shortfalls in 2001 , the eu set up 19 expert panels to identify the biggest shortcomings that would have to be overcome in order to make the joint defense project a success and how to better pool the resources necessary to achieve that goal .
but the defense project has been badly hit with several countries lowering their defense budgets or letting them stagnate in the face of general belt-tightening .
" i don ’ t see signs that countries will increase budgets , " an eu military official told reuters on monday .
" so it ’ s a question of how willing they are , politically , to coordinate and get better output from what little they are prepared to spend . "
germany wants relaxed spending rules among the proposals on the board for rectifying the strained financial situation were efforts to forge a unified and lucrative eu defense industry .
but several countries also called for a loosening of the economic pact that ensures the stability of the euro , europe 's common currency .
germany , france and italy have called for relaxation of the eu ’ s strict public spending rules by excluding defense from overall expenditure and thus boosting europe ’ s military capabilities .
the three countries argued that military spending was being curtailed by the stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro by limiting public expenditure to below three percent of gross domestic product .
europe 's total annual defense spending amounts to just € 40 billion -lrb- $ 46.8 billion -rrb- contrasted with a u.s. military budget of $ 100 billion a year .
german defense minister peter struck , whose country is already in breach of the pact , said british criticism that eu defense ministers were failing to improve military capabilities or increase defense budget was completely justified .
struck said in brussels on monday that he was still aiming to increase defense spending in the near future .
germany 's current defense budget amounts to € 25 billion and accounts for 1.2 percent of german gdp according to struck .
military investments make up a quarter of the total defense budget .
the minister is likely to take up the matter with german finance minister eichel who remains determined to curtail the defense budget .
" that is a point , which has to be discussed further , " struck said in brussels .
berlin is also increasing its contribution to the eu rapid reaction force by 1,000 soldiers , thus increasing the german contingent to 33,000 troops .

european union defense officials say their rapid reaction force can be deployable within a year .
but the u.s. and great britain want europe 's soldiers to serve nato , not the eu .

the eu has declared its fledgling rapid reaction force will be ready for peacekeeping missions by the end of the year .
a deployment to eastern congo under a u.n. mandate is being considered . european union defense ministers meeting in brussels on monday reached an important milestone with the announcement that the eu ’ s planned 60,000-strong rapid reaction force would likely be ready for deployment to crisis regions by the end of the year .
in a joint declaration , the ministers said the eu was close to being prepared to handle crises running the full gamut of petersberg tasks - an outline of responsibilities for the force laid out during a summit held in a suburb of bonn , germany , in 1999 .
the agreement includes plans that range from dealing with humanitarian and rescue operations to keeping apart warring parties in conflict zones outside and inside europe .
the eu has already been approached by united nations secretary general kofi anan to send an eu force to support an emergency u.n. force in eastern congo , where fighting has left hundreds dead and thousands homeless and hungry .
" i have presented the demand to the ministers and in principle they have been positive , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told reporters .
last month , the eu launched its first ever foray into joint peacekeeping by sending a 350-strong force to macedonia .
it is also considering taking the helm of a larger mission to bosnia , currently being managed by nato , next year .
force still lacks crucial capabilities despite the considerable momentum behind the project , the ministers conceded that the fledgling crisis management force still lacks vital and expensive military capabilities .
the force suffers from serious defense shortfalls that include transport aircraft , planes capable of air-to-air refueling and sufficient equipment to provide protection from chemical and biological attacks .
additionally , none of the 10 air-to-ground surveillance aircraft pledged by member states has yet materialized .
" these limitations and / or constraints are on deployment time and high risk ... in particular when conducting concurrent operations , " they said in the declaration .
the eu has less than six months to go before it is supposed to meet the " headline goal , " which envisages a 60,000-strong rapid reaction force that could be deployed within 60 days and remain on the ground for up to a year .
british defense minister geoff hoon said reaching such a goal was unlikely , pointing out that it took 70 days for britain to deploy 45,000 troops used in the war against iraq . " my message to colleagues today was that we still have a great deal more to do to meet the shortfalls in capacity , " hoon told reporters on monday .
" my message today was that they can ’ t put it in a box marked ‘ we ’ ve done that , ’ because they haven ’ t . "
even eu foreign policy chief javier solana made no bones about the enormity of the task facing the eu .
" it is hardly the time to rest on our laurels , " solana told ministers in brussels .
budget shortfalls in 2001 , the eu set up 19 expert panels to identify the biggest shortcomings that would have to be overcome in order to make the joint defense project a success and how to better pool the resources necessary to achieve that goal .
but the defense project has been badly hit with several countries lowering their defense budgets or letting them stagnate in the face of general belt-tightening .
" i don ’ t see signs that countries will increase budgets , " an eu military official told reuters on monday .
" so it ’ s a question of how willing they are , politically , to coordinate and get better output from what little they are prepared to spend . "
germany wants relaxed spending rules among the proposals on the board for rectifying the strained financial situation were efforts to forge a unified and lucrative eu defense industry .
but several countries also called for a loosening of the economic pact that ensures the stability of the euro , europe 's common currency .
germany , france and italy have called for relaxation of the eu ’ s strict public spending rules by excluding defense from overall expenditure and thus boosting europe ’ s military capabilities .
the three countries argued that military spending was being curtailed by the stability and growth pact , which underpins the euro by limiting public expenditure to below three percent of gross domestic product .
europe 's total annual defense spending amounts to just € 40 billion -lrb- $ 46.8 billion -rrb- contrasted with a u.s. military budget of $ 100 billion a year .
german defense minister peter struck , whose country is already in breach of the pact , said british criticism that eu defense ministers were failing to improve military capabilities or increase defense budget was completely justified .
struck said in brussels on monday that he was still aiming to increase defense spending in the near future .
germany 's current defense budget amounts to € 25 billion and accounts for 1.2 percent of german gdp according to struck .
military investments make up a quarter of the total defense budget .
the minister is likely to take up the matter with german finance minister eichel who remains determined to curtail the defense budget .
" that is a point , which has to be discussed further , " struck said in brussels .
berlin is also increasing its contribution to the eu rapid reaction force by 1,000 soldiers , thus increasing the german contingent to 33,000 troops .

warsaw has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for soldiers .
germany has said it will only send soldiers under a united nations mandate . poland has asked nato for help in filling out the 10,000-soldier security force it pledged to patrol parts of postwar iraq , germany 's defense minister confirmed to reporters during an eu defense ministers meeting monday . warsaw had said it was prepared to take over duties from british and american troops in one of three military sectors in iraq but lacked the troops for the job . the polish government has reportedly sent a letter to nato headquarters in brussels asking for help .
poland can only supply 2,000 of the 10,000 troops needed for the reconstruction mission . italy , spain , denmark , the netherlands , bulgaria and the ukraine have already agreed to supply troops for the stability force which could be sent to the gulf at short notice .
still unclear is exactly who will provide the force its mandate . nato chiefs have said in the past they agree in principal to discuss the issue .
the united nations has not yet begun discussing the possibility publicly . german involvement unclear germany has maintiained that it will need a u.n. mandate before sending troops to postwar iraq .
german defense minister peter struck bristled earlier this month when informed poland wanted to make use of nato brigade comprising danish , german and polish troops for their postwar iraq duties . " i find it remarkable that poland and other countries are ready to take responsibility in iraq .
these countries know that for germany , any engagement in iraq is tied to u.n. involvement .
this is unforeseen as yet and , as such , it 's not something we have to consider , " struck told reporters . after talks described as " candid " with u.s. defense secretary colin powell last friday , german foreign minister joschka fischer said he was still hopeful for u.n. involvement in postwar iraq .

dw-world takes a look at teen music sensation , t.a.t.u. it 's been a while since we had something to look forward to at eurovision .
most years song contest fans are faced with out of tune euro-pop hits and hapless presenters struggling with a script delivered simultaneously in french , english and their native language .
but not this year .
no , this year eurovision has t.a.t.u.
the russian lesbian teen pop sensation who will represent their home country at this saturday 's contest in the latvian capital , riga , are odds-on favorites to win and give moscow the chance to host next year 's contest .
the bookies have even got good odds on the pair – - who say they are lovers – kissing on stage .
the duo , consisting of 17 year-old lena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova , have been hot property since they shot to fame across europe at the start of the year .
the band - whose name is a shortened form of the russian , " ta dyevushka lubit tu " – " this girl loves that one " - is managed by a former child psychologist and filmmaker , ivan shapovalov , who created the act in 1998 .
school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .
rumors over the credibility and motives of the band ’ s manager , who supposedly came up with the idea of an underage lesbian band to attract scandal-seeking media attention , have also surfaced in recent weeks , dampening the girls ’ rebellious image .
cashing in on scandal but with odds of 9-2 , t.a.t.u is still a favorite to win eurovision this year .
unofficial fan sites for the pair are rallying viewers by posting instructions on how to vote for the pair .
and no matter what happens on saturday , eurovision organizers are preparing for all eventualities .
" we do n't know what they 'll do on stage – you never do with this group , " eurovision spokesperson sovita vevere told reuters .
" but we will have a taped performance from the dress rehearsal , so we can always switch to that if we need to . "
bad news for those who have put a bet on the two having a snog on stage .
" obviously the kiss has to be seen on tv , otherwise we ca n't pay out , " ladbrookes betting spokesman , warren lush told dw-world . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " let 's get happy " goes to eurovision germany 's representative at this year 's eurovision song contest , the annual celebration of all things musical , tacky and european , will be " let 's get happy " sung by lou hoffner -lrb- march 9 , 2003 -rrb- .

dw-world takes a look at teen music sensation , t.a.t.u. it 's been a while since we had something to look forward to at eurovision .
most years song contest fans are faced with out of tune euro-pop hits and hapless presenters struggling with a script delivered simultaneously in french , english and their native language .
but not this year .
no , this year eurovision has t.a.t.u.
the russian lesbian teen pop sensation who will represent their home country at this saturday 's contest in the latvian capital , riga , are odds-on favorites to win and give moscow the chance to host next year 's contest .
the bookies have even got good odds on the pair – - who say they are lovers – kissing on stage .
the duo , consisting of 17 year-old lena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova , have been hot property since they shot to fame across europe at the start of the year .
the band - whose name is a shortened form of the russian , " ta dyevushka lubit tu " – " this girl loves that one " - is managed by a former child psychologist and filmmaker , ivan shapovalov , who created the act in 1998 .
school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .
rumors over the credibility and motives of the band ’ s manager , who supposedly came up with the idea of an underage lesbian band to attract scandal-seeking media attention , have also surfaced in recent weeks , dampening the girls ’ rebellious image .
cashing in on scandal but with odds of 9-2 , t.a.t.u is still a favorite to win eurovision this year .
unofficial fan sites for the pair are rallying viewers by posting instructions on how to vote for the pair .
and no matter what happens on saturday , eurovision organizers are preparing for all eventualities .
" we do n't know what they 'll do on stage – you never do with this group , " eurovision spokesperson sovita vevere told reuters .
" but we will have a taped performance from the dress rehearsal , so we can always switch to that if we need to . "
bad news for those who have put a bet on the two having a snog on stage .

boycott of europe loses steam current affairs -pipe- 20.05.2003 reactions : how important is colin powell 's visit ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colin powell is likely to ask pointed questions on what germany can offer in postwar iraq transatlantic experts on both sides of the pond offer their take on what will be discussed during the powell-schröder meeting on friday and reflect on u.s.-german relations and the long road ahead . much less the " bridge-building " trip many had hoped for , most experts are seeing u.s. secretary of state colin powell 's visit to berlin as a small , but important step in what remains a long road ahead for the american-german political relationship .
powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .

the u.s. announced earlier this week it wants the security council to decide on a resolution authored by spain , great britain and the u.s. next week .
france and russia have said it is too soon and are wary of wording in the resolution that would dismantle the u.n. oil-for-food program and put iraqi oil into coalition hands .

but the substantive point , what schroder has repeated over the past weeks , is that transatlantic relations are vital for germany , much more important than for france .
the misperception that germany could pick and choose , either transatlantic relations or french relations , is nonsense .
germany has to have good relations with france and good relations with the united states . chancellor schröder will try to say , ' yes we are moving in the right direction , but we need clear sign from the united states that they are also moving . '

powell , who arrived thursday evening , will meet with chancellor gerhard schröder for talks on friday morning .
experts interviewed by dw-world said powell will most likely praise germany for its role in the war on terrorism and pivotal role in the u.n. peacekeeping mission in kabul , afghanistan .

dw-world takes a look at teen music sensation , t.a.t.u. it 's been a while since we had something to look forward to at eurovision .
most years song contest fans are faced with out of tune euro-pop hits and hapless presenters struggling with a script delivered simultaneously in french , english and their native language .
but not this year .
no , this year eurovision has t.a.t.u.
the russian lesbian teen pop sensation who will represent their home country at this saturday 's contest in the latvian capital , riga , are odds-on favorites to win and give moscow the chance to host next year 's contest .
the bookies have even got good odds on the pair – - who say they are lovers – kissing on stage .
the duo , consisting of 17 year-old lena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova , have been hot property since they shot to fame across europe at the start of the year .
the band - whose name is a shortened form of the russian , " ta dyevushka lubit tu " – " this girl loves that one " - is managed by a former child psychologist and filmmaker , ivan shapovalov , who created the act in 1998 .
school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .
rumors over the credibility and motives of the band ’ s manager , who supposedly came up with the idea of an underage lesbian band to attract scandal-seeking media attention , have also surfaced in recent weeks , dampening the girls ’ rebellious image .
cashing in on scandal but with odds of 9-2 , t.a.t.u is still a favorite to win eurovision this year .
unofficial fan sites for the pair are rallying viewers by posting instructions on how to vote for the pair .
and no matter what happens on saturday , eurovision organizers are preparing for all eventualities .
" we do n't know what they 'll do on stage – you never do with this group , " eurovision spokesperson sovita vevere told reuters .
" but we will have a taped performance from the dress rehearsal , so we can always switch to that if we need to . "
bad news for those who have put a bet on the two having a snog on stage .

dw-world takes a look at teen music sensation , t.a.t.u. it 's been a while since we had something to look forward to at eurovision .
most years song contest fans are faced with out of tune euro-pop hits and hapless presenters struggling with a script delivered simultaneously in french , english and their native language .
but not this year .
no , this year eurovision has t.a.t.u.
the russian lesbian teen pop sensation who will represent their home country at this saturday 's contest in the latvian capital , riga , are odds-on favorites to win and give moscow the chance to host next year 's contest .
the bookies have even got good odds on the pair – - who say they are lovers – kissing on stage .
the duo , consisting of 17 year-old lena katina and 18 year-old julia volkova , have been hot property since they shot to fame across europe at the start of the year .
the band - whose name is a shortened form of the russian , " ta dyevushka lubit tu " – " this girl loves that one " - is managed by a former child psychologist and filmmaker , ivan shapovalov , who created the act in 1998 .
school girl antics but t.a.t.u is less famous for its music than for being a gay phenomenon. t.a.t.u 's video for the debut single " all the things she said , " saw the pair dressed in skimpy school uniforms , kissing and indulging in passionate embraces while warbling about forbidden gay love .
britain was not amused and the pair was slammed by top daytime tv presenters , richard and judy as " paedo pop . "
but volkova and katina continued to flaunt their brand of shock and scandal .
after agreeing not to mention the war when they appeared on jay leno 's stateside tv talk show , the pair turned up with t-shirts with " fuck war " written in cyrillic .
the researcher who booked them reportedly ended up in tears when the ruse was discovered after the show .
flash in the pan even if the pair does win at eurovision , a sustainable future in pop music remains questionable .
and after last month ’ s canceled concert tour in britain , no one ’ s placing any bets that the duo is here to stay .
in fact , rumors have it that not even the prospect of seeing two girls kiss was enough to get britain ’ s males to fill wembley stadium .
a later pr stunt proved equally as ineffective when t.a.t.u advertised for schoolgirl fans to take part in their new video .
only 13 girls dressed in miniskirts and school ties turned up for the shoot on london 's south bank .
volkova and katina were nowhere to be seen and , it transpired later , did not have permission to film there in the first place .
rumors over the credibility and motives of the band ’ s manager , who supposedly came up with the idea of an underage lesbian band to attract scandal-seeking media attention , have also surfaced in recent weeks , dampening the girls ’ rebellious image .
cashing in on scandal but with odds of 9-2 , t.a.t.u is still a favorite to win eurovision this year .
unofficial fan sites for the pair are rallying viewers by posting instructions on how to vote for the pair .
and no matter what happens on saturday , eurovision organizers are preparing for all eventualities .
" we do n't know what they 'll do on stage – you never do with this group , " eurovision spokesperson sovita vevere told reuters .
" but we will have a taped performance from the dress rehearsal , so we can always switch to that if we need to . "
bad news for those who have put a bet on the two having a snog on stage .
" obviously the kiss has to be seen on tv , otherwise we ca n't pay out , " ladbrookes betting spokesman , warren lush told dw-world . ruth elkins send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " let 's get happy " goes to eurovision germany 's representative at this year 's eurovision song contest , the annual celebration of all things musical , tacky and european , will be " let 's get happy " sung by lou hoffner -lrb- march 9 , 2003 -rrb- .

west africa 's only english-speaking call centre has the hushed atmosphere of a scientific experiment rather than the expected hubbub of telephone salesmen at work .
but then this is an experiment .
in an upstairs room of an internet incubator firm in ghana 's capital accra , the pioneering call centre has just completed its first week of operation .
four sales staff are watched over proudly by one of the firm 's founders , karim morsli , who explains what is happening in an awed whisper .
the sales agent dials up over the internet , and tries to sell a mobile phone plan for german mobile operator t-mobile to a random selection of people in the us who have recently arrived home from work .
" as far as we know we 're the first people in ghana to do this , " mr morsli says .
he adds that it has taken more than a year to explain to the communications ministry what voice-over-internet technology is all about .
changing legal history it is the internet that has made the outsourcing of call centres possible , cutting out the cost and vagaries of international phone calls and enabling the cheap labour of developing countries to be exploited .
while it is legal for us citizens to call ghana over the internet , it is illegal for people or internet cafes to offer that same service in reverse . "
i guess i 've got a different perception of risk to many other people " karim morsli ghana , like many other african countries , is afraid of the revenue it will lose if the state telecoms firm gives up its monopoly on international phone calls .
we had to keep repeating that if the government forced us to work through ghana telecom then we were going to india instead , mr morsli explains .
the threat of losing business to india worked , and rising data was eventually granted its licence to use voice-over-internet technology via satellite .
a risky profile that long battle with bureaucracy and the high cost of connectivity via satellite makes the business somewhat of a risky venture for the pioneers .
foreign investors could n't be tempted to put up any money , and the start-up capital came primarily from friends and family .
" i guess i 've got a different perception of risk to many other people , " says mr morsli , who describes himself and his malian partner as " children of the world bank " .
they met at school in washington and their parents ' careers meant that they have travelled extensively .
" in africa i saw lots of talent and not enough opportunities to make use of it all , " he says .
window of opportunity it may be difficult for many westerners to get excited about the fact that africa is jumping on the bandwagon of the dreaded telemarketing that disturbs many a peaceful evening .
but from an african perspective , call centres could give the continent the chance to use some of its untapped potential and allow it to muscle its way into the global outsourcing business .
" there 's no reason why africa ca n't catch up with the rest of the world , " mr morsli says , saying that the big cats wo n't come to town until the smaller guys take the risks and test the territory .
but more cautious observers are sceptical as to whether africa will really attract large-scale businesses and fear that the window of opportunity has already been lost .
fearful firms " there 's been a cloud of confusion and uncertainty over call centres , " says gregg pascal zachary , a research fellow for ghana at the international computer science institute .
" the government needs to reassure the private sector that there are clear rules .
the last thing a big american firm wants to do is break the law in a developing country , " he says .
but , even at this early stage , mr morsli is confident that his model works and can be duplicated throughout africa .
he plans to grow his 20-strong employees into a workforce of 5,000 telemarketers within the next five years .
" if we fail it will be because of external factors , and that will give investors a very bad message about africa , " he says .
in the next article in this series , bbc news online examines how technology is enabling africa to participate in the global textiles industry .
" powering the global village " will appear on tuesday 27 may .

it is the largest fine ever imposed by the us financial watchdog , the securities & exchange commission -lrb- sec -rrb- .
the fine was originally set at $ 1.5bn , but that figure was reduced to $ 500m after the firm filed for bankruptcy .
despite the record value of the fine , one group of former worldcom employees , boycottmci.com , denounced the settlement as " a slap on the wrist " and " an insignificant amount by any standard " .
worldcom 's collapse wiped out nearly $ 180bn in shareholder wealth .
worldcom is accused of falsifying its balance sheets to the tune of $ 11bn in order to inflate profits .
under the settlement agreement , worldcom neither admits or denies the charges .
the settlement must still be approved by a district court judge , who said he would consider the deal and rule on 11 june .
illegal practice settling with the sec should help mci emerge from bankruptcy by the autumn , legal experts said .
over the worst ?
the latest on worldcom 's attempts to escape bankruptcy the sec charged worldcom in june with fraud .
it alleged the company manipulated its financial records to meet wall street expectations .
the basis of the fraud was the illegal practice of reporting various rental expenses as capital investment , allowing the firm to appear vastly more profitable than it ever was .
" this $ 500m is really just a drop in the bucket , " robert weiss , a lawyer who represents some of mci 's shareholders told bbc world service radio .
although a portion of the fine is likely to be allocated to shareholders , he said it remains far too difficult for investors to get their money back through the courts .
criminal charges since its bankruptcy filing in july , worldcom has hired a new chairman and overhauled its management team .
the company has also changed its name back to mci .
meanwhile , former chief financial officer scott sullivan has been charged with securities fraud , conspiracy , and making false statements about worldcom 's financial health in sec filings .
four other worldcom executives have pleaded guilty to securities fraud and agreed to co-operate with investigators .
two reports reviewing worldcom 's past accounting practices have been delayed at the request of prosecutors , who claim early public disclosure could harm criminal investigations into former worldcom chief executive bernie ebbers and other former executives .
