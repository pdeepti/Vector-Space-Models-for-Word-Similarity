program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2003 cnn à la francaise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spurred on by the iraq war , france wants to spread the news , too .
france plans to set up an international tv news channel by late 2004 .
it is meant to compete with cnn and bbc world but will broadcast in french . if news shapes ideas , shaping the news is all the more important .
that 's clearly the logic behind french plans unveiled this week to start an international french-language television channel by late 2004 . a parliamentary working group presented its recommendations for the channel on tuesday that foresees a 50-50 cooperation between france télévisions , the country 's public broadcaster , and europe 's largest private tv channel tf1 to set up and run the channel . " bolstered by the assets of france 's top public and private television companies , this channel will promote a french vision that is more necessary than ever in today 's world , " prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's office said in a statement this week . chirac 's pet but raffarin does n't get the credit for the idea .
indeed , a french-language international television channel is one of french president jacques chirac 's pet projects .
apparently unsatisfied with the international media landscape , last year the french president breathed new life into an idea that had been dallied with in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac jo groebel , director general of the european institute for the media , suggested the iraq war triggered chirac to press for the channel 's creation .
" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " groebel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " but even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .
then in an interim report in may parliamentarians pointed out that without such a channel the field was open for british and american reporting on the war . not the first france is already involved in the international french-language channel , tv5 , a cooperation with other francophone countries like belgium and switzerland which broadcasts in more than 165 countries .
but tv5 is not a news channel . the french seem to think there is an additional market for a news channel in french .
the plans revealed by french parliamentarian bernard brochand on tuesday specified that the channel would not even be broadcast in france . " i 'm not sure there 's the same audience for a french-language service as there is for anglo-saxon channels , " jo groebel said .
" undoubtedly there is enough interest for francophone news in french .
the question is who it would be aimed at who is not already reached by tv5 or radio france international . " in any case , though , such a channel would add to global news pluralism , groebel said .
" from the political point of view , it makes sense for the french ' slash ' europeans to have a broader view , " he said .
" there is definitely room for a fourth global player . "
but whether rivals france télévisions and tf1 will be able to cooperate will yet be seen .
" if there is political will , in a country where things are sometimes steered centrally , i would assume an openness to make this real , " groebel said .
" from a political point of view everyone would welcome it .

it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears . thirteen years have passed since german reunification ; 13 years in which east germans and west germans have had the chance to become acquainted with one another .
apart from the economic problems in the new german states , there 's a growing feeling of togetherness between the east and the west .
the two sides have already demonstrated that they have a common destiny .
during last year 's record flooding on the elbe river in eastern germany , aid came from all parts of germany , both east and west .
at the same time , west germans have shown little interest in learning more about the life of their fellow eastern german compatriots during the communist rule of the german democratic republic .
people can not claim , clichés aside , to have sufficient knowledge of those times .
but it is important that they do because the differences in the socialization of people that occured in both german states naturally has consequences that reach out far beyond oct .

reunified germany 's new role this generation is growing up in a germany that has created a new role for itself in global politics .
the old federal republic of germany 's sovereignty was always diminished because of the country 's division and its need to express reserve on the stage of world politics .
but now there is an obligation for a united germany to play a stronger role .
the country is engaged in military missions in the balkans and afghanistan .
with these missions , germany 's confidence in international politics is growing .
germany 's clear opposition to washington 's plans for war in iraq served as a poignant example of this growing confidence .
it showed a tenor that , at least in its openness , would n't have been imaginable earlier . that 's also a byproduct of reunification , a process that has increased the international community 's expectations of germany just as much as it has changed its domestic social structure .
the more these demands increase , so must germany 's reliability and consistency , especially when it comes to issues like berlin 's role in the european union or maintaining the german-french friendship .

it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears . thirteen years have passed since german reunification ; 13 years in which east germans and west germans have had the chance to become acquainted with one another .
apart from the economic problems in the new german states , there 's a growing feeling of togetherness between the east and the west .
the two sides have already demonstrated that they have a common destiny .
during last year 's record flooding on the elbe river in eastern germany , aid came from all parts of germany , both east and west .
at the same time , west germans have shown little interest in learning more about the life of their fellow eastern german compatriots during the communist rule of the german democratic republic .
people can not claim , clichés aside , to have sufficient knowledge of those times .
but it is important that they do because the differences in the socialization of people that occured in both german states naturally has consequences that reach out far beyond oct .
3 , 1990 .
against this backdrop , a number of tv stations are producing gdr nostalgia programs that focus on the every day life of residents of east germany .
and there is an obvious need to engage in the issues these shows raise .
unfortunately , too few west germans are viewing .
as things stand now , the borders between east and west germany , which exist in the heads of most germans , will only disappear when today 's children and youth reach adulthood .
reunified germany 's new role this generation is growing up in a germany that has created a new role for itself in global politics .
the old federal republic of germany 's sovereignty was always diminished because of the country 's division and its need to express reserve on the stage of world politics .
but now there is an obligation for a united germany to play a stronger role .
the country is engaged in military missions in the balkans and afghanistan .
with these missions , germany 's confidence in international politics is growing .
germany 's clear opposition to washington 's plans for war in iraq served as a poignant example of this growing confidence .
it showed a tenor that , at least in its openness , would n't have been imaginable earlier . that 's also a byproduct of reunification , a process that has increased the international community 's expectations of germany just as much as it has changed its domestic social structure .
the more these demands increase , so must germany 's reliability and consistency , especially when it comes to issues like berlin 's role in the european union or maintaining the german-french friendship .
the importance of these tasks have n't decreased .
they remain of equal importance as the integration of germany .
the one thing the relationships have in common is this : there is no fixed terminus - it 's a process that will be a lasting challenge . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the absence of any mention of god in the preamble of the european union 's new constitution is set to spark debate again as eu leaders gather to discuss the blueprint this weekend in italy . months after the issue had been swept aside , the question of whether god will have a place in the document that will chart the course of an expanded europe is set to flare-up once again this weekend . italy , ireland , spain and new eu member poland are likely to lead a push to get a mention of europe 's christian roots into the constitution , which was completed in june and is being discussed by eu leaders this weekend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2003 cnn à la francaise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spurred on by the iraq war , france wants to spread the news , too .
france plans to set up an international tv news channel by late 2004 .
it is meant to compete with cnn and bbc world but will broadcast in french . if news shapes ideas , shaping the news is all the more important .
that 's clearly the logic behind french plans unveiled this week to start an international french-language television channel by late 2004 . a parliamentary working group presented its recommendations for the channel on tuesday that foresees a 50-50 cooperation between france télévisions , the country 's public broadcaster , and europe 's largest private tv channel tf1 to set up and run the channel . " bolstered by the assets of france 's top public and private television companies , this channel will promote a french vision that is more necessary than ever in today 's world , " prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's office said in a statement this week . chirac 's pet but raffarin does n't get the credit for the idea .
indeed , a french-language international television channel is one of french president jacques chirac 's pet projects .
apparently unsatisfied with the international media landscape , last year the french president breathed new life into an idea that had been dallied with in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac jo groebel , director general of the european institute for the media , suggested the iraq war triggered chirac to press for the channel 's creation .
" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " groebel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " but even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .

3 , 1990 .
it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears . thirteen years have passed since german reunification ; 13 years in which east germans and west germans have had the chance to become acquainted with one another .
apart from the economic problems in the new german states , there 's a growing feeling of togetherness between the east and the west .
the two sides have already demonstrated that they have a common destiny .
during last year 's record flooding on the elbe river in eastern germany , aid came from all parts of germany , both east and west .
at the same time , west germans have shown little interest in learning more about the life of their fellow eastern german compatriots during the communist rule of the german democratic republic .
people can not claim , clichés aside , to have sufficient knowledge of those times .
but it is important that they do because the differences in the socialization of people that occured in both german states naturally has consequences that reach out far beyond oct .
3 , 1990 .
against this backdrop , a number of tv stations are producing gdr nostalgia programs that focus on the every day life of residents of east germany .
and there is an obvious need to engage in the issues these shows raise .
unfortunately , too few west germans are viewing .
as things stand now , the borders between east and west germany , which exist in the heads of most germans , will only disappear when today 's children and youth reach adulthood .
reunified germany 's new role this generation is growing up in a germany that has created a new role for itself in global politics .
the old federal republic of germany 's sovereignty was always diminished because of the country 's division and its need to express reserve on the stage of world politics .
but now there is an obligation for a united germany to play a stronger role .
the country is engaged in military missions in the balkans and afghanistan .
with these missions , germany 's confidence in international politics is growing .
germany 's clear opposition to washington 's plans for war in iraq served as a poignant example of this growing confidence .
it showed a tenor that , at least in its openness , would n't have been imaginable earlier . that 's also a byproduct of reunification , a process that has increased the international community 's expectations of germany just as much as it has changed its domestic social structure .
the more these demands increase , so must germany 's reliability and consistency , especially when it comes to issues like berlin 's role in the european union or maintaining the german-french friendship .
the importance of these tasks have n't decreased .
they remain of equal importance as the integration of germany .
the one thing the relationships have in common is this : there is no fixed terminus - it 's a process that will be a lasting challenge . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the absence of any mention of god in the preamble of the european union 's new constitution is set to spark debate again as eu leaders gather to discuss the blueprint this weekend in italy . months after the issue had been swept aside , the question of whether god will have a place in the document that will chart the course of an expanded europe is set to flare-up once again this weekend . italy , ireland , spain and new eu member poland are likely to lead a push to get a mention of europe 's christian roots into the constitution , which was completed in june and is being discussed by eu leaders this weekend .
the eu leaders , including the heads of 10 new member countries set to join in 2004 , will have to agree on the wording of the current constitution before ratifying it some time next year . the current constitution - a rough draft to some countries , a completed document to others - makes no mention of god in the preamble . the omission bothered the conservative members of the convention that drafted the constitution over the past year . along with governments like poland and spain , they began making calls for changes at the beginning of the year . but opponents , among them the french president of the convention valérie giscard d 'estaing , won out in the end . more backing for mention of god now , the countries that pushed for a mention of god are likely to get the backing of additional governments as they renew their request at the intergovernmental conference this weekend in rome .
malta , set to be the smallest eu country when it joins in may 2004 , threw its support behind the pro-god camp .
austria , portugal and the netherlands are rumoured to be joining the pope in demanding a mention of god . at stake is the importance of religion in a document that will chart the course of an expanded european union that might one day include muslim turkey . opponents , chief among them the governments of france and finland , say any mention of god would alienate the millions of europeans who believe in other religions or are atheists . " i do n't want to provoke a religious war , " luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker told a german newspaper this week .
" one can believe in god without it necessary to include him in the constitution . " proponents say europe 's christian roots are undeniable and dismiss any constitution that does n't refer to them as unrepresentative . germany has so far tread a careful line on the dispute .
while opposition politicians in the christian democratic union call for a mention , foreign minister joschka fischer has been relatively quiet , saying the debate is a positive one . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , aznar fail to agree on eu constitution spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : 14 years of german unification solbes blames reunification for german economic woes communism sunk by the hunk in trunks ? dispossession of eastern german land illegal , court rules has rebuilding east germany failed ? germany -pipe- 03.10.2003 opinion : a progress report on german unity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the flag of a reunified germany flies near the reichstag on oct .
3 , 1990 .
it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears . thirteen years have passed since german reunification ; 13 years in which east germans and west germans have had the chance to become acquainted with one another .
apart from the economic problems in the new german states , there 's a growing feeling of togetherness between the east and the west .
the two sides have already demonstrated that they have a common destiny .
during last year 's record flooding on the elbe river in eastern germany , aid came from all parts of germany , both east and west .
at the same time , west germans have shown little interest in learning more about the life of their fellow eastern german compatriots during the communist rule of the german democratic republic .
people can not claim , clichés aside , to have sufficient knowledge of those times .
but it is important that they do because the differences in the socialization of people that occured in both german states naturally has consequences that reach out far beyond oct .
3 , 1990 .
against this backdrop , a number of tv stations are producing gdr nostalgia programs that focus on the every day life of residents of east germany .
and there is an obvious need to engage in the issues these shows raise .
unfortunately , too few west germans are viewing .
as things stand now , the borders between east and west germany , which exist in the heads of most germans , will only disappear when today 's children and youth reach adulthood .
reunified germany 's new role this generation is growing up in a germany that has created a new role for itself in global politics .
the old federal republic of germany 's sovereignty was always diminished because of the country 's division and its need to express reserve on the stage of world politics .
but now there is an obligation for a united germany to play a stronger role .
the country is engaged in military missions in the balkans and afghanistan .
with these missions , germany 's confidence in international politics is growing .
germany 's clear opposition to washington 's plans for war in iraq served as a poignant example of this growing confidence .
it showed a tenor that , at least in its openness , would n't have been imaginable earlier . that 's also a byproduct of reunification , a process that has increased the international community 's expectations of germany just as much as it has changed its domestic social structure .
the more these demands increase , so must germany 's reliability and consistency , especially when it comes to issues like berlin 's role in the european union or maintaining the german-french friendship .
the importance of these tasks have n't decreased .
they remain of equal importance as the integration of germany .
the one thing the relationships have in common is this : there is no fixed terminus - it 's a process that will be a lasting challenge . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2003 cnn à la francaise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spurred on by the iraq war , france wants to spread the news , too .
france plans to set up an international tv news channel by late 2004 .
it is meant to compete with cnn and bbc world but will broadcast in french . if news shapes ideas , shaping the news is all the more important .
that 's clearly the logic behind french plans unveiled this week to start an international french-language television channel by late 2004 . a parliamentary working group presented its recommendations for the channel on tuesday that foresees a 50-50 cooperation between france télévisions , the country 's public broadcaster , and europe 's largest private tv channel tf1 to set up and run the channel . " bolstered by the assets of france 's top public and private television companies , this channel will promote a french vision that is more necessary than ever in today 's world , " prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's office said in a statement this week . chirac 's pet but raffarin does n't get the credit for the idea .
indeed , a french-language international television channel is one of french president jacques chirac 's pet projects .
apparently unsatisfied with the international media landscape , last year the french president breathed new life into an idea that had been dallied with in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac jo groebel , director general of the european institute for the media , suggested the iraq war triggered chirac to press for the channel 's creation .
" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " groebel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " but even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .

3 , 1990 .
it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears . thirteen years have passed since german reunification ; 13 years in which east germans and west germans have had the chance to become acquainted with one another .
apart from the economic problems in the new german states , there 's a growing feeling of togetherness between the east and the west .
the two sides have already demonstrated that they have a common destiny .
during last year 's record flooding on the elbe river in eastern germany , aid came from all parts of germany , both east and west .
at the same time , west germans have shown little interest in learning more about the life of their fellow eastern german compatriots during the communist rule of the german democratic republic .
people can not claim , clichés aside , to have sufficient knowledge of those times .
but it is important that they do because the differences in the socialization of people that occured in both german states naturally has consequences that reach out far beyond oct .
3 , 1990 .
against this backdrop , a number of tv stations are producing gdr nostalgia programs that focus on the every day life of residents of east germany .
and there is an obvious need to engage in the issues these shows raise .
unfortunately , too few west germans are viewing .
as things stand now , the borders between east and west germany , which exist in the heads of most germans , will only disappear when today 's children and youth reach adulthood .
reunified germany 's new role this generation is growing up in a germany that has created a new role for itself in global politics .
the old federal republic of germany 's sovereignty was always diminished because of the country 's division and its need to express reserve on the stage of world politics .
but now there is an obligation for a united germany to play a stronger role .
the country is engaged in military missions in the balkans and afghanistan .
with these missions , germany 's confidence in international politics is growing .
germany 's clear opposition to washington 's plans for war in iraq served as a poignant example of this growing confidence .
it showed a tenor that , at least in its openness , would n't have been imaginable earlier . that 's also a byproduct of reunification , a process that has increased the international community 's expectations of germany just as much as it has changed its domestic social structure .
the more these demands increase , so must germany 's reliability and consistency , especially when it comes to issues like berlin 's role in the european union or maintaining the german-french friendship .
the importance of these tasks have n't decreased .
they remain of equal importance as the integration of germany .
the one thing the relationships have in common is this : there is no fixed terminus - it 's a process that will be a lasting challenge . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears . thirteen years have passed since german reunification ; 13 years in which east germans and west germans have had the chance to become acquainted with one another .
apart from the economic problems in the new german states , there 's a growing feeling of togetherness between the east and the west .
the two sides have already demonstrated that they have a common destiny .
during last year 's record flooding on the elbe river in eastern germany , aid came from all parts of germany , both east and west .
at the same time , west germans have shown little interest in learning more about the life of their fellow eastern german compatriots during the communist rule of the german democratic republic .
people can not claim , clichés aside , to have sufficient knowledge of those times .
but it is important that they do because the differences in the socialization of people that occured in both german states naturally has consequences that reach out far beyond oct .

the country is engaged in military missions in the balkans and afghanistan .

germany 's clear opposition to washington 's plans for war in iraq served as a poignant example of this growing confidence .

the absence of any mention of god in the preamble of the european union 's new constitution is set to spark debate again as eu leaders gather to discuss the blueprint this weekend in italy . months after the issue had been swept aside , the question of whether god will have a place in the document that will chart the course of an expanded europe is set to flare-up once again this weekend . italy , ireland , spain and new eu member poland are likely to lead a push to get a mention of europe 's christian roots into the constitution , which was completed in june and is being discussed by eu leaders this weekend .
the eu leaders , including the heads of 10 new member countries set to join in 2004 , will have to agree on the wording of the current constitution before ratifying it some time next year . the current constitution - a rough draft to some countries , a completed document to others - makes no mention of god in the preamble . the omission bothered the conservative members of the convention that drafted the constitution over the past year . along with governments like poland and spain , they began making calls for changes at the beginning of the year . but opponents , among them the french president of the convention valérie giscard d 'estaing , won out in the end . more backing for mention of god now , the countries that pushed for a mention of god are likely to get the backing of additional governments as they renew their request at the intergovernmental conference this weekend in rome .
malta , set to be the smallest eu country when it joins in may 2004 , threw its support behind the pro-god camp .
austria , portugal and the netherlands are rumoured to be joining the pope in demanding a mention of god . at stake is the importance of religion in a document that will chart the course of an expanded european union that might one day include muslim turkey . opponents , chief among them the governments of france and finland , say any mention of god would alienate the millions of europeans who believe in other religions or are atheists . " i do n't want to provoke a religious war , " luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker told a german newspaper this week .
" one can believe in god without it necessary to include him in the constitution . " proponents say europe 's christian roots are undeniable and dismiss any constitution that does n't refer to them as unrepresentative . germany has so far tread a careful line on the dispute .
while opposition politicians in the christian democratic union call for a mention , foreign minister joschka fischer has been relatively quiet , saying the debate is a positive one . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , aznar fail to agree on eu constitution spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .

3 , 1990 .
it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears . thirteen years have passed since german reunification ; 13 years in which east germans and west germans have had the chance to become acquainted with one another .
apart from the economic problems in the new german states , there 's a growing feeling of togetherness between the east and the west .
the two sides have already demonstrated that they have a common destiny .
during last year 's record flooding on the elbe river in eastern germany , aid came from all parts of germany , both east and west .
at the same time , west germans have shown little interest in learning more about the life of their fellow eastern german compatriots during the communist rule of the german democratic republic .
people can not claim , clichés aside , to have sufficient knowledge of those times .
but it is important that they do because the differences in the socialization of people that occured in both german states naturally has consequences that reach out far beyond oct .
3 , 1990 .
against this backdrop , a number of tv stations are producing gdr nostalgia programs that focus on the every day life of residents of east germany .
and there is an obvious need to engage in the issues these shows raise .
unfortunately , too few west germans are viewing .
as things stand now , the borders between east and west germany , which exist in the heads of most germans , will only disappear when today 's children and youth reach adulthood .
reunified germany 's new role this generation is growing up in a germany that has created a new role for itself in global politics .
the old federal republic of germany 's sovereignty was always diminished because of the country 's division and its need to express reserve on the stage of world politics .
but now there is an obligation for a united germany to play a stronger role .
the country is engaged in military missions in the balkans and afghanistan .
with these missions , germany 's confidence in international politics is growing .
germany 's clear opposition to washington 's plans for war in iraq served as a poignant example of this growing confidence .
it showed a tenor that , at least in its openness , would n't have been imaginable earlier . that 's also a byproduct of reunification , a process that has increased the international community 's expectations of germany just as much as it has changed its domestic social structure .
the more these demands increase , so must germany 's reliability and consistency , especially when it comes to issues like berlin 's role in the european union or maintaining the german-french friendship .
the importance of these tasks have n't decreased .
they remain of equal importance as the integration of germany .

the absence of any mention of god in the preamble of the european union 's new constitution is set to spark debate again as eu leaders gather to discuss the blueprint this weekend in italy . months after the issue had been swept aside , the question of whether god will have a place in the document that will chart the course of an expanded europe is set to flare-up once again this weekend . italy , ireland , spain and new eu member poland are likely to lead a push to get a mention of europe 's christian roots into the constitution , which was completed in june and is being discussed by eu leaders this weekend .

it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears . thirteen years have passed since german reunification ; 13 years in which east germans and west germans have had the chance to become acquainted with one another .
apart from the economic problems in the new german states , there 's a growing feeling of togetherness between the east and the west .
the two sides have already demonstrated that they have a common destiny .
during last year 's record flooding on the elbe river in eastern germany , aid came from all parts of germany , both east and west .
at the same time , west germans have shown little interest in learning more about the life of their fellow eastern german compatriots during the communist rule of the german democratic republic .

the country is engaged in military missions in the balkans and afghanistan .
with these missions , germany 's confidence in international politics is growing .
germany 's clear opposition to washington 's plans for war in iraq served as a poignant example of this growing confidence .
it showed a tenor that , at least in its openness , would n't have been imaginable earlier . that 's also a byproduct of reunification , a process that has increased the international community 's expectations of germany just as much as it has changed its domestic social structure .

the old federal republic of germany 's sovereignty was always diminished because of the country 's division and its need to express reserve on the stage of world politics .
but now there is an obligation for a united germany to play a stronger role .
the country is engaged in military missions in the balkans and afghanistan .
with these missions , germany 's confidence in international politics is growing .
germany 's clear opposition to washington 's plans for war in iraq served as a poignant example of this growing confidence .
it showed a tenor that , at least in its openness , would n't have been imaginable earlier . that 's also a byproduct of reunification , a process that has increased the international community 's expectations of germany just as much as it has changed its domestic social structure .
the more these demands increase , so must germany 's reliability and consistency , especially when it comes to issues like berlin 's role in the european union or maintaining the german-french friendship .
the importance of these tasks have n't decreased .
they remain of equal importance as the integration of germany .
the one thing the relationships have in common is this : there is no fixed terminus - it 's a process that will be a lasting challenge . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

france plans to set up an international tv news channel by late 2004 .
it is meant to compete with cnn and bbc world but will broadcast in french . if news shapes ideas , shaping the news is all the more important .
that 's clearly the logic behind french plans unveiled this week to start an international french-language television channel by late 2004 . a parliamentary working group presented its recommendations for the channel on tuesday that foresees a 50-50 cooperation between france télévisions , the country 's public broadcaster , and europe 's largest private tv channel tf1 to set up and run the channel . " bolstered by the assets of france 's top public and private television companies , this channel will promote a french vision that is more necessary than ever in today 's world , " prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's office said in a statement this week . chirac 's pet but raffarin does n't get the credit for the idea .
indeed , a french-language international television channel is one of french president jacques chirac 's pet projects .
apparently unsatisfied with the international media landscape , last year the french president breathed new life into an idea that had been dallied with in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac jo groebel , director general of the european institute for the media , suggested the iraq war triggered chirac to press for the channel 's creation .
" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " groebel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " but even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .
then in an interim report in may parliamentarians pointed out that without such a channel the field was open for british and american reporting on the war . not the first france is already involved in the international french-language channel , tv5 , a cooperation with other francophone countries like belgium and switzerland which broadcasts in more than 165 countries .
but tv5 is not a news channel . the french seem to think there is an additional market for a news channel in french .
the plans revealed by french parliamentarian bernard brochand on tuesday specified that the channel would not even be broadcast in france . " i 'm not sure there 's the same audience for a french-language service as there is for anglo-saxon channels , " jo groebel said .
" undoubtedly there is enough interest for francophone news in french .
the question is who it would be aimed at who is not already reached by tv5 or radio france international . " in any case , though , such a channel would add to global news pluralism , groebel said .
" from the political point of view , it makes sense for the french ' slash ' europeans to have a broader view , " he said .
" there is definitely room for a fourth global player . "
but whether rivals france télévisions and tf1 will be able to cooperate will yet be seen .
" if there is political will , in a country where things are sometimes steered centrally , i would assume an openness to make this real , " groebel said .
" from a political point of view everyone would welcome it .

the absence of any mention of god in the preamble of the european union 's new constitution is set to spark debate again as eu leaders gather to discuss the blueprint this weekend in italy . months after the issue had been swept aside , the question of whether god will have a place in the document that will chart the course of an expanded europe is set to flare-up once again this weekend . italy , ireland , spain and new eu member poland are likely to lead a push to get a mention of europe 's christian roots into the constitution , which was completed in june and is being discussed by eu leaders this weekend .
the eu leaders , including the heads of 10 new member countries set to join in 2004 , will have to agree on the wording of the current constitution before ratifying it some time next year . the current constitution - a rough draft to some countries , a completed document to others - makes no mention of god in the preamble . the omission bothered the conservative members of the convention that drafted the constitution over the past year . along with governments like poland and spain , they began making calls for changes at the beginning of the year . but opponents , among them the french president of the convention valérie giscard d 'estaing , won out in the end . more backing for mention of god now , the countries that pushed for a mention of god are likely to get the backing of additional governments as they renew their request at the intergovernmental conference this weekend in rome .
malta , set to be the smallest eu country when it joins in may 2004 , threw its support behind the pro-god camp .
austria , portugal and the netherlands are rumoured to be joining the pope in demanding a mention of god . at stake is the importance of religion in a document that will chart the course of an expanded european union that might one day include muslim turkey . opponents , chief among them the governments of france and finland , say any mention of god would alienate the millions of europeans who believe in other religions or are atheists . " i do n't want to provoke a religious war , " luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker told a german newspaper this week .
" one can believe in god without it necessary to include him in the constitution . " proponents say europe 's christian roots are undeniable and dismiss any constitution that does n't refer to them as unrepresentative . germany has so far tread a careful line on the dispute .

it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears . thirteen years have passed since german reunification ; 13 years in which east germans and west germans have had the chance to become acquainted with one another .
apart from the economic problems in the new german states , there 's a growing feeling of togetherness between the east and the west .
the two sides have already demonstrated that they have a common destiny .
during last year 's record flooding on the elbe river in eastern germany , aid came from all parts of germany , both east and west .
at the same time , west germans have shown little interest in learning more about the life of their fellow eastern german compatriots during the communist rule of the german democratic republic .
people can not claim , clichés aside , to have sufficient knowledge of those times .
but it is important that they do because the differences in the socialization of people that occured in both german states naturally has consequences that reach out far beyond oct .
3 , 1990 .
against this backdrop , a number of tv stations are producing gdr nostalgia programs that focus on the every day life of residents of east germany .
and there is an obvious need to engage in the issues these shows raise .
unfortunately , too few west germans are viewing .
as things stand now , the borders between east and west germany , which exist in the heads of most germans , will only disappear when today 's children and youth reach adulthood .
reunified germany 's new role this generation is growing up in a germany that has created a new role for itself in global politics .
the old federal republic of germany 's sovereignty was always diminished because of the country 's division and its need to express reserve on the stage of world politics .
but now there is an obligation for a united germany to play a stronger role .
the country is engaged in military missions in the balkans and afghanistan .
with these missions , germany 's confidence in international politics is growing .
germany 's clear opposition to washington 's plans for war in iraq served as a poignant example of this growing confidence .
it showed a tenor that , at least in its openness , would n't have been imaginable earlier . that 's also a byproduct of reunification , a process that has increased the international community 's expectations of germany just as much as it has changed its domestic social structure .
the more these demands increase , so must germany 's reliability and consistency , especially when it comes to issues like berlin 's role in the european union or maintaining the german-french friendship .
the importance of these tasks have n't decreased .
they remain of equal importance as the integration of germany .
the one thing the relationships have in common is this : there is no fixed terminus - it 's a process that will be a lasting challenge . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the absence of any mention of god in the preamble of the european union 's new constitution is set to spark debate again as eu leaders gather to discuss the blueprint this weekend in italy . months after the issue had been swept aside , the question of whether god will have a place in the document that will chart the course of an expanded europe is set to flare-up once again this weekend . italy , ireland , spain and new eu member poland are likely to lead a push to get a mention of europe 's christian roots into the constitution , which was completed in june and is being discussed by eu leaders this weekend .
the eu leaders , including the heads of 10 new member countries set to join in 2004 , will have to agree on the wording of the current constitution before ratifying it some time next year . the current constitution - a rough draft to some countries , a completed document to others - makes no mention of god in the preamble . the omission bothered the conservative members of the convention that drafted the constitution over the past year . along with governments like poland and spain , they began making calls for changes at the beginning of the year . but opponents , among them the french president of the convention valérie giscard d 'estaing , won out in the end . more backing for mention of god now , the countries that pushed for a mention of god are likely to get the backing of additional governments as they renew their request at the intergovernmental conference this weekend in rome .
malta , set to be the smallest eu country when it joins in may 2004 , threw its support behind the pro-god camp .
austria , portugal and the netherlands are rumoured to be joining the pope in demanding a mention of god . at stake is the importance of religion in a document that will chart the course of an expanded european union that might one day include muslim turkey . opponents , chief among them the governments of france and finland , say any mention of god would alienate the millions of europeans who believe in other religions or are atheists . " i do n't want to provoke a religious war , " luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker told a german newspaper this week .
" one can believe in god without it necessary to include him in the constitution . " proponents say europe 's christian roots are undeniable and dismiss any constitution that does n't refer to them as unrepresentative . germany has so far tread a careful line on the dispute .
while opposition politicians in the christian democratic union call for a mention , foreign minister joschka fischer has been relatively quiet , saying the debate is a positive one . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , aznar fail to agree on eu constitution spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .

3 , 1990 .
it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears . thirteen years have passed since german reunification ; 13 years in which east germans and west germans have had the chance to become acquainted with one another .
apart from the economic problems in the new german states , there 's a growing feeling of togetherness between the east and the west .
the two sides have already demonstrated that they have a common destiny .
during last year 's record flooding on the elbe river in eastern germany , aid came from all parts of germany , both east and west .
at the same time , west germans have shown little interest in learning more about the life of their fellow eastern german compatriots during the communist rule of the german democratic republic .
people can not claim , clichés aside , to have sufficient knowledge of those times .
but it is important that they do because the differences in the socialization of people that occured in both german states naturally has consequences that reach out far beyond oct .
3 , 1990 .
against this backdrop , a number of tv stations are producing gdr nostalgia programs that focus on the every day life of residents of east germany .
and there is an obvious need to engage in the issues these shows raise .
unfortunately , too few west germans are viewing .
as things stand now , the borders between east and west germany , which exist in the heads of most germans , will only disappear when today 's children and youth reach adulthood .
reunified germany 's new role this generation is growing up in a germany that has created a new role for itself in global politics .
the old federal republic of germany 's sovereignty was always diminished because of the country 's division and its need to express reserve on the stage of world politics .
but now there is an obligation for a united germany to play a stronger role .
the country is engaged in military missions in the balkans and afghanistan .
with these missions , germany 's confidence in international politics is growing .
germany 's clear opposition to washington 's plans for war in iraq served as a poignant example of this growing confidence .
it showed a tenor that , at least in its openness , would n't have been imaginable earlier . that 's also a byproduct of reunification , a process that has increased the international community 's expectations of germany just as much as it has changed its domestic social structure .
the more these demands increase , so must germany 's reliability and consistency , especially when it comes to issues like berlin 's role in the european union or maintaining the german-french friendship .
the importance of these tasks have n't decreased .
they remain of equal importance as the integration of germany .

the absence of any mention of god in the preamble of the european union 's new constitution is set to spark debate again as eu leaders gather to discuss the blueprint this weekend in italy . months after the issue had been swept aside , the question of whether god will have a place in the document that will chart the course of an expanded europe is set to flare-up once again this weekend . italy , ireland , spain and new eu member poland are likely to lead a push to get a mention of europe 's christian roots into the constitution , which was completed in june and is being discussed by eu leaders this weekend .
the eu leaders , including the heads of 10 new member countries set to join in 2004 , will have to agree on the wording of the current constitution before ratifying it some time next year . the current constitution - a rough draft to some countries , a completed document to others - makes no mention of god in the preamble . the omission bothered the conservative members of the convention that drafted the constitution over the past year . along with governments like poland and spain , they began making calls for changes at the beginning of the year . but opponents , among them the french president of the convention valérie giscard d 'estaing , won out in the end . more backing for mention of god now , the countries that pushed for a mention of god are likely to get the backing of additional governments as they renew their request at the intergovernmental conference this weekend in rome .

austria , portugal and the netherlands are rumoured to be joining the pope in demanding a mention of god . at stake is the importance of religion in a document that will chart the course of an expanded european union that might one day include muslim turkey . opponents , chief among them the governments of france and finland , say any mention of god would alienate the millions of europeans who believe in other religions or are atheists .

france plans to set up an international tv news channel by late 2004 .
it is meant to compete with cnn and bbc world but will broadcast in french . if news shapes ideas , shaping the news is all the more important .
that 's clearly the logic behind french plans unveiled this week to start an international french-language television channel by late 2004 . a parliamentary working group presented its recommendations for the channel on tuesday that foresees a 50-50 cooperation between france télévisions , the country 's public broadcaster , and europe 's largest private tv channel tf1 to set up and run the channel .

" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " groebel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " but even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .
then in an interim report in may parliamentarians pointed out that without such a channel the field was open for british and american reporting on the war . not the first france is already involved in the international french-language channel , tv5 , a cooperation with other francophone countries like belgium and switzerland which broadcasts in more than 165 countries .
but tv5 is not a news channel . the french seem to think there is an additional market for a news channel in french .
the plans revealed by french parliamentarian bernard brochand on tuesday specified that the channel would not even be broadcast in france . " i 'm not sure there 's the same audience for a french-language service as there is for anglo-saxon channels , " jo groebel said .
" undoubtedly there is enough interest for francophone news in french .
the question is who it would be aimed at who is not already reached by tv5 or radio france international . " in any case , though , such a channel would add to global news pluralism , groebel said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2003 cnn à la francaise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spurred on by the iraq war , france wants to spread the news , too .
france plans to set up an international tv news channel by late 2004 .
it is meant to compete with cnn and bbc world but will broadcast in french . if news shapes ideas , shaping the news is all the more important .
that 's clearly the logic behind french plans unveiled this week to start an international french-language television channel by late 2004 . a parliamentary working group presented its recommendations for the channel on tuesday that foresees a 50-50 cooperation between france télévisions , the country 's public broadcaster , and europe 's largest private tv channel tf1 to set up and run the channel . " bolstered by the assets of france 's top public and private television companies , this channel will promote a french vision that is more necessary than ever in today 's world , " prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's office said in a statement this week . chirac 's pet but raffarin does n't get the credit for the idea .
indeed , a french-language international television channel is one of french president jacques chirac 's pet projects .
apparently unsatisfied with the international media landscape , last year the french president breathed new life into an idea that had been dallied with in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac jo groebel , director general of the european institute for the media , suggested the iraq war triggered chirac to press for the channel 's creation .
" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " groebel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " but even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .
then in an interim report in may parliamentarians pointed out that without such a channel the field was open for british and american reporting on the war . not the first france is already involved in the international french-language channel , tv5 , a cooperation with other francophone countries like belgium and switzerland which broadcasts in more than 165 countries .
but tv5 is not a news channel . the french seem to think there is an additional market for a news channel in french .
the plans revealed by french parliamentarian bernard brochand on tuesday specified that the channel would not even be broadcast in france . " i 'm not sure there 's the same audience for a french-language service as there is for anglo-saxon channels , " jo groebel said .
" undoubtedly there is enough interest for francophone news in french .
the question is who it would be aimed at who is not already reached by tv5 or radio france international . " in any case , though , such a channel would add to global news pluralism , groebel said .
" from the political point of view , it makes sense for the french ' slash ' europeans to have a broader view , " he said .
" there is definitely room for a fourth global player . "
but whether rivals france télévisions and tf1 will be able to cooperate will yet be seen .
" if there is political will , in a country where things are sometimes steered centrally , i would assume an openness to make this real , " groebel said .
" from a political point of view everyone would welcome it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.10.2003 cnn à la francaise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spurred on by the iraq war , france wants to spread the news , too .
france plans to set up an international tv news channel by late 2004 .
it is meant to compete with cnn and bbc world but will broadcast in french . if news shapes ideas , shaping the news is all the more important .
that 's clearly the logic behind french plans unveiled this week to start an international french-language television channel by late 2004 . a parliamentary working group presented its recommendations for the channel on tuesday that foresees a 50-50 cooperation between france télévisions , the country 's public broadcaster , and europe 's largest private tv channel tf1 to set up and run the channel . " bolstered by the assets of france 's top public and private television companies , this channel will promote a french vision that is more necessary than ever in today 's world , " prime minister jean-pierre raffarin 's office said in a statement this week . chirac 's pet but raffarin does n't get the credit for the idea .
indeed , a french-language international television channel is one of french president jacques chirac 's pet projects .
apparently unsatisfied with the international media landscape , last year the french president breathed new life into an idea that had been dallied with in the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president jacques chirac jo groebel , director general of the european institute for the media , suggested the iraq war triggered chirac to press for the channel 's creation .
" during the war we had cnn , bbc world and al jazeera , " groebel said .
" and chirac perceived that public opinion would not necessarily be influenced , but be confronted by news coming from the anglo-saxon and arab channels . " but even before the iraq war began , the french foreign ministry had started looking into the feasibility of an international news channel .
then in an interim report in may parliamentarians pointed out that without such a channel the field was open for british and american reporting on the war . not the first france is already involved in the international french-language channel , tv5 , a cooperation with other francophone countries like belgium and switzerland which broadcasts in more than 165 countries .
but tv5 is not a news channel . the french seem to think there is an additional market for a news channel in french .
the plans revealed by french parliamentarian bernard brochand on tuesday specified that the channel would not even be broadcast in france . " i 'm not sure there 's the same audience for a french-language service as there is for anglo-saxon channels , " jo groebel said .
" undoubtedly there is enough interest for francophone news in french .
the question is who it would be aimed at who is not already reached by tv5 or radio france international . " in any case , though , such a channel would add to global news pluralism , groebel said .
" from the political point of view , it makes sense for the french ' slash ' europeans to have a broader view , " he said .
" there is definitely room for a fourth global player . "
but whether rivals france télévisions and tf1 will be able to cooperate will yet be seen .
" if there is political will , in a country where things are sometimes steered centrally , i would assume an openness to make this real , " groebel said .
" from a political point of view everyone would welcome it .

3 , 1990 .
it 's been over 13 years since the fall of the berlin wall , but germans still have a lot to learn about each other before the mental east-west border disappears . thirteen years have passed since german reunification ; 13 years in which east germans and west germans have had the chance to become acquainted with one another .
apart from the economic problems in the new german states , there 's a growing feeling of togetherness between the east and the west .
the two sides have already demonstrated that they have a common destiny .
during last year 's record flooding on the elbe river in eastern germany , aid came from all parts of germany , both east and west .
at the same time , west germans have shown little interest in learning more about the life of their fellow eastern german compatriots during the communist rule of the german democratic republic .
people can not claim , clichés aside , to have sufficient knowledge of those times .
but it is important that they do because the differences in the socialization of people that occured in both german states naturally has consequences that reach out far beyond oct .
3 , 1990 .
against this backdrop , a number of tv stations are producing gdr nostalgia programs that focus on the every day life of residents of east germany .
and there is an obvious need to engage in the issues these shows raise .
unfortunately , too few west germans are viewing .
as things stand now , the borders between east and west germany , which exist in the heads of most germans , will only disappear when today 's children and youth reach adulthood .
reunified germany 's new role this generation is growing up in a germany that has created a new role for itself in global politics .
the old federal republic of germany 's sovereignty was always diminished because of the country 's division and its need to express reserve on the stage of world politics .
but now there is an obligation for a united germany to play a stronger role .
the country is engaged in military missions in the balkans and afghanistan .
with these missions , germany 's confidence in international politics is growing .
germany 's clear opposition to washington 's plans for war in iraq served as a poignant example of this growing confidence .
it showed a tenor that , at least in its openness , would n't have been imaginable earlier . that 's also a byproduct of reunification , a process that has increased the international community 's expectations of germany just as much as it has changed its domestic social structure .
the more these demands increase , so must germany 's reliability and consistency , especially when it comes to issues like berlin 's role in the european union or maintaining the german-french friendship .
the importance of these tasks have n't decreased .
they remain of equal importance as the integration of germany .
the one thing the relationships have in common is this : there is no fixed terminus - it 's a process that will be a lasting challenge . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the eu leaders , including the heads of 10 new member countries set to join in 2004 , will have to agree on the wording of the current constitution before ratifying it some time next year . the current constitution - a rough draft to some countries , a completed document to others - makes no mention of god in the preamble . the omission bothered the conservative members of the convention that drafted the constitution over the past year . along with governments like poland and spain , they began making calls for changes at the beginning of the year . but opponents , among them the french president of the convention valérie giscard d 'estaing , won out in the end . more backing for mention of god now , the countries that pushed for a mention of god are likely to get the backing of additional governments as they renew their request at the intergovernmental conference this weekend in rome .
malta , set to be the smallest eu country when it joins in may 2004 , threw its support behind the pro-god camp .
austria , portugal and the netherlands are rumoured to be joining the pope in demanding a mention of god . at stake is the importance of religion in a document that will chart the course of an expanded european union that might one day include muslim turkey . opponents , chief among them the governments of france and finland , say any mention of god would alienate the millions of europeans who believe in other religions or are atheists . " i do n't want to provoke a religious war , " luxembourg 's prime minister jean-claude juncker told a german newspaper this week .
" one can believe in god without it necessary to include him in the constitution . " proponents say europe 's christian roots are undeniable and dismiss any constitution that does n't refer to them as unrepresentative . germany has so far tread a careful line on the dispute .
while opposition politicians in the christian democratic union call for a mention , foreign minister joschka fischer has been relatively quiet , saying the debate is a positive one . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder , aznar fail to agree on eu constitution spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .

if regulators back the move , anglian water , united utilities and northumbrian water customers will see an increase in their bills from april , ofwat said .
the regulator , ofwat , said it was weighing up whether to allow the trio to raise their prices because of changes to their financial position .
it added the three firms had told it they had seen major changes to income and costs that were not included in assumptions made during the last price review .
cost equation a final decision will be made in december .
ofwat director general philip fletcher said : " we shall be looking carefully to see whether the financial changes are big enough for us to reset the companies ' price limits . "
according to ofwat , anglian and united blamed construction expenses , rising customer debt , changes to water quality monitoring requirements , and flooding from sewers for pushing up their costs .

they joined the film 's co-stars julie dreyfus , darryl hannah and michael madsen for the british opening of tarantino 's controversial martial arts movie .
the director defended the film against accusations of graphic violence , saying it was so outlandish and bloody that it was obviously set in " fantasy land " .
" this is definitely not taking place on planet earth , " he said .
tarantino 's first movie since 1997 's jackie brown has already been hailed as a masterpiece by us critics .
the film , inspired in part by martial arts films of the 1970s , stars thurman as the bride , an elite assassin who is shot on her wedding day and left for dead by her boss bill , played by veteran actor david carradine .
five years later she wakes from a coma and seeks revenge on those responsible .
the film also stars lucy liu and japanese actor sonny chiba .
she is my marlene dietrich quentin tarantino on uma thurman pictures from kill bill premiere tarantino is best known for reservoir dogs and pulp fiction , both of which have become cult classics .
kill bill , which is only his fourth film to date , mixes various film genres and styles , featuring black and white sequences as well as japanese anime .
it is also his most violent film to date , according to early reviews , with lengthy samurai sword fights and a high body count .
tarantino said he took him a year to write just one fight scene .
the scene , in which thurman tackles 88 adversaries , took eight weeks to shoot .
" i wanted to make the most exciting sequence in cinema " he said .
he said the film was meant as a " black comedy " .
" i have done violence before but never in such an outrageous way .
not that i have any problem with violence if it is n't outrageous . "
blood-thirsty in one bloody set piece , thurman 's character takes on a small army of samurai warriors single-handedly .
he said he was inspired by japanese cinema and that he wanted the film to be a " great night at the movies " .
movie maverick quentin tarantino profiled " it is the standard staple of japanese cinema to cut someone 's arm of and have them have waterhoses for veins , " he said , explaining the blood-thirsty nature of the movie .
explaining his favoured style of movie-making , he said : " i like movies about people who break rules , who are mavericks . "
a second instalment of the film will follow next year , after tarantino and studio miramax opted to split kill bill in two after they found the finished production lasted over three hours .
delayed production miramax was worried it would lose ticket sales on account of the length , but executives were reluctant to cut any scenes from the film .
tarantino said of his lead actress : " she is my marlene dietrich . "
the director had delayed production of the film for six months while thurman was pregnant .
thurman said she was " pleased , amazed and overwhelmed " that tarantino would hold up the film for her .
" it is a testament to his friendship , patience and general goodness , " she said .
volume 1 is released in london from 9 october , with the rest of the uk following on 17 october .
the second film is due for release in february 2004 .

they joined the film 's co-stars julie dreyfus , darryl hannah and michael madsen for the british opening of tarantino 's controversial martial arts movie .
the director defended the film against accusations of graphic violence , saying it was so outlandish and bloody that it was obviously set in " fantasy land " .
" this is definitely not taking place on planet earth , " he said .
tarantino 's first movie since 1997 's jackie brown has already been hailed as a masterpiece by us critics .
the film , inspired in part by martial arts films of the 1970s , stars thurman as the bride , an elite assassin who is shot on her wedding day and left for dead by her boss bill , played by veteran actor david carradine .
five years later she wakes from a coma and seeks revenge on those responsible .
the film also stars lucy liu and japanese actor sonny chiba .
she is my marlene dietrich quentin tarantino on uma thurman pictures from kill bill premiere tarantino is best known for reservoir dogs and pulp fiction , both of which have become cult classics .
kill bill , which is only his fourth film to date , mixes various film genres and styles , featuring black and white sequences as well as japanese anime .
it is also his most violent film to date , according to early reviews , with lengthy samurai sword fights and a high body count .
tarantino said he took him a year to write just one fight scene .
the scene , in which thurman tackles 88 adversaries , took eight weeks to shoot .
" i wanted to make the most exciting sequence in cinema " he said .
he said the film was meant as a " black comedy " .
" i have done violence before but never in such an outrageous way .
not that i have any problem with violence if it is n't outrageous . "
blood-thirsty in one bloody set piece , thurman 's character takes on a small army of samurai warriors single-handedly .
he said he was inspired by japanese cinema and that he wanted the film to be a " great night at the movies " .
movie maverick quentin tarantino profiled " it is the standard staple of japanese cinema to cut someone 's arm of and have them have waterhoses for veins , " he said , explaining the blood-thirsty nature of the movie .
explaining his favoured style of movie-making , he said : " i like movies about people who break rules , who are mavericks . "
a second instalment of the film will follow next year , after tarantino and studio miramax opted to split kill bill in two after they found the finished production lasted over three hours .
delayed production miramax was worried it would lose ticket sales on account of the length , but executives were reluctant to cut any scenes from the film .
tarantino said of his lead actress : " she is my marlene dietrich . "

the display tells the story of a 13-year-old dutch-jewish girl who hid in an attic in amsterdam to escape the nazis during world war ii .
she kept a diary of her cramped life but was eventually betrayed by a neighbour or policeman , and died in a concentration camp .
anne 's teenage diary has been translated into dozens of languages and read by millions worldwide .
the exhibition offers visitors a chance to challenge the concepts of racism and prejudice and encourages and promotes tolerance , democracy , human rights and respect for others .
the exhibition will be opened by edith burkin - a holocaust survivor who settled in herefordshire .
other people attending the launch will include paul oppenheimer who , like anne frank , was taken from his home in holland by the nazis and imran khan , the lawyer for stephen lawrence who was murdered by racists in london .
when the exhibition was in worcester , more than 18,000 visitors came to the city 's cathedral , twice the number predicted .
organisers at hereford cathedral are hoping for a similar response .

aleks krotoski gets ' very excited ' about games while the games industry is churning out better , brighter games , mobile makers are coming out with more colour-screened handsets on which to play them .
both sides of the industry are hoping mobiles will drive more women to gaming because they are easy to use .
but games makers still have to break some of the stereotypical ideas about which games will appeal to men and women , say experts .
better and brighter ?
industry analysts suggest mobile gaming in the uk will be worth more than £ 50 million in 2003 , with that figure rising to more than £ 211 million by 2006 .
with about 75 % of the uk population owning a mobile , it is a big market to capture , says julian bright of total telecom magazine .
" mobile games providers have access to a huge potential user base of both sexes , but so far there 's still only a small proportion of women gamers , " he told bbc news online .
do games on mobile phones appeal to women ?
send us your comments .
there is even a uk mobile games championship on 16 october , where 10 top regional thumb bandits will battling it out to become the country 's first ever mobile games champion .
the host of the event , presenter aleks krotoski , believes women will be driven to mobile gaming by its simplicity and convenience .
a study in the us recently said women are the number one gamers .
but if you look at it , they are playing games like backgammon and solitaire , the more traditional games aleks krotoski , games expert as people generally feel more at home with gadgets like mobiles , they will experiment more and want to do different things on them .
games on handheld devices like phones make the world of gaming more accessible , easy , immediate and straightforward , she says .
" mobiles have a really simple interface , so you do n't need to learn anything else .
you do n't have to learn a new language , it is just applying your thumbs to different patterns , " she told bbc news online .
" people can pick them up and play immediately . "
but , although there are some good examples of appealing games , aleks thinks the games industry is still not shifting many boundaries in the titles they are offering .
lara croft : tomb raider which launched in september for those with vodafone live , is still about pert bottoms and pert breasts .
" it 's brilliant , " says aleks , " mobile users are getting such a good game , but it 's not really breaking the boundary .
" games makers are churning out the old standards , " at the moment , the manufacturers of devices like gameboy advance and mobiles are pushing the boundaries , not the games industry itself .
" one of the biggest challenges is convincing the big wigs they do n't have to market games in general to men only , " says aleks .
" major manufacturers say they wo n't get their games on the shelves if they do n't say they are for men . "
minority report game makers are more aware that the simple and familiar games like pacman for mobiles which will appeal and drive women - and men - to their mobiles .
pacman on the mobile is familiar and simple " a study in the us recently said women are the number one gamers .
but if you look at it , they are playing games like backgammon and solitaire , the more traditional games , " explains aleks .
the survey by the us games industry analysts , the entertainment software association , showed adult women now make up a larger percentage of the gaming population than boys aged six to 17 .
at a recent mobile games conference , mark stanger from developers eidos suggested 82 % of uk mobile gamers were male , while 92 % of playstation 2 players are men .
" if his figures are correct , then mobiles and handhelds appear to be encouraging some more women to play , " says mr bright .
" maybe because they can do so without having to venture into the male-dominated milieu of the gaming shop , and can select games offered by the mobile operator that appeal without having to buy into expensive consoles .
" but they 're still very much in the minority . "
do you think mobile phone games have a wider appeal , especially to women , than console games ?
in my my family it is 50-50 .
my son loves to play computer games on the pc and his mobile , my wife and daughter also love them , although not the same games .
my son loves shoot-em-up games whilst my daughter and wife prefer more gentle type games .
the only thing in common is tetris .
one last point , i do n't play computer games at all and would not even have one loaded to my pc .
colin b , london , uk it does n't matter what platform the game is on , if it is n't a good game or does n't appeal to the correct audience it shall never succeed luke stedman , england mobile games appeal has nothing to do with simplicity - women are just too busy working , running the household , raising the kids etc .
it 's only men that have the time to play games .
liz nicholson , england i have been working in the computer games industry for nearly nine years .
when i started in 1995 computer games were still considered something only geeks did and this was mainly young men , even most of my friends at the time would comment on the fact that i made games for a living was a nerd thing to do and very very rarely would you find a female interested as it was n't to do with fashion or things they liked .
now in 2003 computer games are fashionable and thus this is being picked up and tried by more people than ever .
all of those friends who would take the mickey now have pc 's and playstations and all have mobile phones and now play more games than i ever have .
so i think the key is fashion , mobile phones are fashionable and as such now the user base is bigger than ever before , for men and women .
consoles even though fashionable still have only a fraction of the user base that mobile phones have and as such will never be as popular .
rabs , uk it does n't matter what platform the game is on , if it is n't a good game or does n't appeal to the correct audience it shall never succeed .
luke stedman , england i am a female gamer and have been since the days of the zx spectrum .
i think there are several points here : on the whole -lrb- not just with games -rrb- women are more the problem solvers than men , they think more logically .
so puzzle games like pacman and tetris for example do appeal more to women rather than your football / fighting games that men prefer .
women also have a time issue with playing games .
they work during the day and then get home and their priorities are housework / looking after children / cooking dinner .
they do n't have the time / desire to just sit down and play all evening .
women have better things to spend their money on than games .
why spend £ 40 on a game when you can buy a new top / pair of shoes .
therefore i think that mobile gaming will probably draw more female gamers , because they can play their puzzle games , on the go , for little expense .
perfect !
disclaimer - i love fighting games , never do the housework , and spend all my money on games sarah , england mobile phones are becoming ever more targeted at women , not only for games , the latest technology being developed is to make the screen into a mirror , for make-up application .
stuart f , uk i agree that we as developers need to think more about what women would find interesting and exciting .
but it may just be that gaming will always be a male dominated activity .
john ozimek , uk i work at one of the uk 's leading mobile games companies , and we are proof of the interest in mobile gaming from a new generation of consumers .
however , i must disagree with many of the facts in the article .
although the industry is very conscious of the potential for mobile games to have more of a unisex appeal than in the past , it is very hard to find any statistics to show women actually buying and playing mobile games .
simple games such as backgammon or snake are great , but are usually pre-installed on the phone - the mobile gaming industry is about getting people to download and pay for games , and it is this part of gaming that girls are not doing as much as boys .
a good example is japan , the largest and most developed games market in the world right now .
statistics showed that girls made up over 90 % of the people downloading pictures and ringtones of certain cartoon characters : but when it came to downloading games based on the same cartoons , less than 1 % were girls .
i wish i had some easy answers , and i agree that we as developers need to think more about what women would find interesting and exciting .
but it may just be that gaming will always be a male dominated activity ; aleks krotoski 's comments are at best naive at at worst unhelpful and plain wrong .
john ozimek , uk if i was to be equally as sexist , i could comment that the reason women do n't play video games as much is because they are " too busy " watching all the soaps on tv stuart scott , uk i 'm mildly shocked by some of the comments by women here .
" women are just too busy ? "
my wife has more time at home than i do -lrb- by about three to four hours a day -rrb- .
we do equal share of the household chores , etc .
she does play games , but this is limited mainly to the sims and mainly to weekends .
i sometimes play games when i get home to unwind and i generally spend more time playing games than she does .
if i was to be equally as sexist , i could comment that the reason women do n't play video games as much is because they are " too busy " watching all the soaps on tv .
stuart scott , uk it 's not about appeal , it 's about availability and convenience .
practically everyone owns a mobile phone and everyone has spare moments waiting for a train or something similar .
playing with your mobile in some form or another seems a logical time-wasting exercise for everyone , surely ?
stephen farrugia , malta the mass appeal of mobile gaming to the female community is of concern to developers .
the male market demands more complex , demanding and challenging titles , some games these days require upwards of 20 hours for completion .
could these games simply be aimed towards the fairer sex ?
growing up with gaming over the past 15 years has taught us ' males ' the in 's and out 's of the developers minds .
new gamers will struggle .
as a direct result , games considered ' simple ' may lose their appeal .
question is , should games be released that are classed female or male ?

now in 2003 computer games are fashionable and thus this is being picked up and tried by more people than ever .
all of those friends who would take the mickey now have pc 's and playstations and all have mobile phones and now play more games than i ever have .

i think there are several points here : on the whole -lrb- not just with games -rrb- women are more the problem solvers than men , they think more logically .

women also have a time issue with playing games .
they work during the day and then get home and their priorities are housework / looking after children / cooking dinner .
they do n't have the time / desire to just sit down and play all evening .
women have better things to spend their money on than games .
why spend £ 40 on a game when you can buy a new top / pair of shoes .

you do n't have to learn a new language , it is just applying your thumbs to different patterns , " she told bbc news online .
" people can pick them up and play immediately . "
but , although there are some good examples of appealing games , aleks thinks the games industry is still not shifting many boundaries in the titles they are offering .
lara croft : tomb raider which launched in september for those with vodafone live , is still about pert bottoms and pert breasts .
" it 's brilliant , " says aleks , " mobile users are getting such a good game , but it 's not really breaking the boundary .
" games makers are churning out the old standards , " at the moment , the manufacturers of devices like gameboy advance and mobiles are pushing the boundaries , not the games industry itself .
" one of the biggest challenges is convincing the big wigs they do n't have to market games in general to men only , " says aleks .
" major manufacturers say they wo n't get their games on the shelves if they do n't say they are for men . "
minority report game makers are more aware that the simple and familiar games like pacman for mobiles which will appeal and drive women - and men - to their mobiles .
pacman on the mobile is familiar and simple " a study in the us recently said women are the number one gamers .
but if you look at it , they are playing games like backgammon and solitaire , the more traditional games , " explains aleks .
the survey by the us games industry analysts , the entertainment software association , showed adult women now make up a larger percentage of the gaming population than boys aged six to 17 .
at a recent mobile games conference , mark stanger from developers eidos suggested 82 % of uk mobile gamers were male , while 92 % of playstation 2 players are men .
" if his figures are correct , then mobiles and handhelds appear to be encouraging some more women to play , " says mr bright .
" maybe because they can do so without having to venture into the male-dominated milieu of the gaming shop , and can select games offered by the mobile operator that appeal without having to buy into expensive consoles .
" but they 're still very much in the minority . "
do you think mobile phone games have a wider appeal , especially to women , than console games ?
in my my family it is 50-50 .
my son loves to play computer games on the pc and his mobile , my wife and daughter also love them , although not the same games .
my son loves shoot-em-up games whilst my daughter and wife prefer more gentle type games .
the only thing in common is tetris .
one last point , i do n't play computer games at all and would not even have one loaded to my pc .

it 's only men that have the time to play games .
liz nicholson , england i have been working in the computer games industry for nearly nine years .
when i started in 1995 computer games were still considered something only geeks did and this was mainly young men , even most of my friends at the time would comment on the fact that i made games for a living was a nerd thing to do and very very rarely would you find a female interested as it was n't to do with fashion or things they liked .
now in 2003 computer games are fashionable and thus this is being picked up and tried by more people than ever .
all of those friends who would take the mickey now have pc 's and playstations and all have mobile phones and now play more games than i ever have .
so i think the key is fashion , mobile phones are fashionable and as such now the user base is bigger than ever before , for men and women .
consoles even though fashionable still have only a fraction of the user base that mobile phones have and as such will never be as popular .
rabs , uk it does n't matter what platform the game is on , if it is n't a good game or does n't appeal to the correct audience it shall never succeed .
luke stedman , england i am a female gamer and have been since the days of the zx spectrum .
i think there are several points here : on the whole -lrb- not just with games -rrb- women are more the problem solvers than men , they think more logically .
so puzzle games like pacman and tetris for example do appeal more to women rather than your football / fighting games that men prefer .
women also have a time issue with playing games .
they work during the day and then get home and their priorities are housework / looking after children / cooking dinner .
they do n't have the time / desire to just sit down and play all evening .
women have better things to spend their money on than games .
why spend £ 40 on a game when you can buy a new top / pair of shoes .
therefore i think that mobile gaming will probably draw more female gamers , because they can play their puzzle games , on the go , for little expense .

better and brighter ?
industry analysts suggest mobile gaming in the uk will be worth more than £ 50 million in 2003 , with that figure rising to more than £ 211 million by 2006 .
with about 75 % of the uk population owning a mobile , it is a big market to capture , says julian bright of total telecom magazine .
" mobile games providers have access to a huge potential user base of both sexes , but so far there 's still only a small proportion of women gamers , " he told bbc news online .
do games on mobile phones appeal to women ?
send us your comments .
there is even a uk mobile games championship on 16 october , where 10 top regional thumb bandits will battling it out to become the country 's first ever mobile games champion .
the host of the event , presenter aleks krotoski , believes women will be driven to mobile gaming by its simplicity and convenience .
a study in the us recently said women are the number one gamers .
but if you look at it , they are playing games like backgammon and solitaire , the more traditional games aleks krotoski , games expert as people generally feel more at home with gadgets like mobiles , they will experiment more and want to do different things on them .
games on handheld devices like phones make the world of gaming more accessible , easy , immediate and straightforward , she says .
" mobiles have a really simple interface , so you do n't need to learn anything else .
you do n't have to learn a new language , it is just applying your thumbs to different patterns , " she told bbc news online .
" people can pick them up and play immediately . "
but , although there are some good examples of appealing games , aleks thinks the games industry is still not shifting many boundaries in the titles they are offering .
lara croft : tomb raider which launched in september for those with vodafone live , is still about pert bottoms and pert breasts .
" it 's brilliant , " says aleks , " mobile users are getting such a good game , but it 's not really breaking the boundary .
" games makers are churning out the old standards , " at the moment , the manufacturers of devices like gameboy advance and mobiles are pushing the boundaries , not the games industry itself .
" one of the biggest challenges is convincing the big wigs they do n't have to market games in general to men only , " says aleks .
" major manufacturers say they wo n't get their games on the shelves if they do n't say they are for men . "
minority report game makers are more aware that the simple and familiar games like pacman for mobiles which will appeal and drive women - and men - to their mobiles .
pacman on the mobile is familiar and simple " a study in the us recently said women are the number one gamers .
but if you look at it , they are playing games like backgammon and solitaire , the more traditional games , " explains aleks .
the survey by the us games industry analysts , the entertainment software association , showed adult women now make up a larger percentage of the gaming population than boys aged six to 17 .
at a recent mobile games conference , mark stanger from developers eidos suggested 82 % of uk mobile gamers were male , while 92 % of playstation 2 players are men .
" if his figures are correct , then mobiles and handhelds appear to be encouraging some more women to play , " says mr bright .
" maybe because they can do so without having to venture into the male-dominated milieu of the gaming shop , and can select games offered by the mobile operator that appeal without having to buy into expensive consoles .
" but they 're still very much in the minority . "
do you think mobile phone games have a wider appeal , especially to women , than console games ?
in my my family it is 50-50 .
my son loves to play computer games on the pc and his mobile , my wife and daughter also love them , although not the same games .
my son loves shoot-em-up games whilst my daughter and wife prefer more gentle type games .
the only thing in common is tetris .
one last point , i do n't play computer games at all and would not even have one loaded to my pc .
colin b , london , uk it does n't matter what platform the game is on , if it is n't a good game or does n't appeal to the correct audience it shall never succeed luke stedman , england mobile games appeal has nothing to do with simplicity - women are just too busy working , running the household , raising the kids etc .
it 's only men that have the time to play games .
liz nicholson , england i have been working in the computer games industry for nearly nine years .
when i started in 1995 computer games were still considered something only geeks did and this was mainly young men , even most of my friends at the time would comment on the fact that i made games for a living was a nerd thing to do and very very rarely would you find a female interested as it was n't to do with fashion or things they liked .
now in 2003 computer games are fashionable and thus this is being picked up and tried by more people than ever .
all of those friends who would take the mickey now have pc 's and playstations and all have mobile phones and now play more games than i ever have .
so i think the key is fashion , mobile phones are fashionable and as such now the user base is bigger than ever before , for men and women .
consoles even though fashionable still have only a fraction of the user base that mobile phones have and as such will never be as popular .
rabs , uk it does n't matter what platform the game is on , if it is n't a good game or does n't appeal to the correct audience it shall never succeed .
luke stedman , england i am a female gamer and have been since the days of the zx spectrum .
i think there are several points here : on the whole -lrb- not just with games -rrb- women are more the problem solvers than men , they think more logically .
so puzzle games like pacman and tetris for example do appeal more to women rather than your football / fighting games that men prefer .
women also have a time issue with playing games .
they work during the day and then get home and their priorities are housework / looking after children / cooking dinner .
they do n't have the time / desire to just sit down and play all evening .
women have better things to spend their money on than games .
why spend £ 40 on a game when you can buy a new top / pair of shoes .
therefore i think that mobile gaming will probably draw more female gamers , because they can play their puzzle games , on the go , for little expense .
perfect !
disclaimer - i love fighting games , never do the housework , and spend all my money on games sarah , england mobile phones are becoming ever more targeted at women , not only for games , the latest technology being developed is to make the screen into a mirror , for make-up application .
stuart f , uk i agree that we as developers need to think more about what women would find interesting and exciting .
but it may just be that gaming will always be a male dominated activity .
john ozimek , uk i work at one of the uk 's leading mobile games companies , and we are proof of the interest in mobile gaming from a new generation of consumers .
however , i must disagree with many of the facts in the article .
although the industry is very conscious of the potential for mobile games to have more of a unisex appeal than in the past , it is very hard to find any statistics to show women actually buying and playing mobile games .
simple games such as backgammon or snake are great , but are usually pre-installed on the phone - the mobile gaming industry is about getting people to download and pay for games , and it is this part of gaming that girls are not doing as much as boys .
a good example is japan , the largest and most developed games market in the world right now .
statistics showed that girls made up over 90 % of the people downloading pictures and ringtones of certain cartoon characters : but when it came to downloading games based on the same cartoons , less than 1 % were girls .
i wish i had some easy answers , and i agree that we as developers need to think more about what women would find interesting and exciting .
but it may just be that gaming will always be a male dominated activity ; aleks krotoski 's comments are at best naive at at worst unhelpful and plain wrong .
john ozimek , uk if i was to be equally as sexist , i could comment that the reason women do n't play video games as much is because they are " too busy " watching all the soaps on tv stuart scott , uk i 'm mildly shocked by some of the comments by women here .
" women are just too busy ? "
my wife has more time at home than i do -lrb- by about three to four hours a day -rrb- .
we do equal share of the household chores , etc .
she does play games , but this is limited mainly to the sims and mainly to weekends .
i sometimes play games when i get home to unwind and i generally spend more time playing games than she does .
if i was to be equally as sexist , i could comment that the reason women do n't play video games as much is because they are " too busy " watching all the soaps on tv .
stuart scott , uk it 's not about appeal , it 's about availability and convenience .
practically everyone owns a mobile phone and everyone has spare moments waiting for a train or something similar .
playing with your mobile in some form or another seems a logical time-wasting exercise for everyone , surely ?
stephen farrugia , malta the mass appeal of mobile gaming to the female community is of concern to developers .
the male market demands more complex , demanding and challenging titles , some games these days require upwards of 20 hours for completion .
could these games simply be aimed towards the fairer sex ?
growing up with gaming over the past 15 years has taught us ' males ' the in 's and out 's of the developers minds .
new gamers will struggle .
as a direct result , games considered ' simple ' may lose their appeal .
question is , should games be released that are classed female or male ?

aleks krotoski gets ' very excited ' about games while the games industry is churning out better , brighter games , mobile makers are coming out with more colour-screened handsets on which to play them .
both sides of the industry are hoping mobiles will drive more women to gaming because they are easy to use .
but games makers still have to break some of the stereotypical ideas about which games will appeal to men and women , say experts .
better and brighter ?
industry analysts suggest mobile gaming in the uk will be worth more than £ 50 million in 2003 , with that figure rising to more than £ 211 million by 2006 .
with about 75 % of the uk population owning a mobile , it is a big market to capture , says julian bright of total telecom magazine .
" mobile games providers have access to a huge potential user base of both sexes , but so far there 's still only a small proportion of women gamers , " he told bbc news online .
do games on mobile phones appeal to women ?
send us your comments .
there is even a uk mobile games championship on 16 october , where 10 top regional thumb bandits will battling it out to become the country 's first ever mobile games champion .
the host of the event , presenter aleks krotoski , believes women will be driven to mobile gaming by its simplicity and convenience .
a study in the us recently said women are the number one gamers .
but if you look at it , they are playing games like backgammon and solitaire , the more traditional games aleks krotoski , games expert as people generally feel more at home with gadgets like mobiles , they will experiment more and want to do different things on them .
games on handheld devices like phones make the world of gaming more accessible , easy , immediate and straightforward , she says .
" mobiles have a really simple interface , so you do n't need to learn anything else .
you do n't have to learn a new language , it is just applying your thumbs to different patterns , " she told bbc news online .
" people can pick them up and play immediately . "
but , although there are some good examples of appealing games , aleks thinks the games industry is still not shifting many boundaries in the titles they are offering .
lara croft : tomb raider which launched in september for those with vodafone live , is still about pert bottoms and pert breasts .
" it 's brilliant , " says aleks , " mobile users are getting such a good game , but it 's not really breaking the boundary .
" games makers are churning out the old standards , " at the moment , the manufacturers of devices like gameboy advance and mobiles are pushing the boundaries , not the games industry itself .
" one of the biggest challenges is convincing the big wigs they do n't have to market games in general to men only , " says aleks .
" major manufacturers say they wo n't get their games on the shelves if they do n't say they are for men . "
minority report game makers are more aware that the simple and familiar games like pacman for mobiles which will appeal and drive women - and men - to their mobiles .
pacman on the mobile is familiar and simple " a study in the us recently said women are the number one gamers .
but if you look at it , they are playing games like backgammon and solitaire , the more traditional games , " explains aleks .
the survey by the us games industry analysts , the entertainment software association , showed adult women now make up a larger percentage of the gaming population than boys aged six to 17 .
at a recent mobile games conference , mark stanger from developers eidos suggested 82 % of uk mobile gamers were male , while 92 % of playstation 2 players are men .
" if his figures are correct , then mobiles and handhelds appear to be encouraging some more women to play , " says mr bright .
" maybe because they can do so without having to venture into the male-dominated milieu of the gaming shop , and can select games offered by the mobile operator that appeal without having to buy into expensive consoles .
" but they 're still very much in the minority . "
do you think mobile phone games have a wider appeal , especially to women , than console games ?
in my my family it is 50-50 .
my son loves to play computer games on the pc and his mobile , my wife and daughter also love them , although not the same games .
my son loves shoot-em-up games whilst my daughter and wife prefer more gentle type games .
the only thing in common is tetris .
one last point , i do n't play computer games at all and would not even have one loaded to my pc .
colin b , london , uk it does n't matter what platform the game is on , if it is n't a good game or does n't appeal to the correct audience it shall never succeed luke stedman , england mobile games appeal has nothing to do with simplicity - women are just too busy working , running the household , raising the kids etc .
it 's only men that have the time to play games .
liz nicholson , england i have been working in the computer games industry for nearly nine years .
when i started in 1995 computer games were still considered something only geeks did and this was mainly young men , even most of my friends at the time would comment on the fact that i made games for a living was a nerd thing to do and very very rarely would you find a female interested as it was n't to do with fashion or things they liked .
now in 2003 computer games are fashionable and thus this is being picked up and tried by more people than ever .
all of those friends who would take the mickey now have pc 's and playstations and all have mobile phones and now play more games than i ever have .
so i think the key is fashion , mobile phones are fashionable and as such now the user base is bigger than ever before , for men and women .
consoles even though fashionable still have only a fraction of the user base that mobile phones have and as such will never be as popular .
rabs , uk it does n't matter what platform the game is on , if it is n't a good game or does n't appeal to the correct audience it shall never succeed .
luke stedman , england i am a female gamer and have been since the days of the zx spectrum .
i think there are several points here : on the whole -lrb- not just with games -rrb- women are more the problem solvers than men , they think more logically .
so puzzle games like pacman and tetris for example do appeal more to women rather than your football / fighting games that men prefer .
women also have a time issue with playing games .
they work during the day and then get home and their priorities are housework / looking after children / cooking dinner .
they do n't have the time / desire to just sit down and play all evening .
women have better things to spend their money on than games .
why spend £ 40 on a game when you can buy a new top / pair of shoes .
therefore i think that mobile gaming will probably draw more female gamers , because they can play their puzzle games , on the go , for little expense .
perfect !

the orgy , allegedly involving about 400 japanese tourists and 500 chinese prostitutes , took place last month at a luxury hotel in the southern chinese city of zhuhai .
some commentators labelled zhuhai a ' national disgrace ' since details came to light , police have rounded up many of those involved , including more than 50 prostitutes , a nightclub madame and several pimps , according to a local newspaper .
but local journalists say they have been told to restrict their reporting of the orgy for fear of giving the wrong impression of life in the new , freewheeling china .
publicly , the government is blaming japan for the three-day orgy , and has demanded that it take steps to " educate " its citizens about how to behave abroad .
like everything else these days , sex is a matter of supply and demand wei hui , novelist the foreign ministry in beijing expressed its " utmost indignation " to tokyo over what it called the " odious " incident , which coincided - intentionally or otherwise - with the anniversary of japan 's invasion of north eastern china in 1931 .
tens of thousands of chinese internet users also took out their fury on the japanese , calling them " animals " and recalling such wartime atrocities as the nanjing massacre , or rape of nanking , in which an estimated 300,000 chinese were killed and 20,000 women raped .
a number of elderly chinese women are still seeking compensation from japan for having been forced to become sex slaves , or " comfort women " .
but this time , some chinese are saying that their own country should be feeling just as ashamed as japan .
unless china wants to acquire a reputation as a sleazy haven for sex tourists , they say , it should be learning something from the latest incident itself rather than blaming foreigners .
japanese men are not the only ones at fault here " , according to wei hui , a shanghai-based novelist .
" they may have a bad reputation abroad as womanisers but , after all , it takes two to tango .
standing up for reform " like everything else these days , sex is a matter of supply and demand . "
the free-market reforms of recent years have brought a proliferation of sex workers from poor outlying provinces to china 's booming eastern cities .
poor girls from the countryside selling themselves to foreign businessmen xue xinran , author of the good women of china in the early years of communist rule the government claimed to have completely eliminated prostitution .
but today the social divisions - and the red light districts - are bigger than ever , says xue xinran - author of the good women of china .
" if you go to these modern hotels in china 's south you will see thousands of poor girls from the countryside openly selling themselves to visiting businessmen from hong kong , taiwan , japan and elsewhere " , ms xue told bbc news online .
she compared the situation today with that of pre-communist shanghai in the 1930s , with its 30,000 prostitutes and its countless nicknames such as " paris of the east " and " whore of asia " .
today 's zhuhai understandably strives for a different image , describing itself as a " new garden seaside city ... standing up in the trend of china 's reform and opening up " .
in fact it has been receiving sex tours for years .
" over the years zhuhai residents have grown oblivious to the sight of busloads of up to 100 ' hostesses ' arriving at hotels , " said a visitor this week .
officials for the most part tolerate such practices because of the boost to the local economy , says kevin lau , a journalist based in hong kong .
it is an attitude known as " one eye open , one eye closed " , he says .
new campaign but according to reports from hong kong , the communist party secretary of guangdong province is now under heavy pressure from beijing to investigate last month 's incident and carry out a thorough crackdown on all prostitution .
a new round of an ideological campaign to promote " spiritual civilisation " , or officially approved morality , is expected to be introduced soon .
prostitutes detained by police at such times are usually sent for " long-term rehabilitation " to labour camps .
but such crackdowns rarely achieve much , according to dr phil deans , director of the contemporary china institute at soas london university .
