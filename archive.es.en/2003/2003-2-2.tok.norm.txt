streamium mc-i200 boxes went on sale in the uk in january and they are designed for home users with fast broadband internet connections .
the internet radio sounds good and provides a living room friendly front end to the kind of playlist personalisation already offered to people who listen to music stations on their desktop computers .
but there are a number of limitations which give the box the feel of a technology demonstration rather than a mature product .
routers , wires and choice it requires users to have a router installed on their broadband connection , something which will add another £ 100 or so to the unit 's £ 400 cost .
a new version supporting wireless networking is due out later in the year .
the current version runs on a standard wired network , so it needs a network cable between it and the router .
rather than give access to all the thousands of audio streams on the internet , the radio currently works only with a small range of stations who have done a deal with philips .

personalisation charge the radio really comes into its own when used with a streaming service like musicmatch , which offers users the chance to select the performers they like and have similar music suggested to them .
a random selection of tracks from these artists then form a personalised radio station .
listeners create their own stations via the web the service requires a modest subscription - the rest of the audio provided by the streamium costs nothing once the unit is paid for - and it is the same as the service provided by musicmatch to computer users .
philips clearly hopes that the attraction of having good quality sound from a unit that looks like a piece of audio kit rather than a computer add-on will be enough to sell the streamium to early adopters .
the set up procedure appears well thought out .
once the box is plugged in , there is very little data entry to be done via the box itself .
once the user has logged on , the selection and customisation of playlists is done via a personal page on the philips website .
the box also plays mp3s from cd-r and cd-rw .
other electronics manufacturers including at least two small uk firms have similar products in the pipeline .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- remains found among shuttle debris bbc news bbc sport > > graphics version > > change to uk edition > > news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- entertainment -pipe- science / nature -pipe- technology -pipe- health -pipe- talking point sunday , 2 february , 2003 , 09:35 gmt remains found among shuttle debris human remains have been found among the debris left by the us space shuttle columbia , which disintegrated just minutes before its scheduled landing .
all seven astronauts on board were killed when the craft broke up after re-entering the earth 's atmosphere on saturday .
two technical inquiries are opening into the disaster - the american space agency nasa will conduct an investigation , and so will an independent board .
us president george w bush led the mourning for the crew , killed almost exactly 17 years after the challenger shuttle exploded on lift-off .
shock and grief has been expressed around the world - not just in the us but in india , where one of the crew was born , and in israel , which had hoped to celebrate the return of the first israeli astronaut .
mr bush ordered flags to fly at half-mast on government buildings around the us .
but in a televised address he pledged that the " journey into space will go on " .
the future of the shuttle programme - and of nasa 's manned space exploration - remains unclear .
but russia said a planned launch of a cargo vessel to serve the international space station will go ahead on sunday .
sensor malfunction nasa said it did not yet know what caused the break-up of the shuttle 40 miles -lrb- 65 kilometres -rrb- above the earth . "
we ca n't rush to judgement " ron dittemore , nasa shuttle manager problems were first noticed when sensors on the left wing malfunctioned 23 minutes before the scheduled touchdown and six minutes before the shuttle disintegrated .
that wing was hit by a piece of insulating foam which peeled away from the external fuel tank a little more than a minute into columbia 's launch on 16 january .
the incident was spotted and checked but nasa said there was no reason to be concerned about the tiles which cover the shuttle to protect it from the extreme heat of re-entry .
hours after the disaster , nasa shuttle manager ron dittemore said : " as we look at that now in hindsight ... we ca n't discount that there might be a connection .
" but ... we ca n't rush to judgement on it because there are a lot of things in this business that look like the smoking gun but turn out not even to be close . "
shuttle crew commander rick husband , us pilot william mccool , us michael anderson , us david brown , us kalpana chawla , us laurel clark , us ilan ramon , israel experts have suggested that the problems are likely to have been mechanical or structural .
a key part of the investigation - which will likely take months to complete - will be analysing the pieces of the shuttle which rained down from a clear blue sky over the southern us .
body parts believed to be from the astronauts have been recovered near hemphill in eastern texas near the state 's border with louisiana along with a helmet and uniform badges .
the remains have been removed for dna testing . "
the columbia is lost ; there are no survivors " president bush mr bush praised the astronauts for their " high and noble purpose in life " .
large parts of the shuttle have been found about 30 miles -lrb- 50km -rrb- away in nacogdoches but the debris is spread over a huge area .
debris injuries at least eight people in hemphill needed hospital treatment for burns and breathing problems after getting too close to pieces of the wreckage .
nasa warned that any debris found should be avoided as it could be hazardous .
first flight : 1981 orbiting speed : 17,500 mph weight : 2,000 tonnes crew -lrb- for this mission -rrb- : 7 columbia , had been due to land at 0916 est -lrb- 1416 gmt -rrb- at the end of a 16-day mission .
contact was lost at about 0900 est .
nasa said the shuttle was about 200,000 feet up and travelling at 12,500 mph -lrb- 20,000 km / h -rrb- at the time .
television pictures showed a vapour trail from the craft as it flew over dallas .
it then appeared to disintegrate into several separate vapour trails , and witnesses in the area said they heard " big bangs " which also shook their homes .
never before in 42 years of human spaceflight , has nasa lost a space crew during landing .
in 1986 , the space shuttle challenger exploded shortly after lift-off with the loss of all seven crew on board .

all seven astronauts on board were killed when the craft broke up after re-entering the earth 's atmosphere on saturday .
a piece of foam hit the shuttle 's left wing shortly after lift-off two technical inquiries are opening into the disaster - the american space agency nasa will conduct an investigation , and so will an independent board .
us president george w bush led the mourning for the crew , killed almost exactly 17 years after the challenger shuttle exploded on lift-off .
shock and grief has been expressed around the world - not just in the us but in india , where one of the crew was born , and in israel , which had hoped to celebrate the return of the first israeli astronaut . : shuttle disaster how the disaster happened mr bush ordered flags to fly at half-mast on government buildings around the us .

but russia said a planned launch of a cargo vessel to serve the international space station will go ahead on sunday .
sensor malfunction nasa said it did not yet know what caused the break-up of the shuttle 40 miles -lrb- 65 kilometres -rrb- above the earth .
we ca n't rush to judgement ron dittemore , nasa shuttle manager problems were first noticed when sensors on the left wing malfunctioned 23 minutes before the scheduled touchdown and six minutes before the shuttle disintegrated .
that wing was hit by a piece of insulating foam which peeled away from the external fuel tank a little more than a minute into columbia 's launch on 16 january .
the incident was spotted and checked but nasa said there was no reason to be concerned about the tiles which cover the shuttle to protect it from the extreme heat of re-entry .

" but ... we ca n't rush to judgement on it because there are a lot of things in this business that look like the smoking gun but turn out not even to be close . "
shuttle crew commander rick husband , us pilot william mccool , us michael anderson , us david brown , us kalpana chawla , us laurel clark , us ilan ramon , israel click here for profiles experts have suggested that the problems are likely to have been mechanical or structural .
a key part of the investigation - which will likely take months to complete - will be analysing the pieces of the shuttle which rained down from a clear blue sky over the southern us .
body parts believed to be from the astronauts have been recovered near hemphill in eastern texas near the state 's border with louisiana along with a helmet and uniform badges .
the remains have been removed for dna testing .
the columbia is lost ; there are no survivors president bush full text of speech mr bush praised the astronauts for their " high and noble purpose in life " .
large parts of the shuttle have been found about 30 miles -lrb- 50km -rrb- away in nacogdoches but the debris is spread over a huge area .
debris injuries at least eight people in hemphill needed hospital treatment for burns and breathing problems after getting too close to pieces of the wreckage .
nasa warned that any debris found should be avoided as it could be hazardous .
first flight : 1981 orbiting speed : 17,500 mph weight : 2,000 tonnes crew -lrb- for this mission -rrb- : 7 columbia : space pioneer columbia , had been due to land at 0916 est -lrb- 1416 gmt -rrb- at the end of a 16-day mission .
contact was lost at about 0900 est .
nasa said the shuttle was about 200,000 feet up and travelling at 12,500 mph -lrb- 20,000 km / h -rrb- at the time .
television pictures showed a vapour trail from the craft as it flew over dallas .
it then appeared to disintegrate into several separate vapour trails , and witnesses in the area said they heard " big bangs " which also shook their homes .

nine of the 15 votes on the council are needed to get a resolution passed , with no veto from any of the five permanent members .
likely votes for : us , britain , bulgaria , spain , cameroon , guinea , angola and chile unsure : mexico , pakistan , russia abstentions : germany , china against : syria , france it is very possible , if the un inspectors do not give iraq a clean bill of health , that enough votes can be mustered .
the question of a veto , however , remains undetermined .
the following would , or probably would with the right arm-twisting , vote in favour : us , britain , bulgaria , spain , cameroon , guinea , angola and chile .
that is eight .
mexico could bring the total to nine .
pakistan remains doubtful .
syria would vote against .
germany might abstain .
so might china which tends to sit out these kinds of confrontations .
the keys are france and russia , both of whom have a veto .
russia might come on board if the inspectors continue to give iraq low points .
open to persuasion mr blair 's first task will be to tackle french president jacques chirac , with whom he is holding a summit in the french channel resort of le touquet on tuesday .
this meeting was delayed from last year as a result of a row between the two over european farm policy reform , but turns out to come at a very opportune moment .
president chirac has stated that a war against iraq can take place only under un authority .
that is a very different thing from saying that it can not take place at all , which is the german position .
so the french are , in the british view , open to persuasion .
the negative report of the un weapons inspector dr hans blix on 27 january about the level of iraqi co-operation has given the us and britain , which had been on the defensive against a franco-german offensive , the initiative .
even the right-wing french newspaper le figaro says that " paris has probably just lost the pre-war battle " .
the uk prime minister , tony blair , told the bbc that he was " confident " that a second resolution - following up resolution 1441 which referred to unspecified " serious consequences " - can be passed and that he was in " no doubt at all " that president bush wants one as well .
mr bush , however , is a man in a hurry and made it clear after his washington talks with mr blair that the issue of a specific resolution " just needs to be resolved quickly " .
short and sharp in the final analysis , the americans do not really feel they need another resolution .
key dates 5 feb - powell to address un security council 8/9 feb - baradei & blix to have talks in iraq 14 feb - further report from weapons inspectors 27 mar - blix submits new report to un they may not even really want one , but appear ready to go along with the plan .
if it fails , they will act anyway .
there will , therefore , be no seven-week negotiation like the one which preceded the adoption of resolution 1441 .
this time , the resolution will be short and sharp and may well be introduced soon after mr blix reports back to the council on 14 february , especially if he reports no progress .
this would enable the decks to be cleared for action sometime in march .
since military build-ups usually take longer than expected , mid-march seems to be the earliest time .
ideally , the british side would like to see a longer inspection process , but is not committed to any extended timetable and there will certainly be american pressure for a swift decision .
against that , opponents of a war might call for further reports by inspectors and a declaration by them that there is no point in going on .
next steps two events are likely to show which way the issue will go .
the first is on wednesday , when the us secretary of state , colin powell , presents the american case against iraq in open session at the security council .
he is said to be busily declassifying images and documents for his presentation .
satellite photographs of iraqis moving equipment from sites in advance of inspections are said to be among the evidence to be on display .
both the united states and britain have previously accused iraq of having mobile biological warfare laboratories which they move around and if there is sight of these , it will count for something .
but equally , mr powell will have to do a lot to convince the critics .
there is great scepticism of the claim of a clear link between iraq and al-qaeda , for example .
the second event will be on 14 february when mr blix and nuclear chief inspector dr mohamed elbaradei give a new report to the council .
if they can not announce that all is suddenly well , expect the final moves to begin .

north devon district council has produced a set of requirements it expects developers to meet when building new homes .
the proposals include ensuring that between 25 % and 50 % of new houses built are affordable .
housing built in rural areas would also only be made available to local people .
we can not sit back and watch house prices continue to rise and see more and more people struggle to find homes malcolm prowse , north devon district council leader permission would be given for affordable housing to be built on sites in villages and other rural locations where development would not normally be allowed .
it is also proposed that 150 affordable houses are built in the district each year .
the action has been taken because of the increasing housing problems local people are facing due to the rise in property prices .
between 1998 and 2002 , house prices have gone up 82 % in north devon .
there has also been a massive 117 % price rise at the lower end of the housing market .
the lack of affordable homes has led to an increase in the number of people on the housing register .
there are 2,500 people waiting for accommodation , which far outweighs the number of properties available .
direct action council leader malcolm prowse said : " we want to make sure that everyone in north devon has the chance to live in a decent home .
" we can not sit back and watch house prices continue to rise and see more and more people struggle to find homes .
" it 's time to take direct action to ensure this problem does not escalate any further . "
the council says affordable homes should be sold at a price no more than three times the average annual income of local residents .
the average income in devon is currently £ 20,000 .
