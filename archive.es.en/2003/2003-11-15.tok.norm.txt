mr murdoch said he was concerned about more power being given up to europe , and would see if the tories " look like a viable alternative government " .
the sun , britain 's top-selling paper , has backed labour since 1997 , and many mps think its support has been crucial .
but labour mp clive soley said : " papers can make a big difference ... but overall they do n't win elections . "
a labour party spokesman added : " with potentially two years to go before a general election and a new opposition party leader , it is not surprising that -lsb- mr murdoch 's papers -rsb- are taking stock of the political situation .
" we ... are confident that when the next election comes the delivery of improved public services will mean that we deserve the support of news international readers . "

"
mr murdoch told bbc one 's ten o 'clock news " the jury 's out " on whom he would back in the election , expected in about 18 months .
he said he had a " friendly relationship " with both prime minister tony blair , and with new conservative leader michael howard .
" i would say that we 'll have to see how the tory front bench looks , if it looks like a viable alternative government which it has n't so far . "
but he added : " we will not quickly forget the courage of tony blair in the international sphere in the last several months .
" so we may be torn in our decision , but let 's wait and see .
" it 's a long way away , let 's see what the government is doing with europe , lets see how mr howard performs , how the government performs . "
europe concerns mr murdoch warned of the " great dangers " of the controversial new european constitution - to which the government wants to sign up without a referendum .
" i do n't like the idea of any more abdication of our sovereignty in economic affairs or anything else , " he said .
labour fought elections throughout the 1980s with the sun dead against them and they lost them all andrew neil , former sky chairman " we 'll have to see what 's in the final constitution , if it 's anything like the draft then certainly we 'll oppose it . "
bbc political correspondent guto harri said mr murdoch 's comments would make labour " very nervous " .
he said mr murdoch was " in tune " with mr howard on a number of issues such as taxation and europe .

figures released this week show that cable and broadband net service suppliers have had their best three months ever .
more than two million americans bought broadband in the three months to october according to leichtman research .
but analysts warned that the level of growth was unlikely to continue as there was little room left to cut prices and so tempt more customers .
growth curve cable firms signed up the largest share of the two million new subscribers , with 61 % preferring to get their broadband via this route .
part of the growth has been because regional us telephone firms have been running promotions that offer dsl at very low prices .
cable firms responded to these promotions by cutting their own prices and boosting line speeds .
bruce leichtman said most of the growth came from people signing up for the cut price broadband deals .
" without these promotions , this level of growth may prove to be difficult to maintain , " he said .
but despite the growth , most us net users are still dialling up to the net with a modem .
recent growth means that broadband users in the us are hovering just under 40 % of all net users .
but the us is not the only country enjoying a broadband boom .
it is also taking off in china .
according to research by ccid consulting of beijing , the numbers of chinese net users with broadband connections has tripled in just 12 months .
in november 2002 ccid estimates that there were 3.4m chinese broadband users .
by november of this year the figure had climbed to 9.4m.
but despite this rapid increase there is still less than one broadband user for every 1000 chinese people .

figures released this week show that cable and broadband net service suppliers have had their best three months ever .
more than two million americans bought broadband in the three months to october according to leichtman research .
but analysts warned that the level of growth was unlikely to continue as there was little room left to cut prices and so tempt more customers .
growth curve cable firms signed up the largest share of the two million new subscribers , with 61 % preferring to get their broadband via this route .
part of the growth has been because regional us telephone firms have been running promotions that offer dsl at very low prices .
cable firms responded to these promotions by cutting their own prices and boosting line speeds .
bruce leichtman said most of the growth came from people signing up for the cut price broadband deals .
" without these promotions , this level of growth may prove to be difficult to maintain , " he said .
but despite the growth , most us net users are still dialling up to the net with a modem .
recent growth means that broadband users in the us are hovering just under 40 % of all net users .
but the us is not the only country enjoying a broadband boom .
it is also taking off in china .
according to research by ccid consulting of beijing , the numbers of chinese net users with broadband connections has tripled in just 12 months .
in november 2002 ccid estimates that there were 3.4m chinese broadband users .
by november of this year the figure had climbed to 9.4m.
but despite this rapid increase there is still less than one broadband user for every 1000 chinese people .

the number of drivers caught was more than halved compared with last year , official figures have revealed .
police were out in force with extra traffic controls on key roads including the m4 , following considerable problems with excessive speeding at the 2002 event .
last year , 1,616 offences were recorded as rally drivers and fans made their way between different stages of the race .
seventeen drivers were punished by neath magistrates earlier this week , receiving penalty points and fines for the offences in 2002 .
but figures from the safety camera partnership , who monitored roads around the rally stages , showed that the numbers of offences fell from 1,616 to 725 this year .
the number of vehicles recorded travelling more than 20mph above the speed limit also decreased dramatically , from 121 in 2002 to 25 in 2003 . "
the support from many of this year 's competitors has had a positive effect on reducing speeds driven by supporters " john rowling , safety camera partnership john rowling , safety camera partnership project manager , said his team did not witness any of the excessive speeds recorded during the 2002 rally .
" we believe that this year 's success is down to a partnership approach involving the rally organisers , competitors and manufacturers .
" the support from many of this year 's competitors in asking motorists to stick to speed limits between stages has also had a positive effect on reducing speeds driven by supporters .
there have been concerns that the sport 's ruling body , the fédération internationale de l 'automobile -lrb- fia -rrb- , was looking into whether the roads in south wales could cope with the amount of rally traffic .
it was feared that the rally , which is worth £ 15m a year to the welsh economy , could be moved .
but on thursday , organisers moved to quell the fears , saying there was " no question " of it leaving the area .

the number of drivers caught was more than halved compared with last year , official figures have revealed .
police were out in force with extra traffic controls on key roads including the m4 , following considerable problems with excessive speeding at the 2002 event .
last year , 1,616 offences were recorded as rally drivers and fans made their way between different stages of the race .
seventeen drivers were punished by neath magistrates earlier this week , receiving penalty points and fines for the offences in 2002 .
but figures from the safety camera partnership , who monitored roads around the rally stages , showed that the numbers of offences fell from 1,616 to 725 this year .
the number of vehicles recorded travelling more than 20mph above the speed limit also decreased dramatically , from 121 in 2002 to 25 in 2003 .
the support from many of this year 's competitors has had a positive effect on reducing speeds driven by supporters john rowling , safety camera partnership john rowling , safety camera partnership project manager , said his team did not witness any of the excessive speeds recorded during the 2002 rally .
" we believe that this year 's success is down to a partnership approach involving the rally organisers , competitors and manufacturers .
" the support from many of this year 's competitors in asking motorists to stick to speed limits between stages has also had a positive effect on reducing speeds driven by supporters .
there have been concerns that the sport 's ruling body , the fédération internationale de l 'automobile -lrb- fia -rrb- , was looking into whether the roads in south wales could cope with the amount of rally traffic .
it was feared that the rally , which is worth £ 15m a year to the welsh economy , could be moved .
but on thursday , organisers moved to quell the fears , saying there was " no question " of it leaving the area .
