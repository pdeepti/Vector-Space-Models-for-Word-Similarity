u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld only managed to further exacerbate the dilemma when he spoke of an " old " and " new " europe , separating the continent into the proponents and opponents of the war . leading european intellectuals , spear-headed by german philosopher and social theorist jürgen habermas and his french colleague jacques derrida , joined the bandwagon on saturday , intimating their thoughts about european identity and the need for a common european foreign policy in newspapers across the continent . habermas and derrida have brought together some of europe 's most distinguished thinkers in an initiative that ensures europe 's intellectuals take part in designing europe 's future .
italian philosopher and novelist umberto eco , swiss author and president of the german academy of arts adolf muschg , spanish philosopher fernando savater and italian philosopher gianni vattimo have laid out their ideas on the issues .
american philosopher richard rorty has also provided his two cents in a response to habermas ' article in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . in an essay written by habermas , co-signed by derrida and published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper on saturday , the two philosophers called on the " avant-garde " core of european states to return to european enlightenment values . habermas and derrida said their essay was a response to the " letter of eight , " in which eight european countries , led by great britain and spain , published an open declaration supporting the u.s. stance on iraq in late january .

separatism , however , had to be avoided .
" the avant-garde core europe can not consolidate into a miniature europe but , as so often , must be the locomotive .

influential german philosopher jürgen habermas called for european renewal in an essay published in germany and france over the weekend , and numerous other prominent european thinkers followed suit . ever since the bitterness surrounding the u.s.-led war in iraq manifested itself , europe has been plagued with an identity crisis .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld only managed to further exacerbate the dilemma when he spoke of an " old " and " new " europe , separating the continent into the proponents and opponents of the war . leading european intellectuals , spear-headed by german philosopher and social theorist jürgen habermas and his french colleague jacques derrida , joined the bandwagon on saturday , intimating their thoughts about european identity and the need for a common european foreign policy in newspapers across the continent . habermas and derrida have brought together some of europe 's most distinguished thinkers in an initiative that ensures europe 's intellectuals take part in designing europe 's future .
italian philosopher and novelist umberto eco , swiss author and president of the german academy of arts adolf muschg , spanish philosopher fernando savater and italian philosopher gianni vattimo have laid out their ideas on the issues .
american philosopher richard rorty has also provided his two cents in a response to habermas ' article in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . in an essay written by habermas , co-signed by derrida and published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper on saturday , the two philosophers called on the " avant-garde " core of european states to return to european enlightenment values . habermas and derrida said their essay was a response to the " letter of eight , " in which eight european countries , led by great britain and spain , published an open declaration supporting the u.s. stance on iraq in late january . " we should not forget two dates , " habermas wrote , " not the day on which the newspapers communicated to their dumbfounded readers the oath of loyalty to bush that the spanish prime minister had extended to the pro-war european governments behind the backs of their eu colleagues ; but just as little so february 15 , 2003 , when the demonstrating masses in london and rome , madrid and barcelona , berlin and paris reacted to this coup . "
habermas said that the european demonstrations against a war in iraq would go down in history as a " signal for the birth of a european public . " european is … habermas identified five attributes he said europeans share : the neutrality of authority , embodied in the separation of church and state , trust in politics rather than the capitalist market , an ethos of solidarity in the fight for social justice , high esteem for international law and the rights of the individual and support for the organizational and leading role of the state . germany 's thinker de rigueur wrote that europe 's core states could put an end to europe 's stagnancy , sooner or later drawing in the remaining states which would be unable to resist .
separatism , however , had to be avoided .
" the avant-garde core europe can not consolidate into a miniature europe but , as so often , must be the locomotive . " habermas intends to continue the debate , the faz wrote , by provoking other prominent thinkers to take part in the pages of europe 's newspapers . germany 's intellectual spokesman the 73-year-old habermas is one of germany 's most significant and influential contemporary philosophers .
he is a leading representative of the " frankfurt school " that developed at the institute for social research founded in frankfurt , germany , in 1923 .
it introduced a style of analysis known as critical theory , which draws on the ideas of german political philosopher karl marx in its studies of the sources of domination and authority in society that restrict human freedom .
habermas ' works have been translated into over 20 languages and figure among the classics of contemporary philosophy . in an essay he published in the faz in mid-april , habermas condemned the war in iraq , saying it violated international law . translations by nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq threatens to overshadow eu expansion summit eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .

she told the constitutional court she saw no discrepancy between her religious beliefs and her ability to vouch for democratic values .
the german state of baden-württemberg had refused to employ ludin for a probationary period because she declined to teach without a headscarf .
baden-württemberg officials said the headscarf violated the state 's strict neutrality in religious questions .
ludin based her arguments on germany 's basic law , which guarantees the right to practice one 's religion undisturbed and ensures unlimited access to public offices regardless of one 's religious beliefs .

it could take months or even years until a court in the city decides whether the turkish citizen could be extradited , a spokeswoman for the court said .
the so-called " caliph of cologne " is wanted in turkey for planning an attack on government officials , but germany will only send him back if the court can confirm he will not be tortured there .

world leaders appeared unanimous at the conclusion of the g8 summit in evian as they buried the transatlantic rift over iraq , and vowed to strengthen cooperation in the fight against global terrorism . leaders of the world ’ s eight leading industrialized nations put up a harmonious front and reconciled bitter divisions as the three-day g8 summit in the french alpine town of evian drew to a close on tuesday .
u.s. president bush and french president chirac , arch diplomatic adversaries during the iraq war , held their first private meeting since the conflict and indicated that they were willing to bury differences .
" we can have disagreements but that does n't mean we have to be disagreeable to each other , " bush said adding , " we must now look ahead . "
chirac reciprocated by saying the g8 unanimously supported bush 's efforts to achieve israeli-palestinian peace .
the french president also said he was willing to act on a request by president bush and send special french troops to afghanistan .
news agency afp also reported that the two leaders were planning a meeting next year .
commenting on the state of relations between the two countries , chirac ’ s spokeswoman catherina colonna told reporters , " we ’ re focusing on the future .
our relations shouldn ’ t be a hostage of the past . "
though president bush didn ’ t have a face-to-face talk with german chancellor schröder , another war opponent whose relations to washington have soured in recent months , the two had a brief , spontaneous chat on the summit ’ s sidelines .
schröder aide mützelburg told reporters the first postwar iraq summit was of " great importance . "
fight against terrorism a focus in keeping with the reconciliatory tone of the summit , leaders struck a unanimous chord on a host of issues ranging from the world economy , the fight against terrorism , the curbing of weapons of mass destruction , improving humanitarian aid and fighting aids and sars .
questions of international security played a dominant role during the summit , heightened by the recent terrorist attacks in saudi arabia and morocco .
the g8 – the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy , canada , russia , - agreed on creating its own counter-terrorism action group which would help interested countries provide specialist training to police as well as help legal authorities combat terrorism and boost their security arrangements .
" for the peace and security of the world , it is essential for all countries , including developing countries , to enhance such capabilities , " a statement issued at the summit read .
curbing weapons of mass destruction g8 leaders also fell in line with washington ’ s priorities as they issued a joint pledge to counter the spread of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons and prevent them from getting into the hands of terrorists .
they said proliferation of such arms was " the pre-eminent threat to international security . "
leaders reaffirmed tighter controls to ensure that knowledge on weapons technology was not transferred irresponsibly .
since last year ’ s g8 summit in canada , " events in the world have underscored the relevance of those principles and the urgency of implementing them , " the statement said .
the group also singled out north korea and iran for criticism over their nuclear programs .
" we strongly urge north korea to visibly , verifiably and irreversibly dismantle any nuclear weapons programs , " the declaration read and added that iran ’ s nuclear program could also lead to the production of illegal weapons .
the g8 leaders also urged a clampdown on small , shoulder-held anti-aircraft missiles or " manpads " of the kind that nearly shot down an israeli airliner in kenya last november and agreed on introducing biometrics technology to decrease the number of fraudulent passports .
hopes for economic recovery leaders drew a bright face on the sluggish world economy and the fall of the dollar and said they were hopeful of prospects for an economic recovery .
summit host france announced that the leaders had agreed that currency stability was an important element for growth and they would monitor market developments closely .
however , not much progress was achieved on stalled world trade talks .
british prime minister tony blair said the g8 members shared optimism that their anemic economies would recover soon if they stuck to painful but necessary pensions and welfare reforms .
" there 's acceptance within the euro zone and within europe that provided we do face up to and overcome these challenges of structural reform , we 've got every prospect of resuming strong growth in the near future , " he told a news conference .
a step further for the fight against aids the fight against aids , which is believed to afflict about 42 million people around the world particularly in africa , was also a significant topic at the summit .
the u.s. stepped up pressure on the eu to contribute more money for the aids battle and match its own share of a billion dollars annually .
french president chirac hailed the u.s. initiative as " historic " and announced that france would triple its aids money from $ 50 million to $ 150 million .
he said he was confident the eu would in the future also be prepared to shell out a billion dollars for the fight against aids .
in the past year , the eu ’ s aids contribution amounted to € 137 million . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

world leaders appeared unanimous at the conclusion of the g8 summit in evian as they buried the transatlantic rift over iraq , and vowed to strengthen cooperation in the fight against global terrorism . leaders of the world ’ s eight leading industrialized nations put up a harmonious front and reconciled bitter divisions as the three-day g8 summit in the french alpine town of evian drew to a close on tuesday .
u.s. president bush and french president chirac , arch diplomatic adversaries during the iraq war , held their first private meeting since the conflict and indicated that they were willing to bury differences .
" we can have disagreements but that does n't mean we have to be disagreeable to each other , " bush said adding , " we must now look ahead . "
chirac reciprocated by saying the g8 unanimously supported bush 's efforts to achieve israeli-palestinian peace .
the french president also said he was willing to act on a request by president bush and send special french troops to afghanistan .
news agency afp also reported that the two leaders were planning a meeting next year .
commenting on the state of relations between the two countries , chirac ’ s spokeswoman catherina colonna told reporters , " we ’ re focusing on the future .
our relations shouldn ’ t be a hostage of the past . "
though president bush didn ’ t have a face-to-face talk with german chancellor schröder , another war opponent whose relations to washington have soured in recent months , the two had a brief , spontaneous chat on the summit ’ s sidelines .
schröder aide mützelburg told reporters the first postwar iraq summit was of " great importance . "
fight against terrorism a focus in keeping with the reconciliatory tone of the summit , leaders struck a unanimous chord on a host of issues ranging from the world economy , the fight against terrorism , the curbing of weapons of mass destruction , improving humanitarian aid and fighting aids and sars .
questions of international security played a dominant role during the summit , heightened by the recent terrorist attacks in saudi arabia and morocco .
the g8 – the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy , canada , russia , - agreed on creating its own counter-terrorism action group which would help interested countries provide specialist training to police as well as help legal authorities combat terrorism and boost their security arrangements .
" for the peace and security of the world , it is essential for all countries , including developing countries , to enhance such capabilities , " a statement issued at the summit read .
curbing weapons of mass destruction g8 leaders also fell in line with washington ’ s priorities as they issued a joint pledge to counter the spread of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons and prevent them from getting into the hands of terrorists .
they said proliferation of such arms was " the pre-eminent threat to international security . "
leaders reaffirmed tighter controls to ensure that knowledge on weapons technology was not transferred irresponsibly .
since last year ’ s g8 summit in canada , " events in the world have underscored the relevance of those principles and the urgency of implementing them , " the statement said .
the group also singled out north korea and iran for criticism over their nuclear programs .

influential german philosopher jürgen habermas called for european renewal in an essay published in germany and france over the weekend , and numerous other prominent european thinkers followed suit . ever since the bitterness surrounding the u.s.-led war in iraq manifested itself , europe has been plagued with an identity crisis .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld only managed to further exacerbate the dilemma when he spoke of an " old " and " new " europe , separating the continent into the proponents and opponents of the war . leading european intellectuals , spear-headed by german philosopher and social theorist jürgen habermas and his french colleague jacques derrida , joined the bandwagon on saturday , intimating their thoughts about european identity and the need for a common european foreign policy in newspapers across the continent . habermas and derrida have brought together some of europe 's most distinguished thinkers in an initiative that ensures europe 's intellectuals take part in designing europe 's future .
italian philosopher and novelist umberto eco , swiss author and president of the german academy of arts adolf muschg , spanish philosopher fernando savater and italian philosopher gianni vattimo have laid out their ideas on the issues .
american philosopher richard rorty has also provided his two cents in a response to habermas ' article in the süddeutsche zeitung newspaper . in an essay written by habermas , co-signed by derrida and published in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung -lrb- faz -rrb- newspaper on saturday , the two philosophers called on the " avant-garde " core of european states to return to european enlightenment values . habermas and derrida said their essay was a response to the " letter of eight , " in which eight european countries , led by great britain and spain , published an open declaration supporting the u.s. stance on iraq in late january . " we should not forget two dates , " habermas wrote , " not the day on which the newspapers communicated to their dumbfounded readers the oath of loyalty to bush that the spanish prime minister had extended to the pro-war european governments behind the backs of their eu colleagues ; but just as little so february 15 , 2003 , when the demonstrating masses in london and rome , madrid and barcelona , berlin and paris reacted to this coup . "
habermas said that the european demonstrations against a war in iraq would go down in history as a " signal for the birth of a european public . " european is … habermas identified five attributes he said europeans share : the neutrality of authority , embodied in the separation of church and state , trust in politics rather than the capitalist market , an ethos of solidarity in the fight for social justice , high esteem for international law and the rights of the individual and support for the organizational and leading role of the state . germany 's thinker de rigueur wrote that europe 's core states could put an end to europe 's stagnancy , sooner or later drawing in the remaining states which would be unable to resist .
separatism , however , had to be avoided .
" the avant-garde core europe can not consolidate into a miniature europe but , as so often , must be the locomotive .

world leaders appeared unanimous at the conclusion of the g8 summit in evian as they buried the transatlantic rift over iraq , and vowed to strengthen cooperation in the fight against global terrorism . leaders of the world ’ s eight leading industrialized nations put up a harmonious front and reconciled bitter divisions as the three-day g8 summit in the french alpine town of evian drew to a close on tuesday .
u.s. president bush and french president chirac , arch diplomatic adversaries during the iraq war , held their first private meeting since the conflict and indicated that they were willing to bury differences .
" we can have disagreements but that does n't mean we have to be disagreeable to each other , " bush said adding , " we must now look ahead . "
chirac reciprocated by saying the g8 unanimously supported bush 's efforts to achieve israeli-palestinian peace .
the french president also said he was willing to act on a request by president bush and send special french troops to afghanistan .
news agency afp also reported that the two leaders were planning a meeting next year .
commenting on the state of relations between the two countries , chirac ’ s spokeswoman catherina colonna told reporters , " we ’ re focusing on the future .
our relations shouldn ’ t be a hostage of the past . "
though president bush didn ’ t have a face-to-face talk with german chancellor schröder , another war opponent whose relations to washington have soured in recent months , the two had a brief , spontaneous chat on the summit ’ s sidelines .
schröder aide mützelburg told reporters the first postwar iraq summit was of " great importance . "
fight against terrorism a focus in keeping with the reconciliatory tone of the summit , leaders struck a unanimous chord on a host of issues ranging from the world economy , the fight against terrorism , the curbing of weapons of mass destruction , improving humanitarian aid and fighting aids and sars .
questions of international security played a dominant role during the summit , heightened by the recent terrorist attacks in saudi arabia and morocco .
the g8 – the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy , canada , russia , - agreed on creating its own counter-terrorism action group which would help interested countries provide specialist training to police as well as help legal authorities combat terrorism and boost their security arrangements .
" for the peace and security of the world , it is essential for all countries , including developing countries , to enhance such capabilities , " a statement issued at the summit read .
curbing weapons of mass destruction g8 leaders also fell in line with washington ’ s priorities as they issued a joint pledge to counter the spread of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons and prevent them from getting into the hands of terrorists .
they said proliferation of such arms was " the pre-eminent threat to international security . "
leaders reaffirmed tighter controls to ensure that knowledge on weapons technology was not transferred irresponsibly .
since last year ’ s g8 summit in canada , " events in the world have underscored the relevance of those principles and the urgency of implementing them , " the statement said .
the group also singled out north korea and iran for criticism over their nuclear programs .
" we strongly urge north korea to visibly , verifiably and irreversibly dismantle any nuclear weapons programs , " the declaration read and added that iran ’ s nuclear program could also lead to the production of illegal weapons .
the g8 leaders also urged a clampdown on small , shoulder-held anti-aircraft missiles or " manpads " of the kind that nearly shot down an israeli airliner in kenya last november and agreed on introducing biometrics technology to decrease the number of fraudulent passports .
hopes for economic recovery leaders drew a bright face on the sluggish world economy and the fall of the dollar and said they were hopeful of prospects for an economic recovery .
summit host france announced that the leaders had agreed that currency stability was an important element for growth and they would monitor market developments closely .
however , not much progress was achieved on stalled world trade talks .
british prime minister tony blair said the g8 members shared optimism that their anemic economies would recover soon if they stuck to painful but necessary pensions and welfare reforms .
" there 's acceptance within the euro zone and within europe that provided we do face up to and overcome these challenges of structural reform , we 've got every prospect of resuming strong growth in the near future , " he told a news conference .
a step further for the fight against aids the fight against aids , which is believed to afflict about 42 million people around the world particularly in africa , was also a significant topic at the summit .
the u.s. stepped up pressure on the eu to contribute more money for the aids battle and match its own share of a billion dollars annually .
french president chirac hailed the u.s. initiative as " historic " and announced that france would triple its aids money from $ 50 million to $ 150 million .
he said he was confident the eu would in the future also be prepared to shell out a billion dollars for the fight against aids .
in the past year , the eu ’ s aids contribution amounted to € 137 million . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the g8 – the united states , japan , germany , britain , france , italy , canada , russia , - agreed on creating its own counter-terrorism action group which would help interested countries provide specialist training to police as well as help legal authorities combat terrorism and boost their security arrangements .
" for the peace and security of the world , it is essential for all countries , including developing countries , to enhance such capabilities , " a statement issued at the summit read .
curbing weapons of mass destruction g8 leaders also fell in line with washington ’ s priorities as they issued a joint pledge to counter the spread of nuclear , chemical and biological weapons and prevent them from getting into the hands of terrorists .
they said proliferation of such arms was " the pre-eminent threat to international security . "
leaders reaffirmed tighter controls to ensure that knowledge on weapons technology was not transferred irresponsibly .
since last year ’ s g8 summit in canada , " events in the world have underscored the relevance of those principles and the urgency of implementing them , " the statement said .
the group also singled out north korea and iran for criticism over their nuclear programs .
" we strongly urge north korea to visibly , verifiably and irreversibly dismantle any nuclear weapons programs , " the declaration read and added that iran ’ s nuclear program could also lead to the production of illegal weapons .
the g8 leaders also urged a clampdown on small , shoulder-held anti-aircraft missiles or " manpads " of the kind that nearly shot down an israeli airliner in kenya last november and agreed on introducing biometrics technology to decrease the number of fraudulent passports .
hopes for economic recovery leaders drew a bright face on the sluggish world economy and the fall of the dollar and said they were hopeful of prospects for an economic recovery .
summit host france announced that the leaders had agreed that currency stability was an important element for growth and they would monitor market developments closely .
however , not much progress was achieved on stalled world trade talks .
british prime minister tony blair said the g8 members shared optimism that their anemic economies would recover soon if they stuck to painful but necessary pensions and welfare reforms .
" there 's acceptance within the euro zone and within europe that provided we do face up to and overcome these challenges of structural reform , we 've got every prospect of resuming strong growth in the near future , " he told a news conference .
a step further for the fight against aids the fight against aids , which is believed to afflict about 42 million people around the world particularly in africa , was also a significant topic at the summit .
the u.s. stepped up pressure on the eu to contribute more money for the aids battle and match its own share of a billion dollars annually .
french president chirac hailed the u.s. initiative as " historic " and announced that france would triple its aids money from $ 50 million to $ 150 million .
he said he was confident the eu would in the future also be prepared to shell out a billion dollars for the fight against aids .
in the past year , the eu ’ s aids contribution amounted to € 137 million . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

world leaders appeared unanimous at the conclusion of the g8 summit in evian as they buried the transatlantic rift over iraq , and vowed to strengthen cooperation in the fight against global terrorism . leaders of the world ’ s eight leading industrialized nations put up a harmonious front and reconciled bitter divisions as the three-day g8 summit in the french alpine town of evian drew to a close on tuesday .
u.s. president bush and french president chirac , arch diplomatic adversaries during the iraq war , held their first private meeting since the conflict and indicated that they were willing to bury differences .
" we can have disagreements but that does n't mean we have to be disagreeable to each other , " bush said adding , " we must now look ahead . "
chirac reciprocated by saying the g8 unanimously supported bush 's efforts to achieve israeli-palestinian peace .
the french president also said he was willing to act on a request by president bush and send special french troops to afghanistan .
news agency afp also reported that the two leaders were planning a meeting next year .
commenting on the state of relations between the two countries , chirac ’ s spokeswoman catherina colonna told reporters , " we ’ re focusing on the future .
our relations shouldn ’ t be a hostage of the past . "
though president bush didn ’ t have a face-to-face talk with german chancellor schröder , another war opponent whose relations to washington have soured in recent months , the two had a brief , spontaneous chat on the summit ’ s sidelines .
schröder aide mützelburg told reporters the first postwar iraq summit was of " great importance . "

influential german philosopher jürgen habermas called for european renewal in an essay published in germany and france over the weekend , and numerous other prominent european thinkers followed suit . ever since the bitterness surrounding the u.s.-led war in iraq manifested itself , europe has been plagued with an identity crisis .
u.s. defense secretary donald rumsfeld only managed to further exacerbate the dilemma when he spoke of an " old " and " new " europe , separating the continent into the proponents and opponents of the war . leading european intellectuals , spear-headed by german philosopher and social theorist jürgen habermas and his french colleague jacques derrida , joined the bandwagon on saturday , intimating their thoughts about european identity and the need for a common european foreign policy in newspapers across the continent . habermas and derrida have brought together some of europe 's most distinguished thinkers in an initiative that ensures europe 's intellectuals take part in designing europe 's future .
italian philosopher and novelist umberto eco , swiss author and president of the german academy of arts adolf muschg , spanish philosopher fernando savater and italian philosopher gianni vattimo have laid out their ideas on the issues .

separatism , however , had to be avoided .
" the avant-garde core europe can not consolidate into a miniature europe but , as so often , must be the locomotive .

he is a leading representative of the " frankfurt school " that developed at the institute for social research founded in frankfurt , germany , in 1923 .
it introduced a style of analysis known as critical theory , which draws on the ideas of german political philosopher karl marx in its studies of the sources of domination and authority in society that restrict human freedom .

habermas said that the european demonstrations against a war in iraq would go down in history as a " signal for the birth of a european public . " european is … habermas identified five attributes he said europeans share : the neutrality of authority , embodied in the separation of church and state , trust in politics rather than the capitalist market , an ethos of solidarity in the fight for social justice , high esteem for international law and the rights of the individual and support for the organizational and leading role of the state . germany 's thinker de rigueur wrote that europe 's core states could put an end to europe 's stagnancy , sooner or later drawing in the remaining states which would be unable to resist .
separatism , however , had to be avoided .
" the avant-garde core europe can not consolidate into a miniature europe but , as so often , must be the locomotive . " habermas intends to continue the debate , the faz wrote , by provoking other prominent thinkers to take part in the pages of europe 's newspapers . germany 's intellectual spokesman the 73-year-old habermas is one of germany 's most significant and influential contemporary philosophers .
he is a leading representative of the " frankfurt school " that developed at the institute for social research founded in frankfurt , germany , in 1923 .
it introduced a style of analysis known as critical theory , which draws on the ideas of german political philosopher karl marx in its studies of the sources of domination and authority in society that restrict human freedom .
habermas ' works have been translated into over 20 languages and figure among the classics of contemporary philosophy . in an essay he published in the faz in mid-april , habermas condemned the war in iraq , saying it violated international law . translations by nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iraq threatens to overshadow eu expansion summit eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .

the tale of soft and microsoft is the tale of david and goliath .
uk-based hermann chinnery-hesse was on holiday in his home country of ghana when he accepted a school friend 's bet to try to make his fortune in west africa .
hermann hesse : africa 's bill gates ?
starting with a battered old personal computer in his bedroom , mr hesse developed ghana 's own software firm which , for the moment at least , is holding microsoft at bay .
" no , no , we only use soft , " says the hotel receptionist where i am staying , when i ask if they use microsoft .
the shops around accra say the same .
" we 're taking it industry by industry , " mr hesse says , who has already designed e-susu software for microfinance projects and the ndua system for ghana 's timber industry .
then , of course , there are the plans to expand into wider africa , with business partnerships already set up in nigeria , the gambia , senegal and kenya .
' tropically tolerant ' there needs to be software that takes account of africa 's unique circumstances , mr hesse explains .
" first of all it needs to be simple and cheap .
then it must be tropically tolerant and able to cope with frequent power cuts . "
shops in accra use soft not microsoft " and , most importantly , it needs to be extra secure with no room whatsoever for fiddling the books , " he stresses .
mr hesse 's company now has a staff of 70 , including 20 developers , and he is just about to sell 40 % of his business to international investors .
money magnet and that foreign investment - thought to be the first agreed by any technology firm in west africa - is what makes mr hesse happiest and , presumably , richest .
" soft has no collateral , " he says , " no factory to take over if everything goes pear-shaped . "
soft 's developers originally had to share one pc " these people are choosing to invest purely because of african intellectual property and that makes me very , very proud . "
" technology is the only way for africa to get rich , " mr hesse says , " we do n't have a proper infrastructure and we ca n't compete in manufacturing ... "
" but if you put me behind a pc and tell me to write software for a chinese customer , then i can compete brain for brain with anyone trying to do the same thing in the us . "
microsoft agents and soft 's exuberant founder denies being worried by microsoft 's small presence in ghana .
a far cry from microsoft 's hq " for the moment microsoft 's software is too expensive , too complex , " he replies .
he also points out that soft can provide on-the-ground support for its software applications , should anything go wrong .
in the long term , however , mr hesse admits that his firm will probably capitulate to microsoft .
" ghana is not rich enough yet , " he says , " when we 're rich microsoft will come and do whatever they want . "
" but we 're still not afraid , " he adds quickly , " we 'll be the microsoft agents in ghana , we 've got the local knowledge . "
that pattern has already started to emerge .
last chance ?
infosys , india 's largest software firm , is just about to enter the ghanaian market and it is using soft for marketing and support .
mr hesse , in any case , says he is most likely to have retired by the time microsoft makes a concerted effort to corner his marketplace .
nevertheless , while his bet has undeniably been won , mr hesse is still passionate about the need for africa to concentrate wholeheartedly on developing its fledgling technology businesses .
" this is the first opportunity we 've had to compete for a long time , " he says , adding that the efforts of the government and the aid agencies should be to establish high-speed communication links rather than bailing out the old economy .
" we missed the first boat when industrialisation passed us by . we ca n't miss this boat , otherwise africa will have missed the boat altogether , " he warns .

click here to see yvonne 's report from the west country there , locals are concerned that the pollen from gm crops will contaminate those of nearby normal and organic crops - and gradually enter the food chain .
there is also concern that traditional farming methods will be lost .
and many people feel that the introduction of gm methods , which they say , involve the use of chemicals will kill off much wildlife and reduce the diversity of flora and fauna .
at 0810 this morning , professor malcolm grant , chair of the steering board which is organising the debates on gm food , was live on breakfast he said that publicity for the debates would be stepped up from today and that the aim is to get as many of the public involved as possible .
but he warned , " it 's not a referendum " .
professor grant did say though that government had given him a " solemn assurance , in writing " that the views of the public would be taken into account , when the final decision on gm crops is being made .
click here to see the interview with professor malcolm grant yesterday a group of organisations , including the consumers association and the national trust wrote to the government to raise concerns over the way the national debate is being run .
they are concerned that the results of the latest trials on gm foods will not be made available until the debates are over .
the public will want to know what the evidence is before they take a view sheila mckechnie , consumers ' association the results of the three year field trials are not published until september - but the debating period is due to end at the end of july .
the government says it will take a very close look at the results of the national debate , before it takes a decision on whether britain should produce gm foods .

click here to see yvonne 's ndege 's report from the us .
the view from america is that gm crops not only enable farmers to be more productive , but that they also help to protect the environment , as farmers are able to use fewer chemicals to produce their crops .

and one in four of these puts in more than 50 hours a week .
research by the john grooms charity also shows that wales has the highest proportion of the long-term sick in britain .

sam younger , chairman of the electoral commission , said the european single currency issue was so important that voting had to held at a different time to other ballots .
the commission also called for more people to be able to vote by post in a report out on tuesday .
low turnout in recent elections has worried many people , and it fell to 38 % at last month 's assembly poll .
the commission said postal ballots had significantly increased turnout during trials .
you 'd have the confusion ... of two people appearing on a platform ... against each other in one set of elections and with each other on a referendum issue sam younger , electoral commission mr younger emphasised the commission 's warning against holding a euro referendum on the same day as an election .
reports had suggested the euro poll was going to be held on the same day as the recent 1 may elections for the assembly , the scottish parliament and local authorities .
an issue of such " major constitutional significance " should be treated separately , said mr younger .
combining the two would create confusion , according to mr younger .
" you 'd have the confusion for the electorate of two people appearing on a platform on the same day against each other in one set of elections and with each other on a referendum issue , " he said .
politicians are worried by a general fall in turnout at elections " we would n't like the idea of a major referendum being held at the same time as party-based elections . "
in calling for greater use of postal ballots , mr younger said people should still be able to vote at traditional polling stations .
but mr younger said : " i think certainly postal voting will be extended . "
he told political website epolitix : " the electorate has appreciated having all-postal ballots , i think in particular getting their ballot paper through the post and being able to return it and not having specifically to apply for a postal vote .
dominant " so i think it is very much the trend that we 'll move in that direction , and it will certainly be , i think , one of the dominant ways of voting over the coming years .
" that is why we need to make sure that the legal underpinning and the security measures are right to make sure it can be done with confidence . "
mr younger admitted more needed to be done to end " confusion " in scottish parliament elections .
proportional representation means people have two votes in that ballot , as they do in wales .
" there are ways we 've been making progress , " he said .
" but i would n't underestimate what a tall order it is to make sure that people are well enough informed to exercise their vote coherently . "
