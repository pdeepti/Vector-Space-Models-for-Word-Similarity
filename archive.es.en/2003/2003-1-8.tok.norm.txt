but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f4 phantoms were scrambled to track the rogue glider over frankfurt .
during the two-hour flight and attack threat in frankfurt , military phantom jets shadowed the glider while city authorities ordered thousands of people to leave the main rail station , two opera houses and several skyscrapers which were mostly empty on a post-christmas season sunday afternoon .
schröder , struck and regional minister would decide it emerged on monday that chancellor gerhard schröder had been regularly kept informed of developments during the scare despite the outcome being deemed a minor security worry .
in the event of a larger threat , the chancellor would have been responsible for ordering the aircraft to be shot down .
the decision would have been made jointly with the defense minister peter struck and a senior regional politician in frankfurt , officials confirmed .
the defense minister himself offered little new information regarding the government 's stance on the " deadly force " option .
struck said in the german daily berliner morgenpost that action must be appropriate to the situation at hand .
speaking about possible responses to aerial threats , struck said , " one must balance -lrb- the response -rrb- with what happens when a plane approaches a skyscraper with terrorist aims . "
wendroth said that the security forces ' handling of the incident " had gone very well . "
he added that the liaison between german air security staff and nato officials , responsible for overall air safety in europe , had been " very smooth and close .

they also predict a big year for the new mini and the vw beetle convertible . for most of the large german carmakers at the detroit motor show , the optimism on display here is more than just show - it can be expressed in raw sales .
bmw , for example , sold more than 144,000 of its new mini coopers worldwide , including 25,000 on the american market last year - a sales record for the munich-based company .
organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw touareg over at volkswagen , board member jens neumann said the company is seeking to regain its lost ground this year with its new touareg luxury suv -lrb- photo -rrb- .
initially , two versions of touareg will be sold - one with a v6 engine starting at $ 34,900 and a second with a v8 engine and a pricetag starting at $ 40,700 .
the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .
in that regard , the introduction of the touareg is important , since the company does n't currently sell any models in this crucial american market segment .
most importantly , neumann says , the touareg will help volkswagen reach new target groups .
" the great thing is that we 're able to offer individualized cars fulfilling the most customer wishes possible while still keeping down our base costs and the prices at which we can offer them , " neumann said .
reincarnating an old favorite the wolfsburg , germany-based carmaker is also unveiling the new beetle convertible in detroit , the successor to the new beetle , introduced in 1998 .
more than 400,000 new beetles have been sold in the united states and the company is hoping for even greater success with its long-awaited convertible follow-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche cayenne stuttgart-based porsche is pursuing a similar strategy with its new cayenne suv -lrb- photo -rrb- , which it hopes will attract fans of the porsche brand who are n't looking to buy a sports car .
the powerful cayenne can motor from 0-62 miles per hour in just seven seconds and will carry a starting price tag of $ 55,000 .
volkswagen subsidiary audi is also jumping into the fray with the prototype pikes peak quattro suv , with which it intends to compete against its mother company and porsche .
the car packs in an impressive 500 horsepower engine - a souped up v8 the company says is capable of accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds .
in another significant market development , vw , mercedes and daimlerchrysler are all planning to unveil models next year that consume diesel fuel rather than normal gasoline .
last year , american carmaker ford said it was considering sales of diesel models in order to reduce gasoline consumption in the u.s. but it still appears to be a limited development , since a sparse number of diesel-fueled cars have been sold in the u.s. in recent decades and the technology remains relatively under-developed there .
however , if companies are able to succeed in developing diesel motors with modern fuel injection for the u.s. market , companies based in germany , where diesel-fueled cars are common , could have a clear competitive advantage . arthur landwehr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

during a diplomatic visit to turkey on wednesday , britain 's defense secretary seeks a secure commitment that turkey will make its military bases available to allies if war against iraq breaks out . bordering both iraq and syria , turkish military bases played a crucial role in the gulf war in the early ' 90s , and the west is hoping turkey will provide the same support if it resorts to war against saddam hussein a second time around .
but although british defense secretary geoff hoon emphasized the " common approach " the two countries took on international issues during a visit to ankara on wednesday , his turkish counterpart , vecdi gonul , remained cautious , telling reporters he still hoped for a peaceful outcome to the crisis .
" so far we have not formed any alliances , conducted any talks , or made any future plans on the issue of iraq outside the nato framework , " gonul said .
leaning toward the west ?
turkey , which is a nato member and is eager to join the european union , may soon be faced with a difficult choice .
opinion polls show that over 90 percent of turks are against military action in a country where over 99 percent of the population is muslim .
the turkish government is also less than enthusiastic about the prospect of war , fearing economic and internal turmoil .
nevertheless , turkey 's newly elected justice and development party - which has been at pains to allay suspicions about its islamist roots - has already pledged at least limited support its american and european nato allies .
this week , turkey granted the u.s. permission to inspect its ports and airbases , and on tuesday , a private television station reported turkey had decided to allow u2 spy planes to fly over turkish airspace en route to iraq .
turkey has also long provided support to british and american warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone over northern iraq , set up in 1991 after the gulf war .
a divided europe turkey 's position is made even more difficult by internal splits between eu members .
although british prime minister tony blair has urged the rest of europe to stand shoulder to shoulder with u.s. president george w. bush , germany is still unequivocal that it will take no part in a potential conflict , even under a u.n. mandate .
it 's a position that could also influence turkey 's eventual stance on the issue .
germany has a close , if slightly troubled relationship with turkey .
the immigration and subsequent assimilation of millions of turks into germany in the decades following world war ii after the government invited them to help rebuild their country has raised major problems over citizenship in germany for many years .
the other major player in the eu , france , hinted for the first time this week it would pledge its own forces in a possible conflict , with french president jacques chirac telling his troops they should be prepared for war .
but he also reiterated his warning that the " international community should only resort to war as a last resort . "
whichever way turkey jumps , ankara is not expected to make any final decision until jan .

meanwhile , both britain and the u.s are bracing for war with iraq .
the u.s has already stationed 60,000 troops in the persian gulf and sent its staff to a new battle headquarters in qatar .

but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f4 phantoms were scrambled to track the rogue glider over frankfurt .
during the two-hour flight and attack threat in frankfurt , military phantom jets shadowed the glider while city authorities ordered thousands of people to leave the main rail station , two opera houses and several skyscrapers which were mostly empty on a post-christmas season sunday afternoon .
schröder , struck and regional minister would decide it emerged on monday that chancellor gerhard schröder had been regularly kept informed of developments during the scare despite the outcome being deemed a minor security worry .
in the event of a larger threat , the chancellor would have been responsible for ordering the aircraft to be shot down .
the decision would have been made jointly with the defense minister peter struck and a senior regional politician in frankfurt , officials confirmed .
the defense minister himself offered little new information regarding the government 's stance on the " deadly force " option .
struck said in the german daily berliner morgenpost that action must be appropriate to the situation at hand .
speaking about possible responses to aerial threats , struck said , " one must balance -lrb- the response -rrb- with what happens when a plane approaches a skyscraper with terrorist aims . "
wendroth said that the security forces ' handling of the incident " had gone very well . "
he added that the liaison between german air security staff and nato officials , responsible for overall air safety in europe , had been " very smooth and close .

during a diplomatic visit to turkey on wednesday , britain 's defense secretary seeks a secure commitment that turkey will make its military bases available to allies if war against iraq breaks out . bordering both iraq and syria , turkish military bases played a crucial role in the gulf war in the early ' 90s , and the west is hoping turkey will provide the same support if it resorts to war against saddam hussein a second time around .

but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f4 phantoms were scrambled to track the rogue glider over frankfurt .
during the two-hour flight and attack threat in frankfurt , military phantom jets shadowed the glider while city authorities ordered thousands of people to leave the main rail station , two opera houses and several skyscrapers which were mostly empty on a post-christmas season sunday afternoon .
schröder , struck and regional minister would decide it emerged on monday that chancellor gerhard schröder had been regularly kept informed of developments during the scare despite the outcome being deemed a minor security worry .
in the event of a larger threat , the chancellor would have been responsible for ordering the aircraft to be shot down .
the decision would have been made jointly with the defense minister peter struck and a senior regional politician in frankfurt , officials confirmed .
the defense minister himself offered little new information regarding the government 's stance on the " deadly force " option .
struck said in the german daily berliner morgenpost that action must be appropriate to the situation at hand .
speaking about possible responses to aerial threats , struck said , " one must balance -lrb- the response -rrb- with what happens when a plane approaches a skyscraper with terrorist aims . "
wendroth said that the security forces ' handling of the incident " had gone very well . "
he added that the liaison between german air security staff and nato officials , responsible for overall air safety in europe , had been " very smooth and close .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.01.2003 german carmakers unveil suvs and beetles in detroit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from grocery store to beach , german carmakers hope to dominate the u.s. in 2003 in motor city detroit , german automakers from volkswagen to porsche are demonstrating their plans to conquer the sport utility sector .
they also predict a big year for the new mini and the vw beetle convertible . for most of the large german carmakers at the detroit motor show , the optimism on display here is more than just show - it can be expressed in raw sales .
bmw , for example , sold more than 144,000 of its new mini coopers worldwide , including 25,000 on the american market last year - a sales record for the munich-based company .
organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw touareg over at volkswagen , board member jens neumann said the company is seeking to regain its lost ground this year with its new touareg luxury suv -lrb- photo -rrb- .
initially , two versions of touareg will be sold - one with a v6 engine starting at $ 34,900 and a second with a v8 engine and a pricetag starting at $ 40,700 .
the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .
in that regard , the introduction of the touareg is important , since the company does n't currently sell any models in this crucial american market segment .
most importantly , neumann says , the touareg will help volkswagen reach new target groups .
" the great thing is that we 're able to offer individualized cars fulfilling the most customer wishes possible while still keeping down our base costs and the prices at which we can offer them , " neumann said .
reincarnating an old favorite the wolfsburg , germany-based carmaker is also unveiling the new beetle convertible in detroit , the successor to the new beetle , introduced in 1998 .
more than 400,000 new beetles have been sold in the united states and the company is hoping for even greater success with its long-awaited convertible follow-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche cayenne stuttgart-based porsche is pursuing a similar strategy with its new cayenne suv -lrb- photo -rrb- , which it hopes will attract fans of the porsche brand who are n't looking to buy a sports car .
the powerful cayenne can motor from 0-62 miles per hour in just seven seconds and will carry a starting price tag of $ 55,000 .
volkswagen subsidiary audi is also jumping into the fray with the prototype pikes peak quattro suv , with which it intends to compete against its mother company and porsche .
the car packs in an impressive 500 horsepower engine - a souped up v8 the company says is capable of accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds .
in another significant market development , vw , mercedes and daimlerchrysler are all planning to unveil models next year that consume diesel fuel rather than normal gasoline .
last year , american carmaker ford said it was considering sales of diesel models in order to reduce gasoline consumption in the u.s. but it still appears to be a limited development , since a sparse number of diesel-fueled cars have been sold in the u.s. in recent decades and the technology remains relatively under-developed there .
however , if companies are able to succeed in developing diesel motors with modern fuel injection for the u.s. market , companies based in germany , where diesel-fueled cars are common , could have a clear competitive advantage . arthur landwehr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

during a diplomatic visit to turkey on wednesday , britain 's defense secretary seeks a secure commitment that turkey will make its military bases available to allies if war against iraq breaks out . bordering both iraq and syria , turkish military bases played a crucial role in the gulf war in the early ' 90s , and the west is hoping turkey will provide the same support if it resorts to war against saddam hussein a second time around .
but although british defense secretary geoff hoon emphasized the " common approach " the two countries took on international issues during a visit to ankara on wednesday , his turkish counterpart , vecdi gonul , remained cautious , telling reporters he still hoped for a peaceful outcome to the crisis .
" so far we have not formed any alliances , conducted any talks , or made any future plans on the issue of iraq outside the nato framework , " gonul said .
leaning toward the west ?
turkey , which is a nato member and is eager to join the european union , may soon be faced with a difficult choice .
opinion polls show that over 90 percent of turks are against military action in a country where over 99 percent of the population is muslim .
the turkish government is also less than enthusiastic about the prospect of war , fearing economic and internal turmoil .
nevertheless , turkey 's newly elected justice and development party - which has been at pains to allay suspicions about its islamist roots - has already pledged at least limited support its american and european nato allies .
this week , turkey granted the u.s. permission to inspect its ports and airbases , and on tuesday , a private television station reported turkey had decided to allow u2 spy planes to fly over turkish airspace en route to iraq .
turkey has also long provided support to british and american warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone over northern iraq , set up in 1991 after the gulf war .
a divided europe turkey 's position is made even more difficult by internal splits between eu members .
although british prime minister tony blair has urged the rest of europe to stand shoulder to shoulder with u.s. president george w. bush , germany is still unequivocal that it will take no part in a potential conflict , even under a u.n. mandate .
it 's a position that could also influence turkey 's eventual stance on the issue .
germany has a close , if slightly troubled relationship with turkey .
the immigration and subsequent assimilation of millions of turks into germany in the decades following world war ii after the government invited them to help rebuild their country has raised major problems over citizenship in germany for many years .
the other major player in the eu , france , hinted for the first time this week it would pledge its own forces in a possible conflict , with french president jacques chirac telling his troops they should be prepared for war .
but he also reiterated his warning that the " international community should only resort to war as a last resort . "
whichever way turkey jumps , ankara is not expected to make any final decision until jan .
27th , when un weapons inspectors will present the first report on their findings in iraq .
meanwhile , both britain and the u.s are bracing for war with iraq .
the u.s has already stationed 60,000 troops in the persian gulf and sent its staff to a new battle headquarters in qatar .
britain has mobilized front-line troops and ships and called up 7,000 reservists .
a royal navy task force including a submarine and destroyer also set sail for the middle east last weekend . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey gets its date with the eu the eu said turkey could begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 , more than one year later than ankara had hoped for .

but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f4 phantoms were scrambled to track the rogue glider over frankfurt .
during the two-hour flight and attack threat in frankfurt , military phantom jets shadowed the glider while city authorities ordered thousands of people to leave the main rail station , two opera houses and several skyscrapers which were mostly empty on a post-christmas season sunday afternoon .
schröder , struck and regional minister would decide it emerged on monday that chancellor gerhard schröder had been regularly kept informed of developments during the scare despite the outcome being deemed a minor security worry .
in the event of a larger threat , the chancellor would have been responsible for ordering the aircraft to be shot down .
the decision would have been made jointly with the defense minister peter struck and a senior regional politician in frankfurt , officials confirmed .
the defense minister himself offered little new information regarding the government 's stance on the " deadly force " option .
struck said in the german daily berliner morgenpost that action must be appropriate to the situation at hand .
speaking about possible responses to aerial threats , struck said , " one must balance -lrb- the response -rrb- with what happens when a plane approaches a skyscraper with terrorist aims . "
wendroth said that the security forces ' handling of the incident " had gone very well . "
he added that the liaison between german air security staff and nato officials , responsible for overall air safety in europe , had been " very smooth and close .

they also predict a big year for the new mini and the vw beetle convertible . for most of the large german carmakers at the detroit motor show , the optimism on display here is more than just show - it can be expressed in raw sales .
bmw , for example , sold more than 144,000 of its new mini coopers worldwide , including 25,000 on the american market last year - a sales record for the munich-based company .
organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw touareg over at volkswagen , board member jens neumann said the company is seeking to regain its lost ground this year with its new touareg luxury suv -lrb- photo -rrb- .
initially , two versions of touareg will be sold - one with a v6 engine starting at $ 34,900 and a second with a v8 engine and a pricetag starting at $ 40,700 .
the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .
in that regard , the introduction of the touareg is important , since the company does n't currently sell any models in this crucial american market segment .
most importantly , neumann says , the touareg will help volkswagen reach new target groups .
" the great thing is that we 're able to offer individualized cars fulfilling the most customer wishes possible while still keeping down our base costs and the prices at which we can offer them , " neumann said .
reincarnating an old favorite the wolfsburg , germany-based carmaker is also unveiling the new beetle convertible in detroit , the successor to the new beetle , introduced in 1998 .
more than 400,000 new beetles have been sold in the united states and the company is hoping for even greater success with its long-awaited convertible follow-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche cayenne stuttgart-based porsche is pursuing a similar strategy with its new cayenne suv -lrb- photo -rrb- , which it hopes will attract fans of the porsche brand who are n't looking to buy a sports car .
the powerful cayenne can motor from 0-62 miles per hour in just seven seconds and will carry a starting price tag of $ 55,000 .
volkswagen subsidiary audi is also jumping into the fray with the prototype pikes peak quattro suv , with which it intends to compete against its mother company and porsche .
the car packs in an impressive 500 horsepower engine - a souped up v8 the company says is capable of accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.01.2003 german carmakers unveil suvs and beetles in detroit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from grocery store to beach , german carmakers hope to dominate the u.s. in 2003 in motor city detroit , german automakers from volkswagen to porsche are demonstrating their plans to conquer the sport utility sector .
they also predict a big year for the new mini and the vw beetle convertible . for most of the large german carmakers at the detroit motor show , the optimism on display here is more than just show - it can be expressed in raw sales .
bmw , for example , sold more than 144,000 of its new mini coopers worldwide , including 25,000 on the american market last year - a sales record for the munich-based company .
organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw touareg over at volkswagen , board member jens neumann said the company is seeking to regain its lost ground this year with its new touareg luxury suv -lrb- photo -rrb- .
initially , two versions of touareg will be sold - one with a v6 engine starting at $ 34,900 and a second with a v8 engine and a pricetag starting at $ 40,700 .
the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .
in that regard , the introduction of the touareg is important , since the company does n't currently sell any models in this crucial american market segment .
most importantly , neumann says , the touareg will help volkswagen reach new target groups .
" the great thing is that we 're able to offer individualized cars fulfilling the most customer wishes possible while still keeping down our base costs and the prices at which we can offer them , " neumann said .
reincarnating an old favorite the wolfsburg , germany-based carmaker is also unveiling the new beetle convertible in detroit , the successor to the new beetle , introduced in 1998 .
more than 400,000 new beetles have been sold in the united states and the company is hoping for even greater success with its long-awaited convertible follow-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche cayenne stuttgart-based porsche is pursuing a similar strategy with its new cayenne suv -lrb- photo -rrb- , which it hopes will attract fans of the porsche brand who are n't looking to buy a sports car .
the powerful cayenne can motor from 0-62 miles per hour in just seven seconds and will carry a starting price tag of $ 55,000 .
volkswagen subsidiary audi is also jumping into the fray with the prototype pikes peak quattro suv , with which it intends to compete against its mother company and porsche .
the car packs in an impressive 500 horsepower engine - a souped up v8 the company says is capable of accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds .
in another significant market development , vw , mercedes and daimlerchrysler are all planning to unveil models next year that consume diesel fuel rather than normal gasoline .
last year , american carmaker ford said it was considering sales of diesel models in order to reduce gasoline consumption in the u.s. but it still appears to be a limited development , since a sparse number of diesel-fueled cars have been sold in the u.s. in recent decades and the technology remains relatively under-developed there .
however , if companies are able to succeed in developing diesel motors with modern fuel injection for the u.s. market , companies based in germany , where diesel-fueled cars are common , could have a clear competitive advantage . arthur landwehr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

during a diplomatic visit to turkey on wednesday , britain 's defense secretary seeks a secure commitment that turkey will make its military bases available to allies if war against iraq breaks out . bordering both iraq and syria , turkish military bases played a crucial role in the gulf war in the early ' 90s , and the west is hoping turkey will provide the same support if it resorts to war against saddam hussein a second time around .
but although british defense secretary geoff hoon emphasized the " common approach " the two countries took on international issues during a visit to ankara on wednesday , his turkish counterpart , vecdi gonul , remained cautious , telling reporters he still hoped for a peaceful outcome to the crisis .
" so far we have not formed any alliances , conducted any talks , or made any future plans on the issue of iraq outside the nato framework , " gonul said .
leaning toward the west ?
turkey , which is a nato member and is eager to join the european union , may soon be faced with a difficult choice .
opinion polls show that over 90 percent of turks are against military action in a country where over 99 percent of the population is muslim .
the turkish government is also less than enthusiastic about the prospect of war , fearing economic and internal turmoil .
nevertheless , turkey 's newly elected justice and development party - which has been at pains to allay suspicions about its islamist roots - has already pledged at least limited support its american and european nato allies .
this week , turkey granted the u.s. permission to inspect its ports and airbases , and on tuesday , a private television station reported turkey had decided to allow u2 spy planes to fly over turkish airspace en route to iraq .
turkey has also long provided support to british and american warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone over northern iraq , set up in 1991 after the gulf war .
a divided europe turkey 's position is made even more difficult by internal splits between eu members .
although british prime minister tony blair has urged the rest of europe to stand shoulder to shoulder with u.s. president george w. bush , germany is still unequivocal that it will take no part in a potential conflict , even under a u.n. mandate .
it 's a position that could also influence turkey 's eventual stance on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.01.2003 german air security debate remains grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a closer look in the name of safety german officials prepare to tighten air security across the country in the wake of a recent frankfurt hijack .
but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f4 phantoms were scrambled to track the rogue glider over frankfurt .
during the two-hour flight and attack threat in frankfurt , military phantom jets shadowed the glider while city authorities ordered thousands of people to leave the main rail station , two opera houses and several skyscrapers which were mostly empty on a post-christmas season sunday afternoon .
schröder , struck and regional minister would decide it emerged on monday that chancellor gerhard schröder had been regularly kept informed of developments during the scare despite the outcome being deemed a minor security worry .
in the event of a larger threat , the chancellor would have been responsible for ordering the aircraft to be shot down .
the decision would have been made jointly with the defense minister peter struck and a senior regional politician in frankfurt , officials confirmed .
the defense minister himself offered little new information regarding the government 's stance on the " deadly force " option .
struck said in the german daily berliner morgenpost that action must be appropriate to the situation at hand .
speaking about possible responses to aerial threats , struck said , " one must balance -lrb- the response -rrb- with what happens when a plane approaches a skyscraper with terrorist aims . "
wendroth said that the security forces ' handling of the incident " had gone very well . "
he added that the liaison between german air security staff and nato officials , responsible for overall air safety in europe , had been " very smooth and close .

but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f4 phantoms were scrambled to track the rogue glider over frankfurt .
during the two-hour flight and attack threat in frankfurt , military phantom jets shadowed the glider while city authorities ordered thousands of people to leave the main rail station , two opera houses and several skyscrapers which were mostly empty on a post-christmas season sunday afternoon .
schröder , struck and regional minister would decide it emerged on monday that chancellor gerhard schröder had been regularly kept informed of developments during the scare despite the outcome being deemed a minor security worry .
in the event of a larger threat , the chancellor would have been responsible for ordering the aircraft to be shot down .
the decision would have been made jointly with the defense minister peter struck and a senior regional politician in frankfurt , officials confirmed .
the defense minister himself offered little new information regarding the government 's stance on the " deadly force " option .
struck said in the german daily berliner morgenpost that action must be appropriate to the situation at hand .
speaking about possible responses to aerial threats , struck said , " one must balance -lrb- the response -rrb- with what happens when a plane approaches a skyscraper with terrorist aims . "
wendroth said that the security forces ' handling of the incident " had gone very well . "
he added that the liaison between german air security staff and nato officials , responsible for overall air safety in europe , had been " very smooth and close .

they also predict a big year for the new mini and the vw beetle convertible . for most of the large german carmakers at the detroit motor show , the optimism on display here is more than just show - it can be expressed in raw sales .
bmw , for example , sold more than 144,000 of its new mini coopers worldwide , including 25,000 on the american market last year - a sales record for the munich-based company .
organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw touareg over at volkswagen , board member jens neumann said the company is seeking to regain its lost ground this year with its new touareg luxury suv -lrb- photo -rrb- .
initially , two versions of touareg will be sold - one with a v6 engine starting at $ 34,900 and a second with a v8 engine and a pricetag starting at $ 40,700 .
the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .
in that regard , the introduction of the touareg is important , since the company does n't currently sell any models in this crucial american market segment .
most importantly , neumann says , the touareg will help volkswagen reach new target groups .
" the great thing is that we 're able to offer individualized cars fulfilling the most customer wishes possible while still keeping down our base costs and the prices at which we can offer them , " neumann said .
reincarnating an old favorite the wolfsburg , germany-based carmaker is also unveiling the new beetle convertible in detroit , the successor to the new beetle , introduced in 1998 .
more than 400,000 new beetles have been sold in the united states and the company is hoping for even greater success with its long-awaited convertible follow-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche cayenne stuttgart-based porsche is pursuing a similar strategy with its new cayenne suv -lrb- photo -rrb- , which it hopes will attract fans of the porsche brand who are n't looking to buy a sports car .
the powerful cayenne can motor from 0-62 miles per hour in just seven seconds and will carry a starting price tag of $ 55,000 .
volkswagen subsidiary audi is also jumping into the fray with the prototype pikes peak quattro suv , with which it intends to compete against its mother company and porsche .
the car packs in an impressive 500 horsepower engine - a souped up v8 the company says is capable of accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds .
in another significant market development , vw , mercedes and daimlerchrysler are all planning to unveil models next year that consume diesel fuel rather than normal gasoline .
last year , american carmaker ford said it was considering sales of diesel models in order to reduce gasoline consumption in the u.s. but it still appears to be a limited development , since a sparse number of diesel-fueled cars have been sold in the u.s. in recent decades and the technology remains relatively under-developed there .
however , if companies are able to succeed in developing diesel motors with modern fuel injection for the u.s. market , companies based in germany , where diesel-fueled cars are common , could have a clear competitive advantage . arthur landwehr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw touareg over at volkswagen , board member jens neumann said the company is seeking to regain its lost ground this year with its new touareg luxury suv -lrb- photo -rrb- .
initially , two versions of touareg will be sold - one with a v6 engine starting at $ 34,900 and a second with a v8 engine and a pricetag starting at $ 40,700 .
the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .
in that regard , the introduction of the touareg is important , since the company does n't currently sell any models in this crucial american market segment .
most importantly , neumann says , the touareg will help volkswagen reach new target groups .
" the great thing is that we 're able to offer individualized cars fulfilling the most customer wishes possible while still keeping down our base costs and the prices at which we can offer them , " neumann said .
reincarnating an old favorite the wolfsburg , germany-based carmaker is also unveiling the new beetle convertible in detroit , the successor to the new beetle , introduced in 1998 .
more than 400,000 new beetles have been sold in the united states and the company is hoping for even greater success with its long-awaited convertible follow-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche cayenne stuttgart-based porsche is pursuing a similar strategy with its new cayenne suv -lrb- photo -rrb- , which it hopes will attract fans of the porsche brand who are n't looking to buy a sports car .
the powerful cayenne can motor from 0-62 miles per hour in just seven seconds and will carry a starting price tag of $ 55,000 .
volkswagen subsidiary audi is also jumping into the fray with the prototype pikes peak quattro suv , with which it intends to compete against its mother company and porsche .
the car packs in an impressive 500 horsepower engine - a souped up v8 the company says is capable of accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds .
in another significant market development , vw , mercedes and daimlerchrysler are all planning to unveil models next year that consume diesel fuel rather than normal gasoline .
last year , american carmaker ford said it was considering sales of diesel models in order to reduce gasoline consumption in the u.s. but it still appears to be a limited development , since a sparse number of diesel-fueled cars have been sold in the u.s. in recent decades and the technology remains relatively under-developed there .
however , if companies are able to succeed in developing diesel motors with modern fuel injection for the u.s. market , companies based in germany , where diesel-fueled cars are common , could have a clear competitive advantage . arthur landwehr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

during a diplomatic visit to turkey on wednesday , britain 's defense secretary seeks a secure commitment that turkey will make its military bases available to allies if war against iraq breaks out . bordering both iraq and syria , turkish military bases played a crucial role in the gulf war in the early ' 90s , and the west is hoping turkey will provide the same support if it resorts to war against saddam hussein a second time around .
but although british defense secretary geoff hoon emphasized the " common approach " the two countries took on international issues during a visit to ankara on wednesday , his turkish counterpart , vecdi gonul , remained cautious , telling reporters he still hoped for a peaceful outcome to the crisis .
" so far we have not formed any alliances , conducted any talks , or made any future plans on the issue of iraq outside the nato framework , " gonul said .

turkey , which is a nato member and is eager to join the european union , may soon be faced with a difficult choice .
opinion polls show that over 90 percent of turks are against military action in a country where over 99 percent of the population is muslim .
the turkish government is also less than enthusiastic about the prospect of war , fearing economic and internal turmoil .
nevertheless , turkey 's newly elected justice and development party - which has been at pains to allay suspicions about its islamist roots - has already pledged at least limited support its american and european nato allies .
this week , turkey granted the u.s. permission to inspect its ports and airbases , and on tuesday , a private television station reported turkey had decided to allow u2 spy planes to fly over turkish airspace en route to iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.01.2003 german air security debate remains grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a closer look in the name of safety german officials prepare to tighten air security across the country in the wake of a recent frankfurt hijack .
but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .

but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .

grundig stood for high-quality electronics , " made in germany . " then germans became interested in cheaper consumer electronics and home appliances from the far east .
and now grundig itself is going asian .
taiwanese monitor manufacturer sampo signed a deal wednesday agreeing to take on the majority share of the nuremburg-based company .
the deal saves at least some of grundig 's 1,300 jobs in germany - at least for the time being .
the sale agreement specifies that research and development is to stay at the original site in nuremburg .
a sale price was not announced . the traditional german consumer electronics manufacturer began racking up losses in the early ' 80s as cheap imports from asia began flooding the german market .
grundig has changed hands a number of times since then , but no one has been able to restore profitability to the company . more briefs 06.01.2003 -pipe- record sales for german car makers in u.s. 03.01.2003 -pipe- bmw introduces its first rolls royce 03.01.2003 -pipe- euro zone inflation still above target ceiling 03.01.2003 -pipe- bad news for german retailers 02.01.2003 -pipe- new german can deposit law goes into effect 02.01.2003 -pipe- german automakers triple sales in u.s. 02.01.2003 -pipe- a bad year for german industry 02.01.2003 -pipe- negotiations resume between union , government radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.01.2003 german carmakers unveil suvs and beetles in detroit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from grocery store to beach , german carmakers hope to dominate the u.s. in 2003 in motor city detroit , german automakers from volkswagen to porsche are demonstrating their plans to conquer the sport utility sector .
they also predict a big year for the new mini and the vw beetle convertible . for most of the large german carmakers at the detroit motor show , the optimism on display here is more than just show - it can be expressed in raw sales .
bmw , for example , sold more than 144,000 of its new mini coopers worldwide , including 25,000 on the american market last year - a sales record for the munich-based company .
organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw touareg over at volkswagen , board member jens neumann said the company is seeking to regain its lost ground this year with its new touareg luxury suv -lrb- photo -rrb- .
initially , two versions of touareg will be sold - one with a v6 engine starting at $ 34,900 and a second with a v8 engine and a pricetag starting at $ 40,700 .
the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .
in that regard , the introduction of the touareg is important , since the company does n't currently sell any models in this crucial american market segment .
most importantly , neumann says , the touareg will help volkswagen reach new target groups .
" the great thing is that we 're able to offer individualized cars fulfilling the most customer wishes possible while still keeping down our base costs and the prices at which we can offer them , " neumann said .
reincarnating an old favorite the wolfsburg , germany-based carmaker is also unveiling the new beetle convertible in detroit , the successor to the new beetle , introduced in 1998 .
more than 400,000 new beetles have been sold in the united states and the company is hoping for even greater success with its long-awaited convertible follow-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche cayenne stuttgart-based porsche is pursuing a similar strategy with its new cayenne suv -lrb- photo -rrb- , which it hopes will attract fans of the porsche brand who are n't looking to buy a sports car .
the powerful cayenne can motor from 0-62 miles per hour in just seven seconds and will carry a starting price tag of $ 55,000 .
volkswagen subsidiary audi is also jumping into the fray with the prototype pikes peak quattro suv , with which it intends to compete against its mother company and porsche .
the car packs in an impressive 500 horsepower engine - a souped up v8 the company says is capable of accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds .
in another significant market development , vw , mercedes and daimlerchrysler are all planning to unveil models next year that consume diesel fuel rather than normal gasoline .
last year , american carmaker ford said it was considering sales of diesel models in order to reduce gasoline consumption in the u.s. but it still appears to be a limited development , since a sparse number of diesel-fueled cars have been sold in the u.s. in recent decades and the technology remains relatively under-developed there .
however , if companies are able to succeed in developing diesel motors with modern fuel injection for the u.s. market , companies based in germany , where diesel-fueled cars are common , could have a clear competitive advantage . arthur landwehr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multi-media archive .

they also predict a big year for the new mini and the vw beetle convertible . for most of the large german carmakers at the detroit motor show , the optimism on display here is more than just show - it can be expressed in raw sales .
bmw , for example , sold more than 144,000 of its new mini coopers worldwide , including 25,000 on the american market last year - a sales record for the munich-based company .
organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw touareg over at volkswagen , board member jens neumann said the company is seeking to regain its lost ground this year with its new touareg luxury suv -lrb- photo -rrb- .
initially , two versions of touareg will be sold - one with a v6 engine starting at $ 34,900 and a second with a v8 engine and a pricetag starting at $ 40,700 .
the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .
in that regard , the introduction of the touareg is important , since the company does n't currently sell any models in this crucial american market segment .
most importantly , neumann says , the touareg will help volkswagen reach new target groups .
" the great thing is that we 're able to offer individualized cars fulfilling the most customer wishes possible while still keeping down our base costs and the prices at which we can offer them , " neumann said .
reincarnating an old favorite the wolfsburg , germany-based carmaker is also unveiling the new beetle convertible in detroit , the successor to the new beetle , introduced in 1998 .
more than 400,000 new beetles have been sold in the united states and the company is hoping for even greater success with its long-awaited convertible follow-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche cayenne stuttgart-based porsche is pursuing a similar strategy with its new cayenne suv -lrb- photo -rrb- , which it hopes will attract fans of the porsche brand who are n't looking to buy a sports car .
the powerful cayenne can motor from 0-62 miles per hour in just seven seconds and will carry a starting price tag of $ 55,000 .
volkswagen subsidiary audi is also jumping into the fray with the prototype pikes peak quattro suv , with which it intends to compete against its mother company and porsche .
the car packs in an impressive 500 horsepower engine - a souped up v8 the company says is capable of accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds .
in another significant market development , vw , mercedes and daimlerchrysler are all planning to unveil models next year that consume diesel fuel rather than normal gasoline .
last year , american carmaker ford said it was considering sales of diesel models in order to reduce gasoline consumption in the u.s. but it still appears to be a limited development , since a sparse number of diesel-fueled cars have been sold in the u.s. in recent decades and the technology remains relatively under-developed there .
however , if companies are able to succeed in developing diesel motors with modern fuel injection for the u.s. market , companies based in germany , where diesel-fueled cars are common , could have a clear competitive advantage . arthur landwehr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live popxport we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

during a diplomatic visit to turkey on wednesday , britain 's defense secretary seeks a secure commitment that turkey will make its military bases available to allies if war against iraq breaks out . bordering both iraq and syria , turkish military bases played a crucial role in the gulf war in the early ' 90s , and the west is hoping turkey will provide the same support if it resorts to war against saddam hussein a second time around .
but although british defense secretary geoff hoon emphasized the " common approach " the two countries took on international issues during a visit to ankara on wednesday , his turkish counterpart , vecdi gonul , remained cautious , telling reporters he still hoped for a peaceful outcome to the crisis .
" so far we have not formed any alliances , conducted any talks , or made any future plans on the issue of iraq outside the nato framework , " gonul said .
leaning toward the west ?
turkey , which is a nato member and is eager to join the european union , may soon be faced with a difficult choice .
opinion polls show that over 90 percent of turks are against military action in a country where over 99 percent of the population is muslim .
the turkish government is also less than enthusiastic about the prospect of war , fearing economic and internal turmoil .
nevertheless , turkey 's newly elected justice and development party - which has been at pains to allay suspicions about its islamist roots - has already pledged at least limited support its american and european nato allies .
this week , turkey granted the u.s. permission to inspect its ports and airbases , and on tuesday , a private television station reported turkey had decided to allow u2 spy planes to fly over turkish airspace en route to iraq .
turkey has also long provided support to british and american warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone over northern iraq , set up in 1991 after the gulf war .
a divided europe turkey 's position is made even more difficult by internal splits between eu members .
although british prime minister tony blair has urged the rest of europe to stand shoulder to shoulder with u.s. president george w. bush , germany is still unequivocal that it will take no part in a potential conflict , even under a u.n. mandate .
it 's a position that could also influence turkey 's eventual stance on the issue .
germany has a close , if slightly troubled relationship with turkey .
the immigration and subsequent assimilation of millions of turks into germany in the decades following world war ii after the government invited them to help rebuild their country has raised major problems over citizenship in germany for many years .
the other major player in the eu , france , hinted for the first time this week it would pledge its own forces in a possible conflict , with french president jacques chirac telling his troops they should be prepared for war .
but he also reiterated his warning that the " international community should only resort to war as a last resort . "
whichever way turkey jumps , ankara is not expected to make any final decision until jan .
27th , when un weapons inspectors will present the first report on their findings in iraq .
meanwhile , both britain and the u.s are bracing for war with iraq .
the u.s has already stationed 60,000 troops in the persian gulf and sent its staff to a new battle headquarters in qatar .
britain has mobilized front-line troops and ships and called up 7,000 reservists .
a royal navy task force including a submarine and destroyer also set sail for the middle east last weekend . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey gets its date with the eu the eu said turkey could begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 , more than one year later than ankara had hoped for .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.01.2003 german air security debate remains grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a closer look in the name of safety german officials prepare to tighten air security across the country in the wake of a recent frankfurt hijack .
but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f4 phantoms were scrambled to track the rogue glider over frankfurt .
during the two-hour flight and attack threat in frankfurt , military phantom jets shadowed the glider while city authorities ordered thousands of people to leave the main rail station , two opera houses and several skyscrapers which were mostly empty on a post-christmas season sunday afternoon .
schröder , struck and regional minister would decide it emerged on monday that chancellor gerhard schröder had been regularly kept informed of developments during the scare despite the outcome being deemed a minor security worry .
in the event of a larger threat , the chancellor would have been responsible for ordering the aircraft to be shot down .
the decision would have been made jointly with the defense minister peter struck and a senior regional politician in frankfurt , officials confirmed .
the defense minister himself offered little new information regarding the government 's stance on the " deadly force " option .
struck said in the german daily berliner morgenpost that action must be appropriate to the situation at hand .
speaking about possible responses to aerial threats , struck said , " one must balance -lrb- the response -rrb- with what happens when a plane approaches a skyscraper with terrorist aims . "
wendroth said that the security forces ' handling of the incident " had gone very well . "
he added that the liaison between german air security staff and nato officials , responsible for overall air safety in europe , had been " very smooth and close .

organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw touareg over at volkswagen , board member jens neumann said the company is seeking to regain its lost ground this year with its new touareg luxury suv -lrb- photo -rrb- .
initially , two versions of touareg will be sold - one with a v6 engine starting at $ 34,900 and a second with a v8 engine and a pricetag starting at $ 40,700 .
the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .
in that regard , the introduction of the touareg is important , since the company does n't currently sell any models in this crucial american market segment .
most importantly , neumann says , the touareg will help volkswagen reach new target groups .
" the great thing is that we 're able to offer individualized cars fulfilling the most customer wishes possible while still keeping down our base costs and the prices at which we can offer them , " neumann said .
reincarnating an old favorite the wolfsburg , germany-based carmaker is also unveiling the new beetle convertible in detroit , the successor to the new beetle , introduced in 1998 .
more than 400,000 new beetles have been sold in the united states and the company is hoping for even greater success with its long-awaited convertible follow-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche cayenne stuttgart-based porsche is pursuing a similar strategy with its new cayenne suv -lrb- photo -rrb- , which it hopes will attract fans of the porsche brand who are n't looking to buy a sports car .
the powerful cayenne can motor from 0-62 miles per hour in just seven seconds and will carry a starting price tag of $ 55,000 .
volkswagen subsidiary audi is also jumping into the fray with the prototype pikes peak quattro suv , with which it intends to compete against its mother company and porsche .
the car packs in an impressive 500 horsepower engine - a souped up v8 the company says is capable of accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds .
in another significant market development , vw , mercedes and daimlerchrysler are all planning to unveil models next year that consume diesel fuel rather than normal gasoline .
last year , american carmaker ford said it was considering sales of diesel models in order to reduce gasoline consumption in the u.s. but it still appears to be a limited development , since a sparse number of diesel-fueled cars have been sold in the u.s. in recent decades and the technology remains relatively under-developed there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.01.2003 german carmakers unveil suvs and beetles in detroit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from grocery store to beach , german carmakers hope to dominate the u.s. in 2003 in motor city detroit , german automakers from volkswagen to porsche are demonstrating their plans to conquer the sport utility sector .
they also predict a big year for the new mini and the vw beetle convertible . for most of the large german carmakers at the detroit motor show , the optimism on display here is more than just show - it can be expressed in raw sales .
bmw , for example , sold more than 144,000 of its new mini coopers worldwide , including 25,000 on the american market last year - a sales record for the munich-based company .
organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw touareg over at volkswagen , board member jens neumann said the company is seeking to regain its lost ground this year with its new touareg luxury suv -lrb- photo -rrb- .
initially , two versions of touareg will be sold - one with a v6 engine starting at $ 34,900 and a second with a v8 engine and a pricetag starting at $ 40,700 .
the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .
in that regard , the introduction of the touareg is important , since the company does n't currently sell any models in this crucial american market segment .
most importantly , neumann says , the touareg will help volkswagen reach new target groups .
" the great thing is that we 're able to offer individualized cars fulfilling the most customer wishes possible while still keeping down our base costs and the prices at which we can offer them , " neumann said .
reincarnating an old favorite the wolfsburg , germany-based carmaker is also unveiling the new beetle convertible in detroit , the successor to the new beetle , introduced in 1998 .
more than 400,000 new beetles have been sold in the united states and the company is hoping for even greater success with its long-awaited convertible follow-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche cayenne stuttgart-based porsche is pursuing a similar strategy with its new cayenne suv -lrb- photo -rrb- , which it hopes will attract fans of the porsche brand who are n't looking to buy a sports car .
the powerful cayenne can motor from 0-62 miles per hour in just seven seconds and will carry a starting price tag of $ 55,000 .
volkswagen subsidiary audi is also jumping into the fray with the prototype pikes peak quattro suv , with which it intends to compete against its mother company and porsche .
the car packs in an impressive 500 horsepower engine - a souped up v8 the company says is capable of accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds .
in another significant market development , vw , mercedes and daimlerchrysler are all planning to unveil models next year that consume diesel fuel rather than normal gasoline .
last year , american carmaker ford said it was considering sales of diesel models in order to reduce gasoline consumption in the u.s. but it still appears to be a limited development , since a sparse number of diesel-fueled cars have been sold in the u.s. in recent decades and the technology remains relatively under-developed there .
however , if companies are able to succeed in developing diesel motors with modern fuel injection for the u.s. market , companies based in germany , where diesel-fueled cars are common , could have a clear competitive advantage . arthur landwehr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 dw-tv europe live talking germany we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f4 phantoms were scrambled to track the rogue glider over frankfurt .
during the two-hour flight and attack threat in frankfurt , military phantom jets shadowed the glider while city authorities ordered thousands of people to leave the main rail station , two opera houses and several skyscrapers which were mostly empty on a post-christmas season sunday afternoon .
schröder , struck and regional minister would decide it emerged on monday that chancellor gerhard schröder had been regularly kept informed of developments during the scare despite the outcome being deemed a minor security worry .
in the event of a larger threat , the chancellor would have been responsible for ordering the aircraft to be shot down .
the decision would have been made jointly with the defense minister peter struck and a senior regional politician in frankfurt , officials confirmed .
the defense minister himself offered little new information regarding the government 's stance on the " deadly force " option .
struck said in the german daily berliner morgenpost that action must be appropriate to the situation at hand .
speaking about possible responses to aerial threats , struck said , " one must balance -lrb- the response -rrb- with what happens when a plane approaches a skyscraper with terrorist aims . "
wendroth said that the security forces ' handling of the incident " had gone very well . "
he added that the liaison between german air security staff and nato officials , responsible for overall air safety in europe , had been " very smooth and close .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.01.2003 british woo turkey for support in campaign against iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. wants to use turkish military bases .
during a diplomatic visit to turkey on wednesday , britain 's defense secretary seeks a secure commitment that turkey will make its military bases available to allies if war against iraq breaks out . bordering both iraq and syria , turkish military bases played a crucial role in the gulf war in the early ' 90s , and the west is hoping turkey will provide the same support if it resorts to war against saddam hussein a second time around .
but although british defense secretary geoff hoon emphasized the " common approach " the two countries took on international issues during a visit to ankara on wednesday , his turkish counterpart , vecdi gonul , remained cautious , telling reporters he still hoped for a peaceful outcome to the crisis .
" so far we have not formed any alliances , conducted any talks , or made any future plans on the issue of iraq outside the nato framework , " gonul said .
leaning toward the west ?
turkey , which is a nato member and is eager to join the european union , may soon be faced with a difficult choice .
opinion polls show that over 90 percent of turks are against military action in a country where over 99 percent of the population is muslim .
the turkish government is also less than enthusiastic about the prospect of war , fearing economic and internal turmoil .
nevertheless , turkey 's newly elected justice and development party - which has been at pains to allay suspicions about its islamist roots - has already pledged at least limited support its american and european nato allies .
this week , turkey granted the u.s. permission to inspect its ports and airbases , and on tuesday , a private television station reported turkey had decided to allow u2 spy planes to fly over turkish airspace en route to iraq .
turkey has also long provided support to british and american warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone over northern iraq , set up in 1991 after the gulf war .
a divided europe turkey 's position is made even more difficult by internal splits between eu members .
although british prime minister tony blair has urged the rest of europe to stand shoulder to shoulder with u.s. president george w. bush , germany is still unequivocal that it will take no part in a potential conflict , even under a u.n. mandate .
it 's a position that could also influence turkey 's eventual stance on the issue .
germany has a close , if slightly troubled relationship with turkey .
the immigration and subsequent assimilation of millions of turks into germany in the decades following world war ii after the government invited them to help rebuild their country has raised major problems over citizenship in germany for many years .
the other major player in the eu , france , hinted for the first time this week it would pledge its own forces in a possible conflict , with french president jacques chirac telling his troops they should be prepared for war .
but he also reiterated his warning that the " international community should only resort to war as a last resort . "
whichever way turkey jumps , ankara is not expected to make any final decision until jan .
27th , when un weapons inspectors will present the first report on their findings in iraq .
meanwhile , both britain and the u.s are bracing for war with iraq .
the u.s has already stationed 60,000 troops in the persian gulf and sent its staff to a new battle headquarters in qatar .
britain has mobilized front-line troops and ships and called up 7,000 reservists .
a royal navy task force including a submarine and destroyer also set sail for the middle east last weekend . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey gets its date with the eu the eu said turkey could begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 , more than one year later than ankara had hoped for .

but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f4 phantoms were scrambled to track the rogue glider over frankfurt .
during the two-hour flight and attack threat in frankfurt , military phantom jets shadowed the glider while city authorities ordered thousands of people to leave the main rail station , two opera houses and several skyscrapers which were mostly empty on a post-christmas season sunday afternoon .
schröder , struck and regional minister would decide it emerged on monday that chancellor gerhard schröder had been regularly kept informed of developments during the scare despite the outcome being deemed a minor security worry .
in the event of a larger threat , the chancellor would have been responsible for ordering the aircraft to be shot down .
the decision would have been made jointly with the defense minister peter struck and a senior regional politician in frankfurt , officials confirmed .
the defense minister himself offered little new information regarding the government 's stance on the " deadly force " option .
struck said in the german daily berliner morgenpost that action must be appropriate to the situation at hand .
speaking about possible responses to aerial threats , struck said , " one must balance -lrb- the response -rrb- with what happens when a plane approaches a skyscraper with terrorist aims . "
wendroth said that the security forces ' handling of the incident " had gone very well . "
he added that the liaison between german air security staff and nato officials , responsible for overall air safety in europe , had been " very smooth and close .

during a diplomatic visit to turkey on wednesday , britain 's defense secretary seeks a secure commitment that turkey will make its military bases available to allies if war against iraq breaks out . bordering both iraq and syria , turkish military bases played a crucial role in the gulf war in the early ' 90s , and the west is hoping turkey will provide the same support if it resorts to war against saddam hussein a second time around .
but although british defense secretary geoff hoon emphasized the " common approach " the two countries took on international issues during a visit to ankara on wednesday , his turkish counterpart , vecdi gonul , remained cautious , telling reporters he still hoped for a peaceful outcome to the crisis .
" so far we have not formed any alliances , conducted any talks , or made any future plans on the issue of iraq outside the nato framework , " gonul said .
leaning toward the west ?
turkey , which is a nato member and is eager to join the european union , may soon be faced with a difficult choice .
opinion polls show that over 90 percent of turks are against military action in a country where over 99 percent of the population is muslim .
the turkish government is also less than enthusiastic about the prospect of war , fearing economic and internal turmoil .
nevertheless , turkey 's newly elected justice and development party - which has been at pains to allay suspicions about its islamist roots - has already pledged at least limited support its american and european nato allies .
this week , turkey granted the u.s. permission to inspect its ports and airbases , and on tuesday , a private television station reported turkey had decided to allow u2 spy planes to fly over turkish airspace en route to iraq .
turkey has also long provided support to british and american warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone over northern iraq , set up in 1991 after the gulf war .
a divided europe turkey 's position is made even more difficult by internal splits between eu members .
although british prime minister tony blair has urged the rest of europe to stand shoulder to shoulder with u.s. president george w. bush , germany is still unequivocal that it will take no part in a potential conflict , even under a u.n. mandate .
it 's a position that could also influence turkey 's eventual stance on the issue .
germany has a close , if slightly troubled relationship with turkey .
the immigration and subsequent assimilation of millions of turks into germany in the decades following world war ii after the government invited them to help rebuild their country has raised major problems over citizenship in germany for many years .
the other major player in the eu , france , hinted for the first time this week it would pledge its own forces in a possible conflict , with french president jacques chirac telling his troops they should be prepared for war .

during a diplomatic visit to turkey on wednesday , britain 's defense secretary seeks a secure commitment that turkey will make its military bases available to allies if war against iraq breaks out . bordering both iraq and syria , turkish military bases played a crucial role in the gulf war in the early ' 90s , and the west is hoping turkey will provide the same support if it resorts to war against saddam hussein a second time around .
but although british defense secretary geoff hoon emphasized the " common approach " the two countries took on international issues during a visit to ankara on wednesday , his turkish counterpart , vecdi gonul , remained cautious , telling reporters he still hoped for a peaceful outcome to the crisis .
" so far we have not formed any alliances , conducted any talks , or made any future plans on the issue of iraq outside the nato framework , " gonul said .
leaning toward the west ?
turkey , which is a nato member and is eager to join the european union , may soon be faced with a difficult choice .
opinion polls show that over 90 percent of turks are against military action in a country where over 99 percent of the population is muslim .
the turkish government is also less than enthusiastic about the prospect of war , fearing economic and internal turmoil .
nevertheless , turkey 's newly elected justice and development party - which has been at pains to allay suspicions about its islamist roots - has already pledged at least limited support its american and european nato allies .
this week , turkey granted the u.s. permission to inspect its ports and airbases , and on tuesday , a private television station reported turkey had decided to allow u2 spy planes to fly over turkish airspace en route to iraq .
turkey has also long provided support to british and american warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone over northern iraq , set up in 1991 after the gulf war .
a divided europe turkey 's position is made even more difficult by internal splits between eu members .
although british prime minister tony blair has urged the rest of europe to stand shoulder to shoulder with u.s. president george w. bush , germany is still unequivocal that it will take no part in a potential conflict , even under a u.n. mandate .
it 's a position that could also influence turkey 's eventual stance on the issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.01.2003 german air security debate remains grounded großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taking a closer look in the name of safety german officials prepare to tighten air security across the country in the wake of a recent frankfurt hijack .
but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f4 phantoms were scrambled to track the rogue glider over frankfurt .
during the two-hour flight and attack threat in frankfurt , military phantom jets shadowed the glider while city authorities ordered thousands of people to leave the main rail station , two opera houses and several skyscrapers which were mostly empty on a post-christmas season sunday afternoon .
schröder , struck and regional minister would decide it emerged on monday that chancellor gerhard schröder had been regularly kept informed of developments during the scare despite the outcome being deemed a minor security worry .
in the event of a larger threat , the chancellor would have been responsible for ordering the aircraft to be shot down .
the decision would have been made jointly with the defense minister peter struck and a senior regional politician in frankfurt , officials confirmed .
the defense minister himself offered little new information regarding the government 's stance on the " deadly force " option .
struck said in the german daily berliner morgenpost that action must be appropriate to the situation at hand .
speaking about possible responses to aerial threats , struck said , " one must balance -lrb- the response -rrb- with what happens when a plane approaches a skyscraper with terrorist aims . "
wendroth said that the security forces ' handling of the incident " had gone very well . "
he added that the liaison between german air security staff and nato officials , responsible for overall air safety in europe , had been " very smooth and close .

sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .

in the event of a larger threat , the chancellor would have been responsible for ordering the aircraft to be shot down .

struck said in the german daily berliner morgenpost that action must be appropriate to the situation at hand .
speaking about possible responses to aerial threats , struck said , " one must balance -lrb- the response -rrb- with what happens when a plane approaches a skyscraper with terrorist aims . "
wendroth said that the security forces ' handling of the incident " had gone very well . "

during a diplomatic visit to turkey on wednesday , britain 's defense secretary seeks a secure commitment that turkey will make its military bases available to allies if war against iraq breaks out . bordering both iraq and syria , turkish military bases played a crucial role in the gulf war in the early ' 90s , and the west is hoping turkey will provide the same support if it resorts to war against saddam hussein a second time around .
but although british defense secretary geoff hoon emphasized the " common approach " the two countries took on international issues during a visit to ankara on wednesday , his turkish counterpart , vecdi gonul , remained cautious , telling reporters he still hoped for a peaceful outcome to the crisis .
" so far we have not formed any alliances , conducted any talks , or made any future plans on the issue of iraq outside the nato framework , " gonul said .
leaning toward the west ?
turkey , which is a nato member and is eager to join the european union , may soon be faced with a difficult choice .
opinion polls show that over 90 percent of turks are against military action in a country where over 99 percent of the population is muslim .
the turkish government is also less than enthusiastic about the prospect of war , fearing economic and internal turmoil .
nevertheless , turkey 's newly elected justice and development party - which has been at pains to allay suspicions about its islamist roots - has already pledged at least limited support its american and european nato allies .
this week , turkey granted the u.s. permission to inspect its ports and airbases , and on tuesday , a private television station reported turkey had decided to allow u2 spy planes to fly over turkish airspace en route to iraq .
turkey has also long provided support to british and american warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone over northern iraq , set up in 1991 after the gulf war .
a divided europe turkey 's position is made even more difficult by internal splits between eu members .
although british prime minister tony blair has urged the rest of europe to stand shoulder to shoulder with u.s. president george w. bush , germany is still unequivocal that it will take no part in a potential conflict , even under a u.n. mandate .
it 's a position that could also influence turkey 's eventual stance on the issue .
germany has a close , if slightly troubled relationship with turkey .
the immigration and subsequent assimilation of millions of turks into germany in the decades following world war ii after the government invited them to help rebuild their country has raised major problems over citizenship in germany for many years .
the other major player in the eu , france , hinted for the first time this week it would pledge its own forces in a possible conflict , with french president jacques chirac telling his troops they should be prepared for war .
but he also reiterated his warning that the " international community should only resort to war as a last resort . "
whichever way turkey jumps , ankara is not expected to make any final decision until jan .
27th , when un weapons inspectors will present the first report on their findings in iraq .
meanwhile , both britain and the u.s are bracing for war with iraq .
the u.s has already stationed 60,000 troops in the persian gulf and sent its staff to a new battle headquarters in qatar .
britain has mobilized front-line troops and ships and called up 7,000 reservists .

but opinion is divided on the proposed last resort of deadly force in the event of an attack . germany 's airports face a security review after a man stole a motorized glider from a frankfurt airfield and threatened to crash it into the city 's financial center on the weekend , prompting fears of a terrorist attack .
roland koch , the governor of the state of hesse where frankfurt is situated , told the german daily bild zeitung that security at small airports like the one at babenhausen , the airfield from where 31-year-old psychology student franz stephan strambach stole the dimona tc 80 modern motorized glider , would be reviewed .
offiicals said that strambach forced his way onto the aircraft with an imitation gun before flying the glider around for two hours , making several threatening descents on skyscrapers - including the european central bank - before landing at frankfurt airport .
his flight-of-fancy caused the airport , continental europe 's busiest , to close while tall buildings in the city were evacuated , roads and bridges close and military jets were put on high alert .
concern around the country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lufthansa planes on the ground at frankfurt airport .
sunday 's incident has prompted concern at germany 's airports .
wilhelm bender , head of the frankfurt airport , reiterated koch 's sentiments by saying that overall security across germany 's network needed to be tightened .
" apparently it was possible for someone with a pistol simply to walk in and take an airplane , " bender said also in bild zeitung .
" it 's sad that a crazy person succeeded in paralyzing an entire city for hours . "
bender added that the authorities would be complacent to argue simply that the frankfurt incident had ended peacefully , and pointed to the security risks and high costs involved .
the incident had cost the airport " hundreds of thousands of euros " in damages because of flight delays , he said .
access to airports , security at border fencing and identity checks have been subject to improvements across germany since september 11 , but officials maintain that these improvements are ongoing and will continue to be reviewed .
to shoot down or not to shoot down ?
security officials are unanimous that new measures to prevent such situations in the future must be implemented .
but the incident again raises the question of action after the fact .
if an aircraft is successfully commandeered by a person or people intent on causing loss of life on a major scale , should that aircraft , with passengers and crew onboard , be shot down ?
in berlin , lieutenant colonel hannes wendroth , a defense ministry spokesman , told the financial times that the specialist panel set up after the terrorist attacks in the united states in 2001 to review appropriate responses to aerial threats from rogue aircraft had yet to reach any conclusions on what action to take .
asked whether the military would have been allowed to shoot down the plane , wendroth said , " you would need to take special care in deciding to do that over a built-up area . "
" once it emerged that this plane had nothing but the pilot and fuel on board , it could certainly be supposed that it would come down of its own accord , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : f4 phantoms were scrambled to track the rogue glider over frankfurt .
during the two-hour flight and attack threat in frankfurt , military phantom jets shadowed the glider while city authorities ordered thousands of people to leave the main rail station , two opera houses and several skyscrapers which were mostly empty on a post-christmas season sunday afternoon .
schröder , struck and regional minister would decide it emerged on monday that chancellor gerhard schröder had been regularly kept informed of developments during the scare despite the outcome being deemed a minor security worry .
in the event of a larger threat , the chancellor would have been responsible for ordering the aircraft to be shot down .
the decision would have been made jointly with the defense minister peter struck and a senior regional politician in frankfurt , officials confirmed .
the defense minister himself offered little new information regarding the government 's stance on the " deadly force " option .
struck said in the german daily berliner morgenpost that action must be appropriate to the situation at hand .
speaking about possible responses to aerial threats , struck said , " one must balance -lrb- the response -rrb- with what happens when a plane approaches a skyscraper with terrorist aims . "
wendroth said that the security forces ' handling of the incident " had gone very well . "
he added that the liaison between german air security staff and nato officials , responsible for overall air safety in europe , had been " very smooth and close .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 08.01.2003 british woo turkey for support in campaign against iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.s. wants to use turkish military bases .
during a diplomatic visit to turkey on wednesday , britain 's defense secretary seeks a secure commitment that turkey will make its military bases available to allies if war against iraq breaks out . bordering both iraq and syria , turkish military bases played a crucial role in the gulf war in the early ' 90s , and the west is hoping turkey will provide the same support if it resorts to war against saddam hussein a second time around .
but although british defense secretary geoff hoon emphasized the " common approach " the two countries took on international issues during a visit to ankara on wednesday , his turkish counterpart , vecdi gonul , remained cautious , telling reporters he still hoped for a peaceful outcome to the crisis .
" so far we have not formed any alliances , conducted any talks , or made any future plans on the issue of iraq outside the nato framework , " gonul said .
leaning toward the west ?
turkey , which is a nato member and is eager to join the european union , may soon be faced with a difficult choice .
opinion polls show that over 90 percent of turks are against military action in a country where over 99 percent of the population is muslim .
the turkish government is also less than enthusiastic about the prospect of war , fearing economic and internal turmoil .
nevertheless , turkey 's newly elected justice and development party - which has been at pains to allay suspicions about its islamist roots - has already pledged at least limited support its american and european nato allies .
this week , turkey granted the u.s. permission to inspect its ports and airbases , and on tuesday , a private television station reported turkey had decided to allow u2 spy planes to fly over turkish airspace en route to iraq .
turkey has also long provided support to british and american warplanes patrolling the no-fly zone over northern iraq , set up in 1991 after the gulf war .
a divided europe turkey 's position is made even more difficult by internal splits between eu members .
although british prime minister tony blair has urged the rest of europe to stand shoulder to shoulder with u.s. president george w. bush , germany is still unequivocal that it will take no part in a potential conflict , even under a u.n. mandate .
it 's a position that could also influence turkey 's eventual stance on the issue .
germany has a close , if slightly troubled relationship with turkey .
the immigration and subsequent assimilation of millions of turks into germany in the decades following world war ii after the government invited them to help rebuild their country has raised major problems over citizenship in germany for many years .
the other major player in the eu , france , hinted for the first time this week it would pledge its own forces in a possible conflict , with french president jacques chirac telling his troops they should be prepared for war .
but he also reiterated his warning that the " international community should only resort to war as a last resort . "
whichever way turkey jumps , ankara is not expected to make any final decision until jan .
27th , when un weapons inspectors will present the first report on their findings in iraq .
meanwhile , both britain and the u.s are bracing for war with iraq .
the u.s has already stationed 60,000 troops in the persian gulf and sent its staff to a new battle headquarters in qatar .
britain has mobilized front-line troops and ships and called up 7,000 reservists .
a royal navy task force including a submarine and destroyer also set sail for the middle east last weekend . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkey gets its date with the eu the eu said turkey could begin negotiations for entry at the end of 2004 , more than one year later than ankara had hoped for .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 08.01.2003 german carmakers unveil suvs and beetles in detroit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from grocery store to beach , german carmakers hope to dominate the u.s. in 2003 in motor city detroit , german automakers from volkswagen to porsche are demonstrating their plans to conquer the sport utility sector .
they also predict a big year for the new mini and the vw beetle convertible . for most of the large german carmakers at the detroit motor show , the optimism on display here is more than just show - it can be expressed in raw sales .
bmw , for example , sold more than 144,000 of its new mini coopers worldwide , including 25,000 on the american market last year - a sales record for the munich-based company .
organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw touareg over at volkswagen , board member jens neumann said the company is seeking to regain its lost ground this year with its new touareg luxury suv -lrb- photo -rrb- .
initially , two versions of touareg will be sold - one with a v6 engine starting at $ 34,900 and a second with a v8 engine and a pricetag starting at $ 40,700 .
the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .
in that regard , the introduction of the touareg is important , since the company does n't currently sell any models in this crucial american market segment .
most importantly , neumann says , the touareg will help volkswagen reach new target groups .
" the great thing is that we 're able to offer individualized cars fulfilling the most customer wishes possible while still keeping down our base costs and the prices at which we can offer them , " neumann said .
reincarnating an old favorite the wolfsburg , germany-based carmaker is also unveiling the new beetle convertible in detroit , the successor to the new beetle , introduced in 1998 .
more than 400,000 new beetles have been sold in the united states and the company is hoping for even greater success with its long-awaited convertible follow-up .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche cayenne stuttgart-based porsche is pursuing a similar strategy with its new cayenne suv -lrb- photo -rrb- , which it hopes will attract fans of the porsche brand who are n't looking to buy a sports car .
the powerful cayenne can motor from 0-62 miles per hour in just seven seconds and will carry a starting price tag of $ 55,000 .
volkswagen subsidiary audi is also jumping into the fray with the prototype pikes peak quattro suv , with which it intends to compete against its mother company and porsche .
the car packs in an impressive 500 horsepower engine - a souped up v8 the company says is capable of accelerating to 60 miles per hour in 4.7 seconds .
in another significant market development , vw , mercedes and daimlerchrysler are all planning to unveil models next year that consume diesel fuel rather than normal gasoline .
last year , american carmaker ford said it was considering sales of diesel models in order to reduce gasoline consumption in the u.s. but it still appears to be a limited development , since a sparse number of diesel-fueled cars have been sold in the u.s. in recent decades and the technology remains relatively under-developed there .
however , if companies are able to succeed in developing diesel motors with modern fuel injection for the u.s. market , companies based in germany , where diesel-fueled cars are common , could have a clear competitive advantage . arthur landwehr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

they also predict a big year for the new mini and the vw beetle convertible . for most of the large german carmakers at the detroit motor show , the optimism on display here is more than just show - it can be expressed in raw sales .
bmw , for example , sold more than 144,000 of its new mini coopers worldwide , including 25,000 on the american market last year - a sales record for the munich-based company .
organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw touareg over at volkswagen , board member jens neumann said the company is seeking to regain its lost ground this year with its new touareg luxury suv -lrb- photo -rrb- .
initially , two versions of touareg will be sold - one with a v6 engine starting at $ 34,900 and a second with a v8 engine and a pricetag starting at $ 40,700 .
the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .
in that regard , the introduction of the touareg is important , since the company does n't currently sell any models in this crucial american market segment .
most importantly , neumann says , the touareg will help volkswagen reach new target groups .
" the great thing is that we 're able to offer individualized cars fulfilling the most customer wishes possible while still keeping down our base costs and the prices at which we can offer them , " neumann said .
reincarnating an old favorite the wolfsburg , germany-based carmaker is also unveiling the new beetle convertible in detroit , the successor to the new beetle , introduced in 1998 .

the company is setting its sights on a growing market , too - more than half of the cars now sold in the u.s. are suvs or vans .

they also predict a big year for the new mini and the vw beetle convertible . for most of the large german carmakers at the detroit motor show , the optimism on display here is more than just show - it can be expressed in raw sales .
bmw , for example , sold more than 144,000 of its new mini coopers worldwide , including 25,000 on the american market last year - a sales record for the munich-based company .
organizers of the detroit show also named the new mini " car of the year . "
mercedes also clocked impressive sales gains in 2002 - with an increase of 3 percent to 210,000 cars .
audi posted similarly rosy results .
and even though the overall market share of german carmakers remained far lower than for their american counterparts , the companies did prove that with the right car models , you can perform well even in a period of economic uncertainty and doldrums .
thus , top executives in the german automobile industry are betting on strong gains in 2003 , even as the american market itself shrinks .
" it does n't help any of us to sit around and just forecast crises , " said jürgen hubbert , chairman of daimlerchrysler .
" we have to live with the situation as it is .
and last year we set the example , showing that you can find success with the right products .
if you talk to the people , success will come .
for that reason , i 'm optimistic about 2003 . "
under the mercedes brand , daimlerchrysler is unveiling for the first time a four-wheel drive model in the c class as well as an e-class station wagon and a new sl 600 , which hubbert hopes will increase mercedes sales in north america .
still , the market could prove more daunting for other german manufacturers like volkswagen and porsche .
last year , vw sales in the u.s. sank five percent to a total of 340,000 cars .
porsche sales fell a more dramatic 7 percent to 22,500 cars .
third-best year ever despite a difficult overall economic environment in the u.s. in 2002 , the automobile industry performed its third-best year ever , with sales of more than 16 million cars .
but the price for those sales was high , with companies offering rebates as high as $ 3,000 and interest-free financing .
most german companies sought to avoid deals that would jeopardize bottom lines without , for the most part , much reason for regret .
" it demonstrates that manufacturers with a clear profile - and i do n't just mean bmw , but rather european premium manufacturers in general - can become considerably more successful than interchangeable brands , " said helmut panke , chairman of bmw .
panke also said he believes german carmakers are relatively immune to hiccups in the u.s. economy .
he says the market for high-end cars is less susceptible to fluctuations in the market .
it 's a sentiment shared by others in the industry .

nigeria 's poverty fuels its corruption the commission to fight corruption was one of the bodies set up by president olusegun obasanjo soon after he came into office in 1999 .
but in all that time , its work has led to the conviction of just one public official .
now the commission has sprung a surprise by launching an investigation into the activities of the country 's most influential politicians .
timing parliament has responded to this by challenging the activities of the anti-corruption commission itself .
is this an act of self preservation by the politicians or just a coincidence of timing ?
senator mamman ali argues strongly for the latter .
i was offered a parcel with three million naira -lsb- about $ 20,000 -rsb- senator mamman ali " it 's a total coincidence , " he said .
" we have certain issues as individuals against the anti-corruption commission , but in the conduct of our legislative duties we do n't have to take personal issues that far . "
but for nigerians , this latest challenge to the work of the anti-corruption commission only strengthens the belief that the politicians have something to hide .
" if the law says they should be prosecuted , they should be prosecuted , because nobody is above the law .
i do n't think anybody should be above the law , " said one .
parliamentary theatre accusations of corruption are not just from ordinary individuals or the media , but from within the senate itself .
the best way to fight corruption is through leadership by example senator saidu mohammed dansadau recently , in a remarkable piece of parliamentary theatre , senator mamman ali walked to the front of the chamber and handed over a large bag full of cash .
he said it had been given to him in order to influence his vote in parliament .
" i was confronted by some people in my house : ' take this , then you forget ' , " he said .
" i was offered a parcel with three million naira -lsb- about $ 20,000 -rsb- .
" i was confronted by them .
i had never known them , so i said , ' ok , thank you . '
i collected it and immediately moved to the senate floor . "
important test it is the source of that money , alleged to have been handed out to many other senators in return for voting against a motion to impeach president obasanjo , which the anti-corruption commission is attempting to investigate .
president obasanjo set up the commission when he came to power chairman , justice mustapha akambi , believes it will be an important test of the commission 's powers .
" i want to believe that in the final analysis , this is a test case of whether any anti-corruption in this country will work in accordance with the law that established it , " he said .
but whilst the anti-corruption commission can investigate , cases are almost invariably delayed or thrown out by the courts .
example just one minor official convicted in three years is not an impressive record .
senator saidu mohammed dansadau , of the newly-formed senate committee of corrupt practices , is certainly not impressed with that record .
" the best way to fight corruption is through leadership by example , " he said .
" i believe rather than reducing , corruption is getting higher and higher .
what we require is the political will by the president and the leadership to fight corruption . "
the senator is saying no more than what all nigerians know at heart - it does no good setting up committees and identifying corrupt practices if nigeria 's leaders fail to condemn loudly and at every opportunity , financial misconduct at the highest level .

nigeria 's poverty fuels its corruption the commission to fight corruption was one of the bodies set up by president olusegun obasanjo soon after he came into office in 1999 .

the programme , released ahead of a planning meeting for economic ministers , aims to bolster corporate investment while curbing household debt .
it is also designed to ready the economy for foreign exchange volatility and a surge in the price of oil .
the finance ministry is to loosen its purse strings , while stepping up its intervention in the currency and commodity markets , and says it remains confident of keeping annual economic growth above 5 % .
but analysts have criticised the plan , arguing that it is insufficiently detailed , and that it underestimates the external risks faced by the korean economy .
spending and saving " domestic consumption has recently weakened and external conditions for our exports have become greatly uncertain , " the finance ministry said in a statement .
" therefore , we need policies aimed at boosting investment to prevent domestic demand from cooling further and sapping the economy 's growth potential . "
the commerce ministry said last week the country 's top 200 manufacturing companies were planning to boost capital spending by more than 10 % this year .
it has also argued that investment is the best way of underpinning south korea 's recent economic revival .
at the same time , the government is to increase its supervision of the consumer loan sector , which has boomed in recent years thanks mainly to low interest rates .
although korean personal debt is very low by international standards , ministers are concerned that it could eventually prove a source of instability .
too little , too late ?
not everyone was impressed , however .
" the economic plan seems to be based on an optimism that uncertainties surrounding north korea and the middle east would go away soon , " said lee soo-hee , an economist at korea economic research institute .
" in addition , it lacks details on what to do in case the dollar weakens against other major currencies more steeply than thought . "
south korea is highly reliant on imports of industrial commodities , especially oil , and is therefore vulnerable to any crisis in the middle east .
and recent signs that communist north korea is stepping up its controversial nuclear programme have sparked further fears of instability in the region .

uk defence secretary geoff hoon has announced the call-up of reservists across the uk but the labour mp for newport west , paul flynn , has warned that there is little support among the public for the possible conflict .
a total of 1,500 reservists from across the uk will soon be told that they are to be called up .
those from wales - mainly medical and intelligence experts - will find out who they are when the letters arrive on their doormats .
territorial army -lrb- ta -rrb- members and other reservists come from all walks of life and are known as the ' weekend soldiers ' .
they train on a part-time basis , normally at weekends , and attend an annual two-week camp .
some of these part-time soldiers can expect to receive their call-up papers in the next few days as the west gears up for a possible war with iraq .
medics were the first group of reserve soldiers to be called into action during the gulf war in 1991 and defence experts have predicted the same thing is about to happen again .
but according to mr flynn , there is little support among welsh voters for the feared conflict and he has called for the house of commons to have a vote on the call-up issue .
he said : " give us a chance of escaping from our present link as a junior partner with the united states in this axis of delusion . "
the uk government 's call-up notices gives the employers of the ta service people time to prepare for their absence .
the salary of ta soldiers depends on their rank .
the scale begins at £ 25 per day for a private and goes up to £ 175 per day for a senior officer .
all members of the ta are given an annual payment of £ 1,250 .
this is only guaranteed after soldiers have been with the ta for five years and have completed all necessary training .

a special ceremony was held at rugby station last year to mark the completion of the major restoration project .
but just months later , it has been revealed the station could be torn down and rebuilt elsewhere as part of plans to modernise the main route between the midlands and london .
two new fast tracks could be built where the station now stands .
' lousy timing ' councillor gordon collett , of rugby borough council , told the bbc 's midlands today programme : " my first reaction was total disbelief .
" the paint is hardly dry and indeed , people are still working here and they are talking about knocking it down .
" i have to say , the timing is absolutely lousy . "
in a statement , the strategic rail authority confirmed that it was " considering the nature of and extent to which the station can be redeveloped " .
it added that it would publish its conclusions and proposals early this year .
it is believed that an announcement on the future of the station could be made as early as next month .

alistair burt , the conservative mp for north east bedfordshire , was speaking after government plans to put a new secure unit within the existing oakington reception centre in cambridgeshire were leaked to the bbc .
opponents say any centre for detainees awaiting deportation could suffer a similar fate to yarl 's wood , largely destroyed in a fire after a riot last february .
mr burt said : " i do n't think anything should be done with detention and removal centres until the home office has published the results of its inquiry into what happened at yarl 's wood . "
he added : " there was a problem about those who were detained , and we believe it led to the incident . "
the bbc has been told there are plans to create a secure deportation centre for 150 people within the oakington site .
currently , oakington is a relatively low-key operation housing refugees awaiting the outcome of asylum applications .
when it opened in 1999 ministers were quick to reasure local people that security at the centre would not be an issue .
a home office spokesman said on tuesday : " i ca n't confirm that we 'll be building any new buildings or converting any existing buildings on the land .
the fears over oakington have arisen as new measures concerning asylum seekers come into force nationwide .
from wednesday , those who do not apply for asylum until well after their arrival in the uk will not be eligible for state support .
