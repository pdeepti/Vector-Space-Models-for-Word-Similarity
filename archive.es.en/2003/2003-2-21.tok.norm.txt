program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 21.02.2003 ten new countries listed for eu membership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ten new flags will join those outside the commission headquarters in 2004 the european commission recommends ten candidate countries to join the european union in 2004 , but fails to give turkey a date . ten countries were given the green light to join the european union by 2004 on wednesday . in a report on 13 candidate countries , the european commission recommended ten countries for accession , including cyprus , the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , malta , poland , slovakia and slovenia , but failed to mention turkey . two countries , bulgaria and romania will join in 2007 , the report said . turkey still expects a date this year in the report the commission maintains that “ turkey does not fully meet the political criteria . ” despite the abolishment of capital punishment this year , its human rights record remains poor : torture and ill-treatment in detention are still regular occurrences in turkey , and the eu has repeatedly expressed concern on the failure to ensure freedom of expression and religion and the right to free association and assembly . on wednesday , turkey ’ s foreign minister sukru sina gurel dismissed the eu ’ s recommendations as being merely technical .
he said the eu could still name an accession date for turkey by the end of the year if the political will was there . “ -lsb- if the eu -rsb- fails this test that will reflect adversely on other aspects of turkish-eu relations ” , reuters quoted gurel . turkish deputy prime minister mesut yilmaz told the press that turkey still expects to be given a concrete date before january 2003 . still a long way to go for the ten in its assessment of the ten accession candidates ’ progress the commission pin-pointed numerous deficiencies , above all in the administration and legal systems in most of the future member states .
more than half of the ten – the czech republic , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia – were warned that they needed to clamp down harder on corruption . the commission also informed the czech republic , hungary and slovakia that their efforts to integrate ethnic groups including roma citizens had not gone far enough . on cyprus , the eu said it was optimistic about the state joining the union , despite the fact that it is still only able to negotiate with the internationally-accepted ethnic greek administration in the south . the question of membership for cyprus has been reason for dispute between turkey and the eu .
turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash has already warned the island will remain divided if the island acedes the eu .
turkey has even gone as far as to threaten to annex the turkish north if cyprus joins the eu before a settlement between the turkish and the cypriotic side has been found . in addition , greece has said it would veto the entire enlargement process if the eu failed to include cyprus . 40 million euros in the first three years howeverm one of the most difficult problems still facing the eu is how to finance enlargement .
the commission estimated that integration of new members will cost 40 billion euros within the first three years .
the issue will be addressed at the next eu summit in brussels on october 24 and 25 . there are still concerns among current eu countries that the new members will pay more into brussel 's purse than they will get out of it .
in an interview with german radio , günter verheugen , the eu ’ s commissioner for enlargement , pointed out that growth rates are higher in the countries of central and eastern europe than the eu average .
“ it ’ s not a prerequisite for membership to be rich . ... we are not a club of the rich , ” he insisted . at issue , among other things , are both structural aid to poor regions and agricultural subsidies .
on tuesday , poland , the biggest of the ten candidates , made first attempts at altering its demands for farming subsidies , recognizing the unlikelihood that polish farmers would receive the same generous subsidies as those currently in the eu do . precarious ground but there are still dangers that the enlargement project could collapse .
a further obstacle is the irish referendum on the nice treaty on october 19 , the blueprint for internal reforms which will help the eu to adapt to additional members . the treaty regulates enlargement and must be ratified by all states involved - ireland is the only member which has not yet accepted the treaty .
as günter verheugen said in a statement earlier this year , “ there are still great barriers to be overcome . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

he said the eu could still name an accession date for turkey by the end of the year if the political will was there . “ -lsb- if the eu -rsb- fails this test that will reflect adversely on other aspects of turkish-eu relations ” , reuters quoted gurel . turkish deputy prime minister mesut yilmaz told the press that turkey still expects to be given a concrete date before january 2003 . still a long way to go for the ten in its assessment of the ten accession candidates ’ progress the commission pin-pointed numerous deficiencies , above all in the administration and legal systems in most of the future member states .
more than half of the ten – the czech republic , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia – were warned that they needed to clamp down harder on corruption . the commission also informed the czech republic , hungary and slovakia that their efforts to integrate ethnic groups including roma citizens had not gone far enough . on cyprus , the eu said it was optimistic about the state joining the union , despite the fact that it is still only able to negotiate with the internationally-accepted ethnic greek administration in the south . the question of membership for cyprus has been reason for dispute between turkey and the eu .
turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash has already warned the island will remain divided if the island acedes the eu .
turkey has even gone as far as to threaten to annex the turkish north if cyprus joins the eu before a settlement between the turkish and the cypriotic side has been found . in addition , greece has said it would veto the entire enlargement process if the eu failed to include cyprus . 40 million euros in the first three years howeverm one of the most difficult problems still facing the eu is how to finance enlargement .
the commission estimated that integration of new members will cost 40 billion euros within the first three years .
the issue will be addressed at the next eu summit in brussels on october 24 and 25 . there are still concerns among current eu countries that the new members will pay more into brussel 's purse than they will get out of it .
in an interview with german radio , günter verheugen , the eu ’ s commissioner for enlargement , pointed out that growth rates are higher in the countries of central and eastern europe than the eu average .

he said the eu could still name an accession date for turkey by the end of the year if the political will was there . “ -lsb- if the eu -rsb- fails this test that will reflect adversely on other aspects of turkish-eu relations ” , reuters quoted gurel . turkish deputy prime minister mesut yilmaz told the press that turkey still expects to be given a concrete date before january 2003 . still a long way to go for the ten in its assessment of the ten accession candidates ’ progress the commission pin-pointed numerous deficiencies , above all in the administration and legal systems in most of the future member states .

turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash has already warned the island will remain divided if the island acedes the eu .
turkey has even gone as far as to threaten to annex the turkish north if cyprus joins the eu before a settlement between the turkish and the cypriotic side has been found . in addition , greece has said it would veto the entire enlargement process if the eu failed to include cyprus . 40 million euros in the first three years howeverm one of the most difficult problems still facing the eu is how to finance enlargement .
the commission estimated that integration of new members will cost 40 billion euros within the first three years .
the issue will be addressed at the next eu summit in brussels on october 24 and 25 . there are still concerns among current eu countries that the new members will pay more into brussel 's purse than they will get out of it .
in an interview with german radio , günter verheugen , the eu ’ s commissioner for enlargement , pointed out that growth rates are higher in the countries of central and eastern europe than the eu average .

he said the eu could still name an accession date for turkey by the end of the year if the political will was there . “ -lsb- if the eu -rsb- fails this test that will reflect adversely on other aspects of turkish-eu relations ” , reuters quoted gurel . turkish deputy prime minister mesut yilmaz told the press that turkey still expects to be given a concrete date before january 2003 . still a long way to go for the ten in its assessment of the ten accession candidates ’ progress the commission pin-pointed numerous deficiencies , above all in the administration and legal systems in most of the future member states .
more than half of the ten – the czech republic , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia – were warned that they needed to clamp down harder on corruption . the commission also informed the czech republic , hungary and slovakia that their efforts to integrate ethnic groups including roma citizens had not gone far enough . on cyprus , the eu said it was optimistic about the state joining the union , despite the fact that it is still only able to negotiate with the internationally-accepted ethnic greek administration in the south . the question of membership for cyprus has been reason for dispute between turkey and the eu .
turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash has already warned the island will remain divided if the island acedes the eu .
turkey has even gone as far as to threaten to annex the turkish north if cyprus joins the eu before a settlement between the turkish and the cypriotic side has been found . in addition , greece has said it would veto the entire enlargement process if the eu failed to include cyprus . 40 million euros in the first three years howeverm one of the most difficult problems still facing the eu is how to finance enlargement .
the commission estimated that integration of new members will cost 40 billion euros within the first three years .
the issue will be addressed at the next eu summit in brussels on october 24 and 25 . there are still concerns among current eu countries that the new members will pay more into brussel 's purse than they will get out of it .
in an interview with german radio , günter verheugen , the eu ’ s commissioner for enlargement , pointed out that growth rates are higher in the countries of central and eastern europe than the eu average .
“ it ’ s not a prerequisite for membership to be rich . ... we are not a club of the rich , ” he insisted . at issue , among other things , are both structural aid to poor regions and agricultural subsidies .
on tuesday , poland , the biggest of the ten candidates , made first attempts at altering its demands for farming subsidies , recognizing the unlikelihood that polish farmers would receive the same generous subsidies as those currently in the eu do . precarious ground but there are still dangers that the enlargement project could collapse .
a further obstacle is the irish referendum on the nice treaty on october 19 , the blueprint for internal reforms which will help the eu to adapt to additional members . the treaty regulates enlargement and must be ratified by all states involved - ireland is the only member which has not yet accepted the treaty .
as günter verheugen said in a statement earlier this year , “ there are still great barriers to be overcome . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a year and half ago , the 23 year- old had an accident which rendered her blind .
she used to work on restoring books , but the loss of her sight made that impossible . at first she thought her disability meant she was now doomed to taking " a typical blind job " .
but with help from the berlin blind association , verena was given her life back .
she now works at berlin 's trendy " un-sicht bar " , a restaurant where guests eat completely in the dark . it 's stories like verena 's that the eu wants to promote , making it clear that being disabled is not a barrier to living life to the full .
with € 12 million -lrb- $ 13 million -rrb- earmarked by the eu , more than 1,000 projects , seminars and awareness-raising campaigns will take place during the year of the disabled in 2003 , which was officially opened by the german health minister ulla schmidt in mageburg , saxony anhalt , on friday . march for integration one of the biggest initiatives is a people 's march for integration .

although an anti-discrimination law is planned , insufficient support in the german parliament has meant it is yet to be implemented .
however , since 1994 a clause in the german constitution states no german citizen may be disadvantaged because of any disabilities .
and an equal opportunities law has also been in force since 2002 .
in the future , the german government wants to add to it , planning to make all public transport , and sport and social events accessible to disabled people . the european union , meanwhile , is going full steam ahead with its own equal opportunities legislation .

but its 29-year division leaves the european union and world community uneasy . after months of talk , the european union in december made good on its promise to welcome cyprus into its fold , even without the northern turkish third of the island . the eu accepted the southern , greek portion of the island as a full member , as the united nations rushed to get turkish and greek cypriots to agree on a plan for reunification .
after almost 30 years of failed diplomatic efforts by the international community , many thought the un plan was the best possible shot at bringing both sides together . but the february victory of tassos papadopoulos in the cypriotic presidential elections has jeopardized a possible agreement , with a feb .
28 acceptance deadline just days away . papadopoulos , who replaced longtime president glafcos clerides , said he wants to make changes to a plan many greek cypriots thought was weighted against them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the cypriot flag it is a tense situation for a country considered among the very best candidates for eu membership . the republic of cyprus , established in 1960 and divided following the turkish army ’ s invasion in 1974 , is on its way to filling most of brussels ’ strict and extensive requirements for accession .
the country ’ s progress reports since negotiation began in 1998 read like those of a star pupil . brussels has glowing remarks for the country ’ s steps in liberalizing its economy and nicosia ’ s efforts in intensifying its economic links to europe .
the population is also almost overwhelmingly in favor of accession . a tumultuous history “ cyprus is a functioning market economy and it should be able to cope with competitive pressure and market forces within the union , ” reads a recent report . only cyprus ’ s divided history stands in the way now . the united nations ’ reunification plan lays out three options for unifying the two states and gives both sides until feb .
28 to approve it .
the plan is considered by many the best in the offing since division . the republic of cyprus has a majority in population and wants to be careful not to give up too much .
the rotating 10-month presidency that is to be shared by both sides will be a difficult pill to swallow . papadopoulos also wants the right of return for all greek cypriotic refugees to the turkish northern third , as opposed to the current proposal giving only 50 percent that right . the turkish north of cyprus , recognized only by turkey , wants its sovereignty to be recognized before it enters into the sort of confederation of states the un envisages .

a year and half ago , the 23 year- old had an accident which rendered her blind .
she used to work on restoring books , but the loss of her sight made that impossible . at first she thought her disability meant she was now doomed to taking " a typical blind job " .
but with help from the berlin blind association , verena was given her life back .
she now works at berlin 's trendy " un-sicht bar " , a restaurant where guests eat completely in the dark . it 's stories like verena 's that the eu wants to promote , making it clear that being disabled is not a barrier to living life to the full .
with € 12 million -lrb- $ 13 million -rrb- earmarked by the eu , more than 1,000 projects , seminars and awareness-raising campaigns will take place during the year of the disabled in 2003 , which was officially opened by the german health minister ulla schmidt in mageburg , saxony anhalt , on friday . march for integration one of the biggest initiatives is a people 's march for integration .

although an anti-discrimination law is planned , insufficient support in the german parliament has meant it is yet to be implemented .
however , since 1994 a clause in the german constitution states no german citizen may be disadvantaged because of any disabilities .
and an equal opportunities law has also been in force since 2002 .
in the future , the german government wants to add to it , planning to make all public transport , and sport and social events accessible to disabled people . the european union , meanwhile , is going full steam ahead with its own equal opportunities legislation .

he said the eu could still name an accession date for turkey by the end of the year if the political will was there . “ -lsb- if the eu -rsb- fails this test that will reflect adversely on other aspects of turkish-eu relations ” , reuters quoted gurel . turkish deputy prime minister mesut yilmaz told the press that turkey still expects to be given a concrete date before january 2003 . still a long way to go for the ten in its assessment of the ten accession candidates ’ progress the commission pin-pointed numerous deficiencies , above all in the administration and legal systems in most of the future member states .
more than half of the ten – the czech republic , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland and slovakia – were warned that they needed to clamp down harder on corruption . the commission also informed the czech republic , hungary and slovakia that their efforts to integrate ethnic groups including roma citizens had not gone far enough . on cyprus , the eu said it was optimistic about the state joining the union , despite the fact that it is still only able to negotiate with the internationally-accepted ethnic greek administration in the south . the question of membership for cyprus has been reason for dispute between turkey and the eu .
turkish cypriot leader rauf denktash has already warned the island will remain divided if the island acedes the eu .
turkey has even gone as far as to threaten to annex the turkish north if cyprus joins the eu before a settlement between the turkish and the cypriotic side has been found . in addition , greece has said it would veto the entire enlargement process if the eu failed to include cyprus . 40 million euros in the first three years howeverm one of the most difficult problems still facing the eu is how to finance enlargement .
the commission estimated that integration of new members will cost 40 billion euros within the first three years .
the issue will be addressed at the next eu summit in brussels on october 24 and 25 . there are still concerns among current eu countries that the new members will pay more into brussel 's purse than they will get out of it .
in an interview with german radio , günter verheugen , the eu ’ s commissioner for enlargement , pointed out that growth rates are higher in the countries of central and eastern europe than the eu average .
“ it ’ s not a prerequisite for membership to be rich . ... we are not a club of the rich , ” he insisted . at issue , among other things , are both structural aid to poor regions and agricultural subsidies .
on tuesday , poland , the biggest of the ten candidates , made first attempts at altering its demands for farming subsidies , recognizing the unlikelihood that polish farmers would receive the same generous subsidies as those currently in the eu do . precarious ground but there are still dangers that the enlargement project could collapse .
a further obstacle is the irish referendum on the nice treaty on october 19 , the blueprint for internal reforms which will help the eu to adapt to additional members . the treaty regulates enlargement and must be ratified by all states involved - ireland is the only member which has not yet accepted the treaty .

telstra cut the book value of reach by $ 546m to zero , a change which will be included in results next week .
" i am embarrassed by the need to make these write downs , " telstra chief executive ziggy switkowski said .
the joint venture was formed by telstra 's global wholesale business and hong kong telecom , owned by pccw , in 2000 to sell bandwidth for voice , data and the internet .
pccw reduced the book value by $ 1.06bn to $ 507.8m , a move which will hit profits when it reports full-year results in march .
market rates mr switkowski said neither telstra nor pccw planned to put more money into the joint venture .
falling revenues at reach , because of strong competition in the broadband market , was to blame , the companies said .
reach 's revenues were subsidised by above market rate contracts with telstra and pccw which made up about 40 % on earnings , mr switkowski said .
those contracts have finished and the joint venture partners now pay the market rate for bandwidth .
telstra shares fell to five-year lows after the announcement , closing down 3.9 % at a $ 4.20 while in hong kong , pccw fell 5.1 % .

saudi television said he was shot by a man in a vehicle which pulled up alongside him as he sat in his car at traffic lights , and he died immediately .
saudi authorities chased and caught the alleged assailant , a saudi of yemeni origin , named as saud bin ali bin nasser , 30 , who worked for a car dealership .
dent , originally from southport , merseyside , was employed by the british defence and aerospace company bae systems in saudi arabia .
his family , describing him as a " lovely man " , said he had been married for about 13 years and had two children .
violent incidents the killing comes amid rising tensions in the region .
on wednesday , the british government warned its nationals to leave iraq immediately , and to avoid all but essential travel to kuwait , israel and the palestinian territories .
it also comes after a string of violent incidents involving british nationals in the kingdom , the last one being a car bomb which killed a briton in june 2002 .
the saudi authorities blamed those incidents on an illegal alcohol racket and have arrested several britons in connection with the attacks .
however , the saudi ambassador to the uk , prince turki al-faisal , said on british television said that people should not jump to conclusions over the motive behind the shooting , which currently remains unknown .
" one should not allow speculation to be the norm but rather facts , " he told britain 's channel 4 news .
motive unknown thursday 's attack took place between 1600 and 1800 local time -lrb- 1300 and 1500 gmt -rrb- on khaled bin al-walid street in the granada district of riyadh .
paying tribute to mr dent , his uncle leslie said he " loved his children to bits " .
mr dent 's parents , bob and denise , were returning home after hearing the news while holidaying in spain , his uncle added .
bae systems spokesman mike sweeney said the company was " doing everything we can to support the family " , who were " very very upset " .
" we are saddened by this tragic event and the loss of a colleague . "
uk foreign secretary jack straw also expressed shock and regret at the killing .
it has also emerged that there have been two other attempted shootings against bae personnel in riyadh in the last three weeks , both unsuccessful , says the bbc 's paul adams , reporting from neighbouring kuwait .

saudi television said he was shot by a man in a vehicle which pulled up alongside him as he sat in his car at traffic lights , and he died immediately .
saudi authorities chased and caught the alleged assailant , a saudi of yemeni origin , named as saud bin ali bin nasser , 30 , who worked for a car dealership .
dent , originally from southport , merseyside , was employed by the british defence and aerospace company bae systems in saudi arabia .
his family , describing him as a " lovely man " , said he had been married for about 13 years and had two children .
violent incidents the killing comes amid rising tensions in the region .
on wednesday , the british government warned its nationals to leave iraq immediately , and to avoid all but essential travel to kuwait , israel and the palestinian territories .
it also comes after a string of violent incidents involving british nationals in the kingdom , the last one being a car bomb which killed a briton in june 2002 .
the saudi authorities blamed those incidents on an illegal alcohol racket and have arrested several britons in connection with the attacks .
however , the saudi ambassador to the uk , prince turki al-faisal , said on british television said that people should not jump to conclusions over the motive behind the shooting , which currently remains unknown .
" one should not allow speculation to be the norm but rather facts , " he told britain 's channel 4 news .
motive unknown thursday 's attack took place between 1600 and 1800 local time -lrb- 1300 and 1500 gmt -rrb- on khaled bin al-walid street in the granada district of riyadh .
paying tribute to mr dent , his uncle leslie said he " loved his children to bits " .
mr dent 's parents , bob and denise , were returning home after hearing the news while holidaying in spain , his uncle added .
bae systems spokesman mike sweeney said the company was " doing everything we can to support the family " , who were " very very upset " .
" we are saddened by this tragic event and the loss of a colleague . "
uk foreign secretary jack straw also expressed shock and regret at the killing .
it has also emerged that there have been two other attempted shootings against bae personnel in riyadh in the last three weeks , both unsuccessful , says the bbc 's paul adams , reporting from neighbouring kuwait .
westerners have also been killed in kuwait in recent months .
kuwait and saudi arabia are home to thousands of us troops , who are likely to take part in a possible war on iraq .
