the uefa cup final in seville on wednesday sees two clubs looking to reclaim their place among europe 's elite . two european clubs steeped in tradition will take to the field in seville 's estadio olímpico on wednesday night in the hopes of taking home the uefa cup and reclaiming their place among the continent 's soccer elite .
glasgow celtic 's last great triumph was when it won the european cup in 1967 .
fc porto won the same competition 20 years later , but has n't been in a european final since .
scottish invasion central seville was swamped in green and white on wednesday ahead of the match , as thousands of celtic fans kicked off their pre-match celebrations .
although the club was allocated only 15,000 tickets for the big game , thousands more are expected to arrive just for the party .
estimates range from 40,000 to 70,000 celtic supporters from glasgow and as far afield as the united states and australia .
most of the porto fans are expected to drive down just in time for the match .
porto injury-free porto coach jose mourinho has no serious injury worries .
he 's without suspended forward helder postiga , who was sent off in the semi-final , but midfielder francisco costinha has been declared fit again after he pulled a muscle in a domestic league match just over a week ago .
defender nuno valente , who was considered doubtful for the game , is also fit to line out .
mourinho is playing his cards close to his chest , and has yet to reveal who will partner derlei silva , the tournament 's top scorer with ten goals so far , up front .
he has a choice between edgaras jankauskas and nuno capucho , both of whom scored in saturday 's victory over varzim in the portuguese premier league .
he 's expected to use his standard back four of paolo ferreira , jorge costa , ricardo carvalho and valente .
as usual , vitor baia will be between the posts .
in midfield , costinha is likely to be joined by playmaker deco souza , maniche ribeiro and dmitri alenitchev .
hartson out for celtic celtic coach martin o 'neill will have to go without the services of striker john hartson , a key figure in their european campaign until now .
hartson has been ruled out due to a back injury .
but o 'neill can still count on a powerful strike force that includes chris sutton and henrik larsson , who has scored 28 league goals this season and nine in the uefa cup .
central midfielder stilian petrov will by joined by alan thompson , paul lambert , neil lennon and didier agathe , who strikes fear into the hearts of defenders with his scintillating pace down the wing .
robert douglas in goal will enjoy the protection of joos valgaeren , bobo balde and johann mjallby .
if o 'neill opts for a more defensive line-up , lambert may have to make way for jackie mcnamara .
two approaches to history the two coaches have adopted different approaches to the historical burden on their players ' shoulders .
martin o 'neill says his players will be full of pride as they walk out onto the pitch and remember the club 's most famous triumph in 1967 .
" the important thing is that we embrace the club 's history and not be frightened of it , " he said .
jose mourinho , on the other hand , told his players not to be overawed by the task of bringing home the club 's first european trophy in 16 years , saying " for this game , the players need to relax more and enjoy it . "
pitch " full of holes " that may be easier said than done .
mourinho has already complained about the state of the pitch , describing it as " very slow and full of holes . "
he even went so far as to say " the ball does n't roll in a straight line . "
the rough surface may prove more suited to celtic 's robust style of play than to that of the skillful portuguese .
porto odds-on although both sides have claimed high-profile scalps in this campaign , with porto knocking out lazio of rome and celtic disposing of liverpool en route to the final , most bookies have porto as odds-on favourites to lift the cup , with celtic at 2-1 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official uefa website official web site of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe , with links to all major competitions and clubs .

germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .
he stated that domestic protection was no longer the bundeswehr 's main concern . german defense minister peter struck presented his new policy guidelines to leaders in chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday , drawing criticism from within the government coalition of social democrats and greens as well as from opposition parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck it 's the first new set of government defense policy guidelines in 11 years .
they 're aimed at overhauling the bundeswehr and adapting it to its changing tasks in the modern world .
new priorities the defense ministry says the bundeswehr 's most important task nowadays is peacekeeping abroad , and national defense is no longer the priority - at least in times of peace .
the new guidelines also mark a shift in domestic security policy , as they give the army powers to assume roles in anti-terrorist operations within the country 's borders , in cases where the domestic security forces do not have the required capabilities .
previously , internal military operations were considered taboo considering the role played by the nazi-controlled machtwehr during world war ii .
the ministry also said the changes would involve bitter cutbacks in some areas , including the closures of several long-standing bases to free up money for international missions .
dispute over military service struck , a social democrat , will also renew his commitment to compulsory military service despite objections from the spd 's junior coalition partners , the green party .
the greens have been campaigning for the abolition of national service for years , and there is a clause in the coalition agreement to the effect that the issue will be addressed by the current government .
in an interview on german national television on wednesday , the greens ' defense policy spokesman , winfried nachtwei , said the minister 's new guidelines left the " ongoing conflict over military service unresolved . "
the opposition liberal free democrats also favor an end to conscription .
the party 's spokesman on defense issues , jörg van essen , described the new guidelines as " a step in the right direction . "
speaking during a radio interview broadcast nationwide , he said it was pointless to staff the armed forces with conscripts because , under current law , only volunteers can be sent to take part in overseas missions .
peace in the world while criticizing the minister 's policy on national service , the greens welcomed the overall thrust of the new policy guidelines .
nachtwei said they would allow the bundeswehr to make its contribution " to securing peace in the world and preventing conflicts . "
at the same time , he said , they would impose the necessary limits on its powers , by making sure it worked within the frameworks laid down by international law , the united nations , nato and the european union . anger over closures meanwhile , local and regional politicians reacted angrily to the announcement that about 10 army and air force bases staffing more than 7,000 troops are slated for shutdown .
the government says the closures will release up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- in funds for overseas missions .

the move represents a significant about-face for the company 's top executive , who has vehemently defended the new system , heralding it as more transparent , despite harsh criticism . effective immediately , one of the most oft-attacked elements - the high cancellation fees placed on early booking " plan & spar " -lrb- " plan and save " -rrb- tickets - is being reduced from € 45 to € 15 . mehdorn conceded that " the public 's fixation on the fees acted as a deterrent , impacting long-distance -lrb- travel -rrb- bookings on the whole . " new prices spark backlash mehdorn is yielding to public pressure , made all the worse by heavy losses in the first quarter of this year , when long-distance travel decreased by 6.1 percent , contributing to a loss of € 133 million .
for mehdorn , who had hoped to limit deutsche bahn 's losses to € 200 million this year and achieve profits of € 400 million as early as next year , the shift represented quite a setback . rail travelers simply did not accept the changes .
at a time when train travel faces increased competition from budget airlines , many can and did opt to take to the skies . high cancellation fees , the replacement of the much-loved " bahncard " -lrb- train card -rrb- - which used to allow customers to travel at a 50 percent discount - with a newer version that only offered 25 percent of the savings , and the increased cost of spontaneous travel - led to enormous price increases that fueled the consumer backlash .
tickets on some routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spontaneous , business and tourist travelers particularly hard . after the introduction of the new price system last december , the berlin-based german daily die tageszeitung famously called mehdorn the " rumsfeld of the rails . "
and editorials around the country called for his resignation .
federal transportation minister manfred stolpe of the ruling social democrats joined the chorus of critics , stating that " the new price system is not well designed and its implementation has not gone well . " more changes on the way there could be more changes by year 's end .
the rules governing the number of stops and overnight stays allowed with a " plan & spar " ticket may be relaxed , giving travelers a bit more flexibility . what 's more , restrictions dictating that part of a " plan & spar " journey take place over a weekend may be dropped . last but not least , the 50 percent rebate for " bahncard " travelers may return , should green party members , who have been supporting such a measure , be successful in pushing through their agenda . corporate casualities despite calls for his resignation , chairman mehdorn seems to have weathered the storm - at least for now .
his contract was extended tuesday through 2008 , and transportation minister stolpe expressed his support for the embattled executive : " mehdorn is the right man for the job . " some other top executives at the company have not fared so well .
the controversy over the price system claimed two : christoph franz , a member of the board of directors and head of passenger traffic , and hans gustav koch , head of marketing , were both forced to leave the company . should the changes not be enough to appease angered rail travelers , the entire price system may be scrapped .

the move represents a significant about-face for the company 's top executive , who has vehemently defended the new system , heralding it as more transparent , despite harsh criticism . effective immediately , one of the most oft-attacked elements - the high cancellation fees placed on early booking " plan & spar " -lrb- " plan and save " -rrb- tickets - is being reduced from € 45 to € 15 . mehdorn conceded that " the public 's fixation on the fees acted as a deterrent , impacting long-distance -lrb- travel -rrb- bookings on the whole . " new prices spark backlash mehdorn is yielding to public pressure , made all the worse by heavy losses in the first quarter of this year , when long-distance travel decreased by 6.1 percent , contributing to a loss of € 133 million .
for mehdorn , who had hoped to limit deutsche bahn 's losses to € 200 million this year and achieve profits of € 400 million as early as next year , the shift represented quite a setback . rail travelers simply did not accept the changes .
at a time when train travel faces increased competition from budget airlines , many can and did opt to take to the skies . high cancellation fees , the replacement of the much-loved " bahncard " -lrb- train card -rrb- - which used to allow customers to travel at a 50 percent discount - with a newer version that only offered 25 percent of the savings , and the increased cost of spontaneous travel - led to enormous price increases that fueled the consumer backlash .
tickets on some routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spontaneous , business and tourist travelers particularly hard . after the introduction of the new price system last december , the berlin-based german daily die tageszeitung famously called mehdorn the " rumsfeld of the rails . "
and editorials around the country called for his resignation .
federal transportation minister manfred stolpe of the ruling social democrats joined the chorus of critics , stating that " the new price system is not well designed and its implementation has not gone well . " more changes on the way there could be more changes by year 's end .
the rules governing the number of stops and overnight stays allowed with a " plan & spar " ticket may be relaxed , giving travelers a bit more flexibility . what 's more , restrictions dictating that part of a " plan & spar " journey take place over a weekend may be dropped . last but not least , the 50 percent rebate for " bahncard " travelers may return , should green party members , who have been supporting such a measure , be successful in pushing through their agenda . corporate casualities despite calls for his resignation , chairman mehdorn seems to have weathered the storm - at least for now .
his contract was extended tuesday through 2008 , and transportation minister stolpe expressed his support for the embattled executive : " mehdorn is the right man for the job . " some other top executives at the company have not fared so well .
the controversy over the price system claimed two : christoph franz , a member of the board of directors and head of passenger traffic , and hans gustav koch , head of marketing , were both forced to leave the company . should the changes not be enough to appease angered rail travelers , the entire price system may be scrapped .

the uefa cup final in seville on wednesday sees two clubs looking to reclaim their place among europe 's elite . two european clubs steeped in tradition will take to the field in seville 's estadio olímpico on wednesday night in the hopes of taking home the uefa cup and reclaiming their place among the continent 's soccer elite .
glasgow celtic 's last great triumph was when it won the european cup in 1967 .
fc porto won the same competition 20 years later , but has n't been in a european final since .
scottish invasion central seville was swamped in green and white on wednesday ahead of the match , as thousands of celtic fans kicked off their pre-match celebrations .

estimates range from 40,000 to 70,000 celtic supporters from glasgow and as far afield as the united states and australia .
most of the porto fans are expected to drive down just in time for the match .
porto injury-free porto coach jose mourinho has no serious injury worries .
he 's without suspended forward helder postiga , who was sent off in the semi-final , but midfielder francisco costinha has been declared fit again after he pulled a muscle in a domestic league match just over a week ago .

glasgow celtic 's last great triumph was when it won the european cup in 1967 .
fc porto won the same competition 20 years later , but has n't been in a european final since .
scottish invasion central seville was swamped in green and white on wednesday ahead of the match , as thousands of celtic fans kicked off their pre-match celebrations .
although the club was allocated only 15,000 tickets for the big game , thousands more are expected to arrive just for the party .
estimates range from 40,000 to 70,000 celtic supporters from glasgow and as far afield as the united states and australia .
most of the porto fans are expected to drive down just in time for the match .
porto injury-free porto coach jose mourinho has no serious injury worries .
he 's without suspended forward helder postiga , who was sent off in the semi-final , but midfielder francisco costinha has been declared fit again after he pulled a muscle in a domestic league match just over a week ago .
defender nuno valente , who was considered doubtful for the game , is also fit to line out .
mourinho is playing his cards close to his chest , and has yet to reveal who will partner derlei silva , the tournament 's top scorer with ten goals so far , up front .
he has a choice between edgaras jankauskas and nuno capucho , both of whom scored in saturday 's victory over varzim in the portuguese premier league .
he 's expected to use his standard back four of paolo ferreira , jorge costa , ricardo carvalho and valente .
as usual , vitor baia will be between the posts .
in midfield , costinha is likely to be joined by playmaker deco souza , maniche ribeiro and dmitri alenitchev .
hartson out for celtic celtic coach martin o 'neill will have to go without the services of striker john hartson , a key figure in their european campaign until now .
hartson has been ruled out due to a back injury .
but o 'neill can still count on a powerful strike force that includes chris sutton and henrik larsson , who has scored 28 league goals this season and nine in the uefa cup .
central midfielder stilian petrov will by joined by alan thompson , paul lambert , neil lennon and didier agathe , who strikes fear into the hearts of defenders with his scintillating pace down the wing .
robert douglas in goal will enjoy the protection of joos valgaeren , bobo balde and johann mjallby .
if o 'neill opts for a more defensive line-up , lambert may have to make way for jackie mcnamara .
two approaches to history the two coaches have adopted different approaches to the historical burden on their players ' shoulders .
martin o 'neill says his players will be full of pride as they walk out onto the pitch and remember the club 's most famous triumph in 1967 .
" the important thing is that we embrace the club 's history and not be frightened of it , " he said .
jose mourinho , on the other hand , told his players not to be overawed by the task of bringing home the club 's first european trophy in 16 years , saying " for this game , the players need to relax more and enjoy it . "
pitch " full of holes " that may be easier said than done .
mourinho has already complained about the state of the pitch , describing it as " very slow and full of holes . "
he even went so far as to say " the ball does n't roll in a straight line . "
the rough surface may prove more suited to celtic 's robust style of play than to that of the skillful portuguese .
porto odds-on although both sides have claimed high-profile scalps in this campaign , with porto knocking out lazio of rome and celtic disposing of liverpool en route to the final , most bookies have porto as odds-on favourites to lift the cup , with celtic at 2-1 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official uefa website official web site of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe , with links to all major competitions and clubs .

hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .
i 'm convinced it will take longer in europe , ” said kohler . “ while i think it ’ ll be ten to 20 years in iceland , i believe for europe itself it will take more like 20 , 30 , 40 years .
but making a start is important and learning from these experiences to then transfer them to europe . " but many problems still have to be solved before it gets that far .
a fuel cell-powered bus costs around six times as much as a diesel-run bus .
the cost of hydrogen power ca n't compete with gasoline or diesel , and a network of filling stations must still be built . one problem , above all , prevents fuel cell-powered motors from being employed in private cars : the fuel cells are temperature sensitive .

after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.05.2003 iceland aims for oil-free energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emission-free vehicles , like daimlerchrysler 's fuel cell-powered necar 5 , could be plying reykjavik 's streets in 10 to 20 years .
hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .
i 'm convinced it will take longer in europe , ” said kohler . “ while i think it ’ ll be ten to 20 years in iceland , i believe for europe itself it will take more like 20 , 30 , 40 years .
but making a start is important and learning from these experiences to then transfer them to europe . " but many problems still have to be solved before it gets that far .
a fuel cell-powered bus costs around six times as much as a diesel-run bus .
the cost of hydrogen power ca n't compete with gasoline or diesel , and a network of filling stations must still be built . one problem , above all , prevents fuel cell-powered motors from being employed in private cars : the fuel cells are temperature sensitive .
they are ruined when the water in their membranes freezes .
still daimlerchrysler 's engineers are optimistic about overcoming this hurdle .
and despite its frosty winters , iceland is convinced that hydrogen energy is on its way and oil is on its way out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's double-deckers to get hydrogen infusion germany 's capital city is working with volvo and a german fuel cell maker to replace its aging fleet of double-decker buses with new vehicles fueled by emission-free hydrogen .

the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .
i 'm convinced it will take longer in europe , ” said kohler . “ while i think it ’ ll be ten to 20 years in iceland , i believe for europe itself it will take more like 20 , 30 , 40 years .
but making a start is important and learning from these experiences to then transfer them to europe . " but many problems still have to be solved before it gets that far .
a fuel cell-powered bus costs around six times as much as a diesel-run bus .
the cost of hydrogen power ca n't compete with gasoline or diesel , and a network of filling stations must still be built . one problem , above all , prevents fuel cell-powered motors from being employed in private cars : the fuel cells are temperature sensitive .
they are ruined when the water in their membranes freezes .

after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.05.2003 deutsche bahn reforms new price system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with great fanfare deutsche bahn introduced its new price system last december following months of criticism and heavy losses , germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn , is rolling back some of the most controversial elements of the new price system - more changes are expected by year 's end . at a meeting of deutsche bahn 's board of directors on tuesday , chairman hartmut mehdorn gave in to pressure and announced changes to the controversial new pricing system ushered in last december .
the move represents a significant about-face for the company 's top executive , who has vehemently defended the new system , heralding it as more transparent , despite harsh criticism . effective immediately , one of the most oft-attacked elements - the high cancellation fees placed on early booking " plan & spar " -lrb- " plan and save " -rrb- tickets - is being reduced from € 45 to € 15 . mehdorn conceded that " the public 's fixation on the fees acted as a deterrent , impacting long-distance -lrb- travel -rrb- bookings on the whole . " new prices spark backlash mehdorn is yielding to public pressure , made all the worse by heavy losses in the first quarter of this year , when long-distance travel decreased by 6.1 percent , contributing to a loss of € 133 million .
for mehdorn , who had hoped to limit deutsche bahn 's losses to € 200 million this year and achieve profits of € 400 million as early as next year , the shift represented quite a setback . rail travelers simply did not accept the changes .
at a time when train travel faces increased competition from budget airlines , many can and did opt to take to the skies . high cancellation fees , the replacement of the much-loved " bahncard " -lrb- train card -rrb- - which used to allow customers to travel at a 50 percent discount - with a newer version that only offered 25 percent of the savings , and the increased cost of spontaneous travel - led to enormous price increases that fueled the consumer backlash .
tickets on some routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spontaneous , business and tourist travelers particularly hard . after the introduction of the new price system last december , the berlin-based german daily die tageszeitung famously called mehdorn the " rumsfeld of the rails . "
and editorials around the country called for his resignation .
federal transportation minister manfred stolpe of the ruling social democrats joined the chorus of critics , stating that " the new price system is not well designed and its implementation has not gone well . " more changes on the way there could be more changes by year 's end .
the rules governing the number of stops and overnight stays allowed with a " plan & spar " ticket may be relaxed , giving travelers a bit more flexibility . what 's more , restrictions dictating that part of a " plan & spar " journey take place over a weekend may be dropped . last but not least , the 50 percent rebate for " bahncard " travelers may return , should green party members , who have been supporting such a measure , be successful in pushing through their agenda . corporate casualities despite calls for his resignation , chairman mehdorn seems to have weathered the storm - at least for now .

germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .
he stated that domestic protection was no longer the bundeswehr 's main concern . german defense minister peter struck presented his new policy guidelines to leaders in chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday , drawing criticism from within the government coalition of social democrats and greens as well as from opposition parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck it 's the first new set of government defense policy guidelines in 11 years .
they 're aimed at overhauling the bundeswehr and adapting it to its changing tasks in the modern world .
new priorities the defense ministry says the bundeswehr 's most important task nowadays is peacekeeping abroad , and national defense is no longer the priority - at least in times of peace .
the new guidelines also mark a shift in domestic security policy , as they give the army powers to assume roles in anti-terrorist operations within the country 's borders , in cases where the domestic security forces do not have the required capabilities .
previously , internal military operations were considered taboo considering the role played by the nazi-controlled machtwehr during world war ii .
the ministry also said the changes would involve bitter cutbacks in some areas , including the closures of several long-standing bases to free up money for international missions .
dispute over military service struck , a social democrat , will also renew his commitment to compulsory military service despite objections from the spd 's junior coalition partners , the green party .
the greens have been campaigning for the abolition of national service for years , and there is a clause in the coalition agreement to the effect that the issue will be addressed by the current government .
in an interview on german national television on wednesday , the greens ' defense policy spokesman , winfried nachtwei , said the minister 's new guidelines left the " ongoing conflict over military service unresolved . "
the opposition liberal free democrats also favor an end to conscription .
the party 's spokesman on defense issues , jörg van essen , described the new guidelines as " a step in the right direction . "
speaking during a radio interview broadcast nationwide , he said it was pointless to staff the armed forces with conscripts because , under current law , only volunteers can be sent to take part in overseas missions .
peace in the world while criticizing the minister 's policy on national service , the greens welcomed the overall thrust of the new policy guidelines .
nachtwei said they would allow the bundeswehr to make its contribution " to securing peace in the world and preventing conflicts . "
at the same time , he said , they would impose the necessary limits on its powers , by making sure it worked within the frameworks laid down by international law , the united nations , nato and the european union . anger over closures meanwhile , local and regional politicians reacted angrily to the announcement that about 10 army and air force bases staffing more than 7,000 troops are slated for shutdown .
the government says the closures will release up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- in funds for overseas missions .
one of the bases slated for the chop is a tornado fighter jet base in upjever in the state of lower saxony .
state premier christian wulff , of the conservative christian democratic union , described the decision as " a blow to the coastal region . "
" all of central germany " without air defenses the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , said the planned closures would leave " all of central germany " without air defenses .
the party 's defense spokesman , christian schmidt , said the changing nature of the armed forces ' tasks meant that changes to the law were required , and not just to policy guidelines .
he also said the new guidelines failed to make clear how the minister intends to finance the bundeswehr 's new tasks with its current budget . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.05.2003 the flood gates of venice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water fills st. marks square , venice a watery jewel in italy 's gem-studded crown , venice is no stranger to the problems of high tides .
after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.05.2003 iceland aims for oil-free energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emission-free vehicles , like daimlerchrysler 's fuel cell-powered necar 5 , could be plying reykjavik 's streets in 10 to 20 years .
hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .

hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.05.2003 the flood gates of venice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : water fills st. marks square , venice a watery jewel in italy 's gem-studded crown , venice is no stranger to the problems of high tides .
after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

the uefa cup final in seville on wednesday sees two clubs looking to reclaim their place among europe 's elite . two european clubs steeped in tradition will take to the field in seville 's estadio olímpico on wednesday night in the hopes of taking home the uefa cup and reclaiming their place among the continent 's soccer elite .
glasgow celtic 's last great triumph was when it won the european cup in 1967 .
fc porto won the same competition 20 years later , but has n't been in a european final since .
scottish invasion central seville was swamped in green and white on wednesday ahead of the match , as thousands of celtic fans kicked off their pre-match celebrations .
although the club was allocated only 15,000 tickets for the big game , thousands more are expected to arrive just for the party .
estimates range from 40,000 to 70,000 celtic supporters from glasgow and as far afield as the united states and australia .
most of the porto fans are expected to drive down just in time for the match .
porto injury-free porto coach jose mourinho has no serious injury worries .
he 's without suspended forward helder postiga , who was sent off in the semi-final , but midfielder francisco costinha has been declared fit again after he pulled a muscle in a domestic league match just over a week ago .
defender nuno valente , who was considered doubtful for the game , is also fit to line out .
mourinho is playing his cards close to his chest , and has yet to reveal who will partner derlei silva , the tournament 's top scorer with ten goals so far , up front .
he has a choice between edgaras jankauskas and nuno capucho , both of whom scored in saturday 's victory over varzim in the portuguese premier league .
he 's expected to use his standard back four of paolo ferreira , jorge costa , ricardo carvalho and valente .
as usual , vitor baia will be between the posts .
in midfield , costinha is likely to be joined by playmaker deco souza , maniche ribeiro and dmitri alenitchev .
hartson out for celtic celtic coach martin o 'neill will have to go without the services of striker john hartson , a key figure in their european campaign until now .
hartson has been ruled out due to a back injury .
but o 'neill can still count on a powerful strike force that includes chris sutton and henrik larsson , who has scored 28 league goals this season and nine in the uefa cup .
central midfielder stilian petrov will by joined by alan thompson , paul lambert , neil lennon and didier agathe , who strikes fear into the hearts of defenders with his scintillating pace down the wing .
robert douglas in goal will enjoy the protection of joos valgaeren , bobo balde and johann mjallby .
if o 'neill opts for a more defensive line-up , lambert may have to make way for jackie mcnamara .
two approaches to history the two coaches have adopted different approaches to the historical burden on their players ' shoulders .
martin o 'neill says his players will be full of pride as they walk out onto the pitch and remember the club 's most famous triumph in 1967 .
" the important thing is that we embrace the club 's history and not be frightened of it , " he said .

the move represents a significant about-face for the company 's top executive , who has vehemently defended the new system , heralding it as more transparent , despite harsh criticism . effective immediately , one of the most oft-attacked elements - the high cancellation fees placed on early booking " plan & spar " -lrb- " plan and save " -rrb- tickets - is being reduced from € 45 to € 15 . mehdorn conceded that " the public 's fixation on the fees acted as a deterrent , impacting long-distance -lrb- travel -rrb- bookings on the whole . " new prices spark backlash mehdorn is yielding to public pressure , made all the worse by heavy losses in the first quarter of this year , when long-distance travel decreased by 6.1 percent , contributing to a loss of € 133 million .
for mehdorn , who had hoped to limit deutsche bahn 's losses to € 200 million this year and achieve profits of € 400 million as early as next year , the shift represented quite a setback . rail travelers simply did not accept the changes .
at a time when train travel faces increased competition from budget airlines , many can and did opt to take to the skies . high cancellation fees , the replacement of the much-loved " bahncard " -lrb- train card -rrb- - which used to allow customers to travel at a 50 percent discount - with a newer version that only offered 25 percent of the savings , and the increased cost of spontaneous travel - led to enormous price increases that fueled the consumer backlash .
tickets on some routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spontaneous , business and tourist travelers particularly hard . after the introduction of the new price system last december , the berlin-based german daily die tageszeitung famously called mehdorn the " rumsfeld of the rails . "
and editorials around the country called for his resignation .
federal transportation minister manfred stolpe of the ruling social democrats joined the chorus of critics , stating that " the new price system is not well designed and its implementation has not gone well . " more changes on the way there could be more changes by year 's end .
the rules governing the number of stops and overnight stays allowed with a " plan & spar " ticket may be relaxed , giving travelers a bit more flexibility . what 's more , restrictions dictating that part of a " plan & spar " journey take place over a weekend may be dropped . last but not least , the 50 percent rebate for " bahncard " travelers may return , should green party members , who have been supporting such a measure , be successful in pushing through their agenda . corporate casualities despite calls for his resignation , chairman mehdorn seems to have weathered the storm - at least for now .
his contract was extended tuesday through 2008 , and transportation minister stolpe expressed his support for the embattled executive : " mehdorn is the right man for the job . " some other top executives at the company have not fared so well .
the controversy over the price system claimed two : christoph franz , a member of the board of directors and head of passenger traffic , and hans gustav koch , head of marketing , were both forced to leave the company . should the changes not be enough to appease angered rail travelers , the entire price system may be scrapped .
and more changes among deutsche bahn 's top brass may follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism of new german train fares grows politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .

germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .
he stated that domestic protection was no longer the bundeswehr 's main concern . german defense minister peter struck presented his new policy guidelines to leaders in chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday , drawing criticism from within the government coalition of social democrats and greens as well as from opposition parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck it 's the first new set of government defense policy guidelines in 11 years .
they 're aimed at overhauling the bundeswehr and adapting it to its changing tasks in the modern world .
new priorities the defense ministry says the bundeswehr 's most important task nowadays is peacekeeping abroad , and national defense is no longer the priority - at least in times of peace .
the new guidelines also mark a shift in domestic security policy , as they give the army powers to assume roles in anti-terrorist operations within the country 's borders , in cases where the domestic security forces do not have the required capabilities .
previously , internal military operations were considered taboo considering the role played by the nazi-controlled machtwehr during world war ii .
the ministry also said the changes would involve bitter cutbacks in some areas , including the closures of several long-standing bases to free up money for international missions .
dispute over military service struck , a social democrat , will also renew his commitment to compulsory military service despite objections from the spd 's junior coalition partners , the green party .
the greens have been campaigning for the abolition of national service for years , and there is a clause in the coalition agreement to the effect that the issue will be addressed by the current government .
in an interview on german national television on wednesday , the greens ' defense policy spokesman , winfried nachtwei , said the minister 's new guidelines left the " ongoing conflict over military service unresolved . "
the opposition liberal free democrats also favor an end to conscription .
the party 's spokesman on defense issues , jörg van essen , described the new guidelines as " a step in the right direction . "
speaking during a radio interview broadcast nationwide , he said it was pointless to staff the armed forces with conscripts because , under current law , only volunteers can be sent to take part in overseas missions .
peace in the world while criticizing the minister 's policy on national service , the greens welcomed the overall thrust of the new policy guidelines .
nachtwei said they would allow the bundeswehr to make its contribution " to securing peace in the world and preventing conflicts . "
at the same time , he said , they would impose the necessary limits on its powers , by making sure it worked within the frameworks laid down by international law , the united nations , nato and the european union . anger over closures meanwhile , local and regional politicians reacted angrily to the announcement that about 10 army and air force bases staffing more than 7,000 troops are slated for shutdown .
the government says the closures will release up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- in funds for overseas missions .
one of the bases slated for the chop is a tornado fighter jet base in upjever in the state of lower saxony .
state premier christian wulff , of the conservative christian democratic union , described the decision as " a blow to the coastal region . "
" all of central germany " without air defenses the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , said the planned closures would leave " all of central germany " without air defenses .
the party 's defense spokesman , christian schmidt , said the changing nature of the armed forces ' tasks meant that changes to the law were required , and not just to policy guidelines .
he also said the new guidelines failed to make clear how the minister intends to finance the bundeswehr 's new tasks with its current budget . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

they 're aimed at overhauling the bundeswehr and adapting it to its changing tasks in the modern world .
new priorities the defense ministry says the bundeswehr 's most important task nowadays is peacekeeping abroad , and national defense is no longer the priority - at least in times of peace .
the new guidelines also mark a shift in domestic security policy , as they give the army powers to assume roles in anti-terrorist operations within the country 's borders , in cases where the domestic security forces do not have the required capabilities .
previously , internal military operations were considered taboo considering the role played by the nazi-controlled machtwehr during world war ii .

the move represents a significant about-face for the company 's top executive , who has vehemently defended the new system , heralding it as more transparent , despite harsh criticism . effective immediately , one of the most oft-attacked elements - the high cancellation fees placed on early booking " plan & spar " -lrb- " plan and save " -rrb- tickets - is being reduced from € 45 to € 15 . mehdorn conceded that " the public 's fixation on the fees acted as a deterrent , impacting long-distance -lrb- travel -rrb- bookings on the whole .

the uefa cup final in seville on wednesday sees two clubs looking to reclaim their place among europe 's elite . two european clubs steeped in tradition will take to the field in seville 's estadio olímpico on wednesday night in the hopes of taking home the uefa cup and reclaiming their place among the continent 's soccer elite .
glasgow celtic 's last great triumph was when it won the european cup in 1967 .
fc porto won the same competition 20 years later , but has n't been in a european final since .
scottish invasion central seville was swamped in green and white on wednesday ahead of the match , as thousands of celtic fans kicked off their pre-match celebrations .
although the club was allocated only 15,000 tickets for the big game , thousands more are expected to arrive just for the party .
estimates range from 40,000 to 70,000 celtic supporters from glasgow and as far afield as the united states and australia .
most of the porto fans are expected to drive down just in time for the match .
porto injury-free porto coach jose mourinho has no serious injury worries .
he 's without suspended forward helder postiga , who was sent off in the semi-final , but midfielder francisco costinha has been declared fit again after he pulled a muscle in a domestic league match just over a week ago .
defender nuno valente , who was considered doubtful for the game , is also fit to line out .
mourinho is playing his cards close to his chest , and has yet to reveal who will partner derlei silva , the tournament 's top scorer with ten goals so far , up front .
he has a choice between edgaras jankauskas and nuno capucho , both of whom scored in saturday 's victory over varzim in the portuguese premier league .
he 's expected to use his standard back four of paolo ferreira , jorge costa , ricardo carvalho and valente .
as usual , vitor baia will be between the posts .
in midfield , costinha is likely to be joined by playmaker deco souza , maniche ribeiro and dmitri alenitchev .
hartson out for celtic celtic coach martin o 'neill will have to go without the services of striker john hartson , a key figure in their european campaign until now .
hartson has been ruled out due to a back injury .
but o 'neill can still count on a powerful strike force that includes chris sutton and henrik larsson , who has scored 28 league goals this season and nine in the uefa cup .
central midfielder stilian petrov will by joined by alan thompson , paul lambert , neil lennon and didier agathe , who strikes fear into the hearts of defenders with his scintillating pace down the wing .
robert douglas in goal will enjoy the protection of joos valgaeren , bobo balde and johann mjallby .
if o 'neill opts for a more defensive line-up , lambert may have to make way for jackie mcnamara .
two approaches to history the two coaches have adopted different approaches to the historical burden on their players ' shoulders .
martin o 'neill says his players will be full of pride as they walk out onto the pitch and remember the club 's most famous triumph in 1967 .
" the important thing is that we embrace the club 's history and not be frightened of it , " he said .
jose mourinho , on the other hand , told his players not to be overawed by the task of bringing home the club 's first european trophy in 16 years , saying " for this game , the players need to relax more and enjoy it . "
pitch " full of holes " that may be easier said than done .
mourinho has already complained about the state of the pitch , describing it as " very slow and full of holes . "
he even went so far as to say " the ball does n't roll in a straight line . "
the rough surface may prove more suited to celtic 's robust style of play than to that of the skillful portuguese .
porto odds-on although both sides have claimed high-profile scalps in this campaign , with porto knocking out lazio of rome and celtic disposing of liverpool en route to the final , most bookies have porto as odds-on favourites to lift the cup , with celtic at 2-1 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links the official uefa website official web site of uefa , soccer 's governing body in europe , with links to all major competitions and clubs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.05.2003 iceland aims for oil-free energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emission-free vehicles , like daimlerchrysler 's fuel cell-powered necar 5 , could be plying reykjavik 's streets in 10 to 20 years .
hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .
i 'm convinced it will take longer in europe , ” said kohler . “ while i think it ’ ll be ten to 20 years in iceland , i believe for europe itself it will take more like 20 , 30 , 40 years .
but making a start is important and learning from these experiences to then transfer them to europe . " but many problems still have to be solved before it gets that far .
a fuel cell-powered bus costs around six times as much as a diesel-run bus .
the cost of hydrogen power ca n't compete with gasoline or diesel , and a network of filling stations must still be built . one problem , above all , prevents fuel cell-powered motors from being employed in private cars : the fuel cells are temperature sensitive .

hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .
i 'm convinced it will take longer in europe , ” said kohler . “ while i think it ’ ll be ten to 20 years in iceland , i believe for europe itself it will take more like 20 , 30 , 40 years .
but making a start is important and learning from these experiences to then transfer them to europe . " but many problems still have to be solved before it gets that far .
a fuel cell-powered bus costs around six times as much as a diesel-run bus .
the cost of hydrogen power ca n't compete with gasoline or diesel , and a network of filling stations must still be built . one problem , above all , prevents fuel cell-powered motors from being employed in private cars : the fuel cells are temperature sensitive .

after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

german shops aren ’ t normally known for being in the vanguard of global retailing .
but the country ’ s largest retailer , metro , is hoping to change things with a new supermarket of the future filled with techno gadgets . it ’ s a common complaint of many visitors to germany : miserable service and surly store clerks often make shopping an altogether unpleasant experience .
metro ’ s new “ future store ” supermarket in rheinberg near düsseldorf gets around such cranky cashier problems by eliminating the cashier entirely . shoppers at the store ’ s grand opening earlier this week - including german supermodel claudia schiffer - instead simply made use of an automatic checkout where prices are transmitted to a computer via special price tags .
and the computerized cashier is but one of the many new retailing technologies that the future store , an adapted outlet of the extra grocery store chain , is supposed to both showcase and test . fruits and vegetables are recognized by digital cameras as they are weighed and the shopping cart is guided by a navigation system that can direct shoppers to past favorite purchases . “ i ’ ve never seen anything like it , it ’ s so exciting , ” gushed schiffer .
“ for me shopping has to go quickly , because i don ’ t have a lot of time .
here there aren ’ t any of those long lines that i hate . ” life-sized petri dish besides making life easier for harried supermodels , the future store will serve as a life-sized technology petri dish for metro and over 40 other companies , including u.s. chipmaker intel and german software giant sap . while some shoppers may cherish having a cart that keeps you from getting lost in the frozen foods section , at the heart of the store are special price tags with rfid -lrb- radio frequency identification -rrb- chips embedded . the tags on more than 37,000 items transmit the price of the products wirelessly to the computerized checkout as shoppers pass through the cashier area , which then automatically deducts the purchase from the customer 's bank or store account .
the system will also allow stores to micro-manage inventory , such as making sure all shelves remain filled . although metro ceo hans-joachim körber admitted most of the store ’ s high-tech gadgets wouldn ’ t go into mass use for the next five to ten years , he remained sanguine the investment would eventually pay off . “ whoever is first with all this will also be the first to profit from it .
at the end of the day these technologies will be worth it , there ’ s no doubt about that , ” körber said . now germany will just have to figure out a way to automate those gruff public servants . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law to extend german shop hours passes last hurdle starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays .

germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .
he stated that domestic protection was no longer the bundeswehr 's main concern . german defense minister peter struck presented his new policy guidelines to leaders in chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday , drawing criticism from within the government coalition of social democrats and greens as well as from opposition parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck it 's the first new set of government defense policy guidelines in 11 years .
they 're aimed at overhauling the bundeswehr and adapting it to its changing tasks in the modern world .
new priorities the defense ministry says the bundeswehr 's most important task nowadays is peacekeeping abroad , and national defense is no longer the priority - at least in times of peace .
the new guidelines also mark a shift in domestic security policy , as they give the army powers to assume roles in anti-terrorist operations within the country 's borders , in cases where the domestic security forces do not have the required capabilities .
previously , internal military operations were considered taboo considering the role played by the nazi-controlled machtwehr during world war ii .
the ministry also said the changes would involve bitter cutbacks in some areas , including the closures of several long-standing bases to free up money for international missions .
dispute over military service struck , a social democrat , will also renew his commitment to compulsory military service despite objections from the spd 's junior coalition partners , the green party .
the greens have been campaigning for the abolition of national service for years , and there is a clause in the coalition agreement to the effect that the issue will be addressed by the current government .
in an interview on german national television on wednesday , the greens ' defense policy spokesman , winfried nachtwei , said the minister 's new guidelines left the " ongoing conflict over military service unresolved . "
the opposition liberal free democrats also favor an end to conscription .
the party 's spokesman on defense issues , jörg van essen , described the new guidelines as " a step in the right direction . "
speaking during a radio interview broadcast nationwide , he said it was pointless to staff the armed forces with conscripts because , under current law , only volunteers can be sent to take part in overseas missions .
peace in the world while criticizing the minister 's policy on national service , the greens welcomed the overall thrust of the new policy guidelines .
nachtwei said they would allow the bundeswehr to make its contribution " to securing peace in the world and preventing conflicts . "
at the same time , he said , they would impose the necessary limits on its powers , by making sure it worked within the frameworks laid down by international law , the united nations , nato and the european union . anger over closures meanwhile , local and regional politicians reacted angrily to the announcement that about 10 army and air force bases staffing more than 7,000 troops are slated for shutdown .
the government says the closures will release up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- in funds for overseas missions .
one of the bases slated for the chop is a tornado fighter jet base in upjever in the state of lower saxony .
state premier christian wulff , of the conservative christian democratic union , described the decision as " a blow to the coastal region . "
" all of central germany " without air defenses the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , said the planned closures would leave " all of central germany " without air defenses .
the party 's defense spokesman , christian schmidt , said the changing nature of the armed forces ' tasks meant that changes to the law were required , and not just to policy guidelines .
he also said the new guidelines failed to make clear how the minister intends to finance the bundeswehr 's new tasks with its current budget . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .
i 'm convinced it will take longer in europe , ” said kohler . “ while i think it ’ ll be ten to 20 years in iceland , i believe for europe itself it will take more like 20 , 30 , 40 years .
but making a start is important and learning from these experiences to then transfer them to europe . " but many problems still have to be solved before it gets that far .
a fuel cell-powered bus costs around six times as much as a diesel-run bus .
the cost of hydrogen power ca n't compete with gasoline or diesel , and a network of filling stations must still be built . one problem , above all , prevents fuel cell-powered motors from being employed in private cars : the fuel cells are temperature sensitive .
they are ruined when the water in their membranes freezes .
still daimlerchrysler 's engineers are optimistic about overcoming this hurdle .
and despite its frosty winters , iceland is convinced that hydrogen energy is on its way and oil is on its way out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's double-deckers to get hydrogen infusion germany 's capital city is working with volvo and a german fuel cell maker to replace its aging fleet of double-decker buses with new vehicles fueled by emission-free hydrogen .

germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .
he stated that domestic protection was no longer the bundeswehr 's main concern . german defense minister peter struck presented his new policy guidelines to leaders in chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday , drawing criticism from within the government coalition of social democrats and greens as well as from opposition parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck it 's the first new set of government defense policy guidelines in 11 years .
they 're aimed at overhauling the bundeswehr and adapting it to its changing tasks in the modern world .
new priorities the defense ministry says the bundeswehr 's most important task nowadays is peacekeeping abroad , and national defense is no longer the priority - at least in times of peace .
the new guidelines also mark a shift in domestic security policy , as they give the army powers to assume roles in anti-terrorist operations within the country 's borders , in cases where the domestic security forces do not have the required capabilities .
previously , internal military operations were considered taboo considering the role played by the nazi-controlled machtwehr during world war ii .
the ministry also said the changes would involve bitter cutbacks in some areas , including the closures of several long-standing bases to free up money for international missions .
dispute over military service struck , a social democrat , will also renew his commitment to compulsory military service despite objections from the spd 's junior coalition partners , the green party .
the greens have been campaigning for the abolition of national service for years , and there is a clause in the coalition agreement to the effect that the issue will be addressed by the current government .
in an interview on german national television on wednesday , the greens ' defense policy spokesman , winfried nachtwei , said the minister 's new guidelines left the " ongoing conflict over military service unresolved . "
the opposition liberal free democrats also favor an end to conscription .
the party 's spokesman on defense issues , jörg van essen , described the new guidelines as " a step in the right direction . "
speaking during a radio interview broadcast nationwide , he said it was pointless to staff the armed forces with conscripts because , under current law , only volunteers can be sent to take part in overseas missions .
peace in the world while criticizing the minister 's policy on national service , the greens welcomed the overall thrust of the new policy guidelines .
nachtwei said they would allow the bundeswehr to make its contribution " to securing peace in the world and preventing conflicts . "
at the same time , he said , they would impose the necessary limits on its powers , by making sure it worked within the frameworks laid down by international law , the united nations , nato and the european union . anger over closures meanwhile , local and regional politicians reacted angrily to the announcement that about 10 army and air force bases staffing more than 7,000 troops are slated for shutdown .
the government says the closures will release up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- in funds for overseas missions .
one of the bases slated for the chop is a tornado fighter jet base in upjever in the state of lower saxony .
state premier christian wulff , of the conservative christian democratic union , described the decision as " a blow to the coastal region . "
" all of central germany " without air defenses the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , said the planned closures would leave " all of central germany " without air defenses .
the party 's defense spokesman , christian schmidt , said the changing nature of the armed forces ' tasks meant that changes to the law were required , and not just to policy guidelines .
he also said the new guidelines failed to make clear how the minister intends to finance the bundeswehr 's new tasks with its current budget . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.05.2003 deutsche bahn reforms new price system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with great fanfare deutsche bahn introduced its new price system last december following months of criticism and heavy losses , germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn , is rolling back some of the most controversial elements of the new price system - more changes are expected by year 's end . at a meeting of deutsche bahn 's board of directors on tuesday , chairman hartmut mehdorn gave in to pressure and announced changes to the controversial new pricing system ushered in last december .
the move represents a significant about-face for the company 's top executive , who has vehemently defended the new system , heralding it as more transparent , despite harsh criticism . effective immediately , one of the most oft-attacked elements - the high cancellation fees placed on early booking " plan & spar " -lrb- " plan and save " -rrb- tickets - is being reduced from € 45 to € 15 . mehdorn conceded that " the public 's fixation on the fees acted as a deterrent , impacting long-distance -lrb- travel -rrb- bookings on the whole . " new prices spark backlash mehdorn is yielding to public pressure , made all the worse by heavy losses in the first quarter of this year , when long-distance travel decreased by 6.1 percent , contributing to a loss of € 133 million .
for mehdorn , who had hoped to limit deutsche bahn 's losses to € 200 million this year and achieve profits of € 400 million as early as next year , the shift represented quite a setback . rail travelers simply did not accept the changes .
at a time when train travel faces increased competition from budget airlines , many can and did opt to take to the skies . high cancellation fees , the replacement of the much-loved " bahncard " -lrb- train card -rrb- - which used to allow customers to travel at a 50 percent discount - with a newer version that only offered 25 percent of the savings , and the increased cost of spontaneous travel - led to enormous price increases that fueled the consumer backlash .
tickets on some routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spontaneous , business and tourist travelers particularly hard . after the introduction of the new price system last december , the berlin-based german daily die tageszeitung famously called mehdorn the " rumsfeld of the rails . "
and editorials around the country called for his resignation .
federal transportation minister manfred stolpe of the ruling social democrats joined the chorus of critics , stating that " the new price system is not well designed and its implementation has not gone well . " more changes on the way there could be more changes by year 's end .
the rules governing the number of stops and overnight stays allowed with a " plan & spar " ticket may be relaxed , giving travelers a bit more flexibility . what 's more , restrictions dictating that part of a " plan & spar " journey take place over a weekend may be dropped . last but not least , the 50 percent rebate for " bahncard " travelers may return , should green party members , who have been supporting such a measure , be successful in pushing through their agenda . corporate casualities despite calls for his resignation , chairman mehdorn seems to have weathered the storm - at least for now .
his contract was extended tuesday through 2008 , and transportation minister stolpe expressed his support for the embattled executive : " mehdorn is the right man for the job . " some other top executives at the company have not fared so well .
the controversy over the price system claimed two : christoph franz , a member of the board of directors and head of passenger traffic , and hans gustav koch , head of marketing , were both forced to leave the company . should the changes not be enough to appease angered rail travelers , the entire price system may be scrapped .
and more changes among deutsche bahn 's top brass may follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism of new german train fares grows politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .

german shops aren ’ t normally known for being in the vanguard of global retailing .
but the country ’ s largest retailer , metro , is hoping to change things with a new supermarket of the future filled with techno gadgets . it ’ s a common complaint of many visitors to germany : miserable service and surly store clerks often make shopping an altogether unpleasant experience .
metro ’ s new “ future store ” supermarket in rheinberg near düsseldorf gets around such cranky cashier problems by eliminating the cashier entirely . shoppers at the store ’ s grand opening earlier this week - including german supermodel claudia schiffer - instead simply made use of an automatic checkout where prices are transmitted to a computer via special price tags .
and the computerized cashier is but one of the many new retailing technologies that the future store , an adapted outlet of the extra grocery store chain , is supposed to both showcase and test . fruits and vegetables are recognized by digital cameras as they are weighed and the shopping cart is guided by a navigation system that can direct shoppers to past favorite purchases . “ i ’ ve never seen anything like it , it ’ s so exciting , ” gushed schiffer .
“ for me shopping has to go quickly , because i don ’ t have a lot of time .
here there aren ’ t any of those long lines that i hate . ” life-sized petri dish besides making life easier for harried supermodels , the future store will serve as a life-sized technology petri dish for metro and over 40 other companies , including u.s. chipmaker intel and german software giant sap . while some shoppers may cherish having a cart that keeps you from getting lost in the frozen foods section , at the heart of the store are special price tags with rfid -lrb- radio frequency identification -rrb- chips embedded . the tags on more than 37,000 items transmit the price of the products wirelessly to the computerized checkout as shoppers pass through the cashier area , which then automatically deducts the purchase from the customer 's bank or store account .
the system will also allow stores to micro-manage inventory , such as making sure all shelves remain filled . although metro ceo hans-joachim körber admitted most of the store ’ s high-tech gadgets wouldn ’ t go into mass use for the next five to ten years , he remained sanguine the investment would eventually pay off . “ whoever is first with all this will also be the first to profit from it .
at the end of the day these technologies will be worth it , there ’ s no doubt about that , ” körber said . now germany will just have to figure out a way to automate those gruff public servants . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de law to extend german shop hours passes last hurdle starting this summer , german consumers will get a few extra hours to shop now that the upper house of parliament passed a new law allowing stores to stay open longer on saturdays .

germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .
he stated that domestic protection was no longer the bundeswehr 's main concern . german defense minister peter struck presented his new policy guidelines to leaders in chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday , drawing criticism from within the government coalition of social democrats and greens as well as from opposition parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck it 's the first new set of government defense policy guidelines in 11 years .
they 're aimed at overhauling the bundeswehr and adapting it to its changing tasks in the modern world .
new priorities the defense ministry says the bundeswehr 's most important task nowadays is peacekeeping abroad , and national defense is no longer the priority - at least in times of peace .
the new guidelines also mark a shift in domestic security policy , as they give the army powers to assume roles in anti-terrorist operations within the country 's borders , in cases where the domestic security forces do not have the required capabilities .
previously , internal military operations were considered taboo considering the role played by the nazi-controlled machtwehr during world war ii .
the ministry also said the changes would involve bitter cutbacks in some areas , including the closures of several long-standing bases to free up money for international missions .
dispute over military service struck , a social democrat , will also renew his commitment to compulsory military service despite objections from the spd 's junior coalition partners , the green party .
the greens have been campaigning for the abolition of national service for years , and there is a clause in the coalition agreement to the effect that the issue will be addressed by the current government .
in an interview on german national television on wednesday , the greens ' defense policy spokesman , winfried nachtwei , said the minister 's new guidelines left the " ongoing conflict over military service unresolved . "
the opposition liberal free democrats also favor an end to conscription .
the party 's spokesman on defense issues , jörg van essen , described the new guidelines as " a step in the right direction . "
speaking during a radio interview broadcast nationwide , he said it was pointless to staff the armed forces with conscripts because , under current law , only volunteers can be sent to take part in overseas missions .
peace in the world while criticizing the minister 's policy on national service , the greens welcomed the overall thrust of the new policy guidelines .
nachtwei said they would allow the bundeswehr to make its contribution " to securing peace in the world and preventing conflicts . "
at the same time , he said , they would impose the necessary limits on its powers , by making sure it worked within the frameworks laid down by international law , the united nations , nato and the european union . anger over closures meanwhile , local and regional politicians reacted angrily to the announcement that about 10 army and air force bases staffing more than 7,000 troops are slated for shutdown .
the government says the closures will release up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- in funds for overseas missions .
one of the bases slated for the chop is a tornado fighter jet base in upjever in the state of lower saxony .
state premier christian wulff , of the conservative christian democratic union , described the decision as " a blow to the coastal region . "
" all of central germany " without air defenses the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , said the planned closures would leave " all of central germany " without air defenses .
the party 's defense spokesman , christian schmidt , said the changing nature of the armed forces ' tasks meant that changes to the law were required , and not just to policy guidelines .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.05.2003 deutsche bahn reforms new price system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with great fanfare deutsche bahn introduced its new price system last december following months of criticism and heavy losses , germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn , is rolling back some of the most controversial elements of the new price system - more changes are expected by year 's end . at a meeting of deutsche bahn 's board of directors on tuesday , chairman hartmut mehdorn gave in to pressure and announced changes to the controversial new pricing system ushered in last december .
the move represents a significant about-face for the company 's top executive , who has vehemently defended the new system , heralding it as more transparent , despite harsh criticism . effective immediately , one of the most oft-attacked elements - the high cancellation fees placed on early booking " plan & spar " -lrb- " plan and save " -rrb- tickets - is being reduced from € 45 to € 15 . mehdorn conceded that " the public 's fixation on the fees acted as a deterrent , impacting long-distance -lrb- travel -rrb- bookings on the whole . " new prices spark backlash mehdorn is yielding to public pressure , made all the worse by heavy losses in the first quarter of this year , when long-distance travel decreased by 6.1 percent , contributing to a loss of € 133 million .
for mehdorn , who had hoped to limit deutsche bahn 's losses to € 200 million this year and achieve profits of € 400 million as early as next year , the shift represented quite a setback . rail travelers simply did not accept the changes .
at a time when train travel faces increased competition from budget airlines , many can and did opt to take to the skies . high cancellation fees , the replacement of the much-loved " bahncard " -lrb- train card -rrb- - which used to allow customers to travel at a 50 percent discount - with a newer version that only offered 25 percent of the savings , and the increased cost of spontaneous travel - led to enormous price increases that fueled the consumer backlash .
tickets on some routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spontaneous , business and tourist travelers particularly hard . after the introduction of the new price system last december , the berlin-based german daily die tageszeitung famously called mehdorn the " rumsfeld of the rails .

the move represents a significant about-face for the company 's top executive , who has vehemently defended the new system , heralding it as more transparent , despite harsh criticism . effective immediately , one of the most oft-attacked elements - the high cancellation fees placed on early booking " plan & spar " -lrb- " plan and save " -rrb- tickets - is being reduced from € 45 to € 15 . mehdorn conceded that " the public 's fixation on the fees acted as a deterrent , impacting long-distance -lrb- travel -rrb- bookings on the whole . " new prices spark backlash mehdorn is yielding to public pressure , made all the worse by heavy losses in the first quarter of this year , when long-distance travel decreased by 6.1 percent , contributing to a loss of € 133 million .
for mehdorn , who had hoped to limit deutsche bahn 's losses to € 200 million this year and achieve profits of € 400 million as early as next year , the shift represented quite a setback . rail travelers simply did not accept the changes .

tickets on some routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spontaneous , business and tourist travelers particularly hard . after the introduction of the new price system last december , the berlin-based german daily die tageszeitung famously called mehdorn the " rumsfeld of the rails .

the move represents a significant about-face for the company 's top executive , who has vehemently defended the new system , heralding it as more transparent , despite harsh criticism . effective immediately , one of the most oft-attacked elements - the high cancellation fees placed on early booking " plan & spar " -lrb- " plan and save " -rrb- tickets - is being reduced from € 45 to € 15 . mehdorn conceded that " the public 's fixation on the fees acted as a deterrent , impacting long-distance -lrb- travel -rrb- bookings on the whole . " new prices spark backlash mehdorn is yielding to public pressure , made all the worse by heavy losses in the first quarter of this year , when long-distance travel decreased by 6.1 percent , contributing to a loss of € 133 million .
for mehdorn , who had hoped to limit deutsche bahn 's losses to € 200 million this year and achieve profits of € 400 million as early as next year , the shift represented quite a setback . rail travelers simply did not accept the changes .
at a time when train travel faces increased competition from budget airlines , many can and did opt to take to the skies . high cancellation fees , the replacement of the much-loved " bahncard " -lrb- train card -rrb- - which used to allow customers to travel at a 50 percent discount - with a newer version that only offered 25 percent of the savings , and the increased cost of spontaneous travel - led to enormous price increases that fueled the consumer backlash .
tickets on some routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spontaneous , business and tourist travelers particularly hard . after the introduction of the new price system last december , the berlin-based german daily die tageszeitung famously called mehdorn the " rumsfeld of the rails . "
and editorials around the country called for his resignation .
federal transportation minister manfred stolpe of the ruling social democrats joined the chorus of critics , stating that " the new price system is not well designed and its implementation has not gone well . " more changes on the way there could be more changes by year 's end .
the rules governing the number of stops and overnight stays allowed with a " plan & spar " ticket may be relaxed , giving travelers a bit more flexibility . what 's more , restrictions dictating that part of a " plan & spar " journey take place over a weekend may be dropped . last but not least , the 50 percent rebate for " bahncard " travelers may return , should green party members , who have been supporting such a measure , be successful in pushing through their agenda . corporate casualities despite calls for his resignation , chairman mehdorn seems to have weathered the storm - at least for now .

glasgow celtic 's last great triumph was when it won the european cup in 1967 .

the uefa cup final in seville on wednesday sees two clubs looking to reclaim their place among europe 's elite . two european clubs steeped in tradition will take to the field in seville 's estadio olímpico on wednesday night in the hopes of taking home the uefa cup and reclaiming their place among the continent 's soccer elite .
glasgow celtic 's last great triumph was when it won the european cup in 1967 .
fc porto won the same competition 20 years later , but has n't been in a european final since .
scottish invasion central seville was swamped in green and white on wednesday ahead of the match , as thousands of celtic fans kicked off their pre-match celebrations .
although the club was allocated only 15,000 tickets for the big game , thousands more are expected to arrive just for the party .
estimates range from 40,000 to 70,000 celtic supporters from glasgow and as far afield as the united states and australia .
most of the porto fans are expected to drive down just in time for the match .
porto injury-free porto coach jose mourinho has no serious injury worries .
he 's without suspended forward helder postiga , who was sent off in the semi-final , but midfielder francisco costinha has been declared fit again after he pulled a muscle in a domestic league match just over a week ago .
defender nuno valente , who was considered doubtful for the game , is also fit to line out .
mourinho is playing his cards close to his chest , and has yet to reveal who will partner derlei silva , the tournament 's top scorer with ten goals so far , up front .
he has a choice between edgaras jankauskas and nuno capucho , both of whom scored in saturday 's victory over varzim in the portuguese premier league .
he 's expected to use his standard back four of paolo ferreira , jorge costa , ricardo carvalho and valente .
as usual , vitor baia will be between the posts .
in midfield , costinha is likely to be joined by playmaker deco souza , maniche ribeiro and dmitri alenitchev .
hartson out for celtic celtic coach martin o 'neill will have to go without the services of striker john hartson , a key figure in their european campaign until now .
hartson has been ruled out due to a back injury .
but o 'neill can still count on a powerful strike force that includes chris sutton and henrik larsson , who has scored 28 league goals this season and nine in the uefa cup .
central midfielder stilian petrov will by joined by alan thompson , paul lambert , neil lennon and didier agathe , who strikes fear into the hearts of defenders with his scintillating pace down the wing .
robert douglas in goal will enjoy the protection of joos valgaeren , bobo balde and johann mjallby .
if o 'neill opts for a more defensive line-up , lambert may have to make way for jackie mcnamara .
two approaches to history the two coaches have adopted different approaches to the historical burden on their players ' shoulders .
martin o 'neill says his players will be full of pride as they walk out onto the pitch and remember the club 's most famous triumph in 1967 .
" the important thing is that we embrace the club 's history and not be frightened of it , " he said .
jose mourinho , on the other hand , told his players not to be overawed by the task of bringing home the club 's first european trophy in 16 years , saying " for this game , the players need to relax more and enjoy it . "

germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .
he stated that domestic protection was no longer the bundeswehr 's main concern . german defense minister peter struck presented his new policy guidelines to leaders in chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday , drawing criticism from within the government coalition of social democrats and greens as well as from opposition parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck it 's the first new set of government defense policy guidelines in 11 years .
they 're aimed at overhauling the bundeswehr and adapting it to its changing tasks in the modern world .
new priorities the defense ministry says the bundeswehr 's most important task nowadays is peacekeeping abroad , and national defense is no longer the priority - at least in times of peace .
the new guidelines also mark a shift in domestic security policy , as they give the army powers to assume roles in anti-terrorist operations within the country 's borders , in cases where the domestic security forces do not have the required capabilities .
previously , internal military operations were considered taboo considering the role played by the nazi-controlled machtwehr during world war ii .
the ministry also said the changes would involve bitter cutbacks in some areas , including the closures of several long-standing bases to free up money for international missions .
dispute over military service struck , a social democrat , will also renew his commitment to compulsory military service despite objections from the spd 's junior coalition partners , the green party .
the greens have been campaigning for the abolition of national service for years , and there is a clause in the coalition agreement to the effect that the issue will be addressed by the current government .
in an interview on german national television on wednesday , the greens ' defense policy spokesman , winfried nachtwei , said the minister 's new guidelines left the " ongoing conflict over military service unresolved . "
the opposition liberal free democrats also favor an end to conscription .
the party 's spokesman on defense issues , jörg van essen , described the new guidelines as " a step in the right direction . "
speaking during a radio interview broadcast nationwide , he said it was pointless to staff the armed forces with conscripts because , under current law , only volunteers can be sent to take part in overseas missions .
peace in the world while criticizing the minister 's policy on national service , the greens welcomed the overall thrust of the new policy guidelines .
nachtwei said they would allow the bundeswehr to make its contribution " to securing peace in the world and preventing conflicts . "
at the same time , he said , they would impose the necessary limits on its powers , by making sure it worked within the frameworks laid down by international law , the united nations , nato and the european union . anger over closures meanwhile , local and regional politicians reacted angrily to the announcement that about 10 army and air force bases staffing more than 7,000 troops are slated for shutdown .
the government says the closures will release up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- in funds for overseas missions .
one of the bases slated for the chop is a tornado fighter jet base in upjever in the state of lower saxony .
state premier christian wulff , of the conservative christian democratic union , described the decision as " a blow to the coastal region . "
" all of central germany " without air defenses the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , said the planned closures would leave " all of central germany " without air defenses .
the party 's defense spokesman , christian schmidt , said the changing nature of the armed forces ' tasks meant that changes to the law were required , and not just to policy guidelines .
he also said the new guidelines failed to make clear how the minister intends to finance the bundeswehr 's new tasks with its current budget . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .
i 'm convinced it will take longer in europe , ” said kohler . “ while i think it ’ ll be ten to 20 years in iceland , i believe for europe itself it will take more like 20 , 30 , 40 years .
but making a start is important and learning from these experiences to then transfer them to europe . " but many problems still have to be solved before it gets that far .
a fuel cell-powered bus costs around six times as much as a diesel-run bus .
the cost of hydrogen power ca n't compete with gasoline or diesel , and a network of filling stations must still be built . one problem , above all , prevents fuel cell-powered motors from being employed in private cars : the fuel cells are temperature sensitive .
they are ruined when the water in their membranes freezes .

hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .
i 'm convinced it will take longer in europe , ” said kohler . “ while i think it ’ ll be ten to 20 years in iceland , i believe for europe itself it will take more like 20 , 30 , 40 years .
but making a start is important and learning from these experiences to then transfer them to europe . " but many problems still have to be solved before it gets that far .
a fuel cell-powered bus costs around six times as much as a diesel-run bus .
the cost of hydrogen power ca n't compete with gasoline or diesel , and a network of filling stations must still be built . one problem , above all , prevents fuel cell-powered motors from being employed in private cars : the fuel cells are temperature sensitive .
they are ruined when the water in their membranes freezes .
still daimlerchrysler 's engineers are optimistic about overcoming this hurdle .
and despite its frosty winters , iceland is convinced that hydrogen energy is on its way and oil is on its way out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's double-deckers to get hydrogen infusion germany 's capital city is working with volvo and a german fuel cell maker to replace its aging fleet of double-decker buses with new vehicles fueled by emission-free hydrogen .

after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .
he stated that domestic protection was no longer the bundeswehr 's main concern . german defense minister peter struck presented his new policy guidelines to leaders in chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday , drawing criticism from within the government coalition of social democrats and greens as well as from opposition parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck it 's the first new set of government defense policy guidelines in 11 years .
they 're aimed at overhauling the bundeswehr and adapting it to its changing tasks in the modern world .
new priorities the defense ministry says the bundeswehr 's most important task nowadays is peacekeeping abroad , and national defense is no longer the priority - at least in times of peace .
the new guidelines also mark a shift in domestic security policy , as they give the army powers to assume roles in anti-terrorist operations within the country 's borders , in cases where the domestic security forces do not have the required capabilities .
previously , internal military operations were considered taboo considering the role played by the nazi-controlled machtwehr during world war ii .
the ministry also said the changes would involve bitter cutbacks in some areas , including the closures of several long-standing bases to free up money for international missions .
dispute over military service struck , a social democrat , will also renew his commitment to compulsory military service despite objections from the spd 's junior coalition partners , the green party .
the greens have been campaigning for the abolition of national service for years , and there is a clause in the coalition agreement to the effect that the issue will be addressed by the current government .
in an interview on german national television on wednesday , the greens ' defense policy spokesman , winfried nachtwei , said the minister 's new guidelines left the " ongoing conflict over military service unresolved . "
the opposition liberal free democrats also favor an end to conscription .
the party 's spokesman on defense issues , jörg van essen , described the new guidelines as " a step in the right direction . "
speaking during a radio interview broadcast nationwide , he said it was pointless to staff the armed forces with conscripts because , under current law , only volunteers can be sent to take part in overseas missions .
peace in the world while criticizing the minister 's policy on national service , the greens welcomed the overall thrust of the new policy guidelines .
nachtwei said they would allow the bundeswehr to make its contribution " to securing peace in the world and preventing conflicts . "
at the same time , he said , they would impose the necessary limits on its powers , by making sure it worked within the frameworks laid down by international law , the united nations , nato and the european union . anger over closures meanwhile , local and regional politicians reacted angrily to the announcement that about 10 army and air force bases staffing more than 7,000 troops are slated for shutdown .
the government says the closures will release up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- in funds for overseas missions .
one of the bases slated for the chop is a tornado fighter jet base in upjever in the state of lower saxony .
state premier christian wulff , of the conservative christian democratic union , described the decision as " a blow to the coastal region . "
" all of central germany " without air defenses the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , said the planned closures would leave " all of central germany " without air defenses .
the party 's defense spokesman , christian schmidt , said the changing nature of the armed forces ' tasks meant that changes to the law were required , and not just to policy guidelines .
he also said the new guidelines failed to make clear how the minister intends to finance the bundeswehr 's new tasks with its current budget . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .
i 'm convinced it will take longer in europe , ” said kohler . “ while i think it ’ ll be ten to 20 years in iceland , i believe for europe itself it will take more like 20 , 30 , 40 years .
but making a start is important and learning from these experiences to then transfer them to europe . " but many problems still have to be solved before it gets that far .
a fuel cell-powered bus costs around six times as much as a diesel-run bus .
the cost of hydrogen power ca n't compete with gasoline or diesel , and a network of filling stations must still be built . one problem , above all , prevents fuel cell-powered motors from being employed in private cars : the fuel cells are temperature sensitive .
they are ruined when the water in their membranes freezes .

" transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .
i 'm convinced it will take longer in europe , ” said kohler . “ while i think it ’ ll be ten to 20 years in iceland , i believe for europe itself it will take more like 20 , 30 , 40 years .
but making a start is important and learning from these experiences to then transfer them to europe . " but many problems still have to be solved before it gets that far .
a fuel cell-powered bus costs around six times as much as a diesel-run bus .
the cost of hydrogen power ca n't compete with gasoline or diesel , and a network of filling stations must still be built . one problem , above all , prevents fuel cell-powered motors from being employed in private cars : the fuel cells are temperature sensitive .
they are ruined when the water in their membranes freezes .
still daimlerchrysler 's engineers are optimistic about overcoming this hurdle .
and despite its frosty winters , iceland is convinced that hydrogen energy is on its way and oil is on its way out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's double-deckers to get hydrogen infusion germany 's capital city is working with volvo and a german fuel cell maker to replace its aging fleet of double-decker buses with new vehicles fueled by emission-free hydrogen .

the move represents a significant about-face for the company 's top executive , who has vehemently defended the new system , heralding it as more transparent , despite harsh criticism . effective immediately , one of the most oft-attacked elements - the high cancellation fees placed on early booking " plan & spar " -lrb- " plan and save " -rrb- tickets - is being reduced from € 45 to € 15 . mehdorn conceded that " the public 's fixation on the fees acted as a deterrent , impacting long-distance -lrb- travel -rrb- bookings on the whole .

hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .

germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .
he stated that domestic protection was no longer the bundeswehr 's main concern . german defense minister peter struck presented his new policy guidelines to leaders in chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday , drawing criticism from within the government coalition of social democrats and greens as well as from opposition parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck it 's the first new set of government defense policy guidelines in 11 years .
they 're aimed at overhauling the bundeswehr and adapting it to its changing tasks in the modern world .
new priorities the defense ministry says the bundeswehr 's most important task nowadays is peacekeeping abroad , and national defense is no longer the priority - at least in times of peace .
the new guidelines also mark a shift in domestic security policy , as they give the army powers to assume roles in anti-terrorist operations within the country 's borders , in cases where the domestic security forces do not have the required capabilities .
previously , internal military operations were considered taboo considering the role played by the nazi-controlled machtwehr during world war ii .
the ministry also said the changes would involve bitter cutbacks in some areas , including the closures of several long-standing bases to free up money for international missions .
dispute over military service struck , a social democrat , will also renew his commitment to compulsory military service despite objections from the spd 's junior coalition partners , the green party .
the greens have been campaigning for the abolition of national service for years , and there is a clause in the coalition agreement to the effect that the issue will be addressed by the current government .
in an interview on german national television on wednesday , the greens ' defense policy spokesman , winfried nachtwei , said the minister 's new guidelines left the " ongoing conflict over military service unresolved . "
the opposition liberal free democrats also favor an end to conscription .
the party 's spokesman on defense issues , jörg van essen , described the new guidelines as " a step in the right direction . "
speaking during a radio interview broadcast nationwide , he said it was pointless to staff the armed forces with conscripts because , under current law , only volunteers can be sent to take part in overseas missions .
peace in the world while criticizing the minister 's policy on national service , the greens welcomed the overall thrust of the new policy guidelines .
nachtwei said they would allow the bundeswehr to make its contribution " to securing peace in the world and preventing conflicts . "
at the same time , he said , they would impose the necessary limits on its powers , by making sure it worked within the frameworks laid down by international law , the united nations , nato and the european union . anger over closures meanwhile , local and regional politicians reacted angrily to the announcement that about 10 army and air force bases staffing more than 7,000 troops are slated for shutdown .
the government says the closures will release up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- in funds for overseas missions .
one of the bases slated for the chop is a tornado fighter jet base in upjever in the state of lower saxony .
state premier christian wulff , of the conservative christian democratic union , described the decision as " a blow to the coastal region . "
" all of central germany " without air defenses the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , said the planned closures would leave " all of central germany " without air defenses .
the party 's defense spokesman , christian schmidt , said the changing nature of the armed forces ' tasks meant that changes to the law were required , and not just to policy guidelines .
he also said the new guidelines failed to make clear how the minister intends to finance the bundeswehr 's new tasks with its current budget . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .
he stated that domestic protection was no longer the bundeswehr 's main concern . german defense minister peter struck presented his new policy guidelines to leaders in chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday , drawing criticism from within the government coalition of social democrats and greens as well as from opposition parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck it 's the first new set of government defense policy guidelines in 11 years .
they 're aimed at overhauling the bundeswehr and adapting it to its changing tasks in the modern world .
new priorities the defense ministry says the bundeswehr 's most important task nowadays is peacekeeping abroad , and national defense is no longer the priority - at least in times of peace .
the new guidelines also mark a shift in domestic security policy , as they give the army powers to assume roles in anti-terrorist operations within the country 's borders , in cases where the domestic security forces do not have the required capabilities .
previously , internal military operations were considered taboo considering the role played by the nazi-controlled machtwehr during world war ii .
the ministry also said the changes would involve bitter cutbacks in some areas , including the closures of several long-standing bases to free up money for international missions .
dispute over military service struck , a social democrat , will also renew his commitment to compulsory military service despite objections from the spd 's junior coalition partners , the green party .
the greens have been campaigning for the abolition of national service for years , and there is a clause in the coalition agreement to the effect that the issue will be addressed by the current government .
in an interview on german national television on wednesday , the greens ' defense policy spokesman , winfried nachtwei , said the minister 's new guidelines left the " ongoing conflict over military service unresolved . "
the opposition liberal free democrats also favor an end to conscription .
the party 's spokesman on defense issues , jörg van essen , described the new guidelines as " a step in the right direction . "
speaking during a radio interview broadcast nationwide , he said it was pointless to staff the armed forces with conscripts because , under current law , only volunteers can be sent to take part in overseas missions .
peace in the world while criticizing the minister 's policy on national service , the greens welcomed the overall thrust of the new policy guidelines .
nachtwei said they would allow the bundeswehr to make its contribution " to securing peace in the world and preventing conflicts . "
at the same time , he said , they would impose the necessary limits on its powers , by making sure it worked within the frameworks laid down by international law , the united nations , nato and the european union . anger over closures meanwhile , local and regional politicians reacted angrily to the announcement that about 10 army and air force bases staffing more than 7,000 troops are slated for shutdown .
the government says the closures will release up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- in funds for overseas missions .
one of the bases slated for the chop is a tornado fighter jet base in upjever in the state of lower saxony .
state premier christian wulff , of the conservative christian democratic union , described the decision as " a blow to the coastal region . "
" all of central germany " without air defenses the cdu 's bavarian sister party , the christian social union , said the planned closures would leave " all of central germany " without air defenses .
the party 's defense spokesman , christian schmidt , said the changing nature of the armed forces ' tasks meant that changes to the law were required , and not just to policy guidelines .
he also said the new guidelines failed to make clear how the minister intends to finance the bundeswehr 's new tasks with its current budget . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de defense minister wants a leaner , flexible german army the german army , originally designed to fight a war from the east that never came , is past its prime .

hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .
i 'm convinced it will take longer in europe , ” said kohler . “ while i think it ’ ll be ten to 20 years in iceland , i believe for europe itself it will take more like 20 , 30 , 40 years .
but making a start is important and learning from these experiences to then transfer them to europe . " but many problems still have to be solved before it gets that far .
a fuel cell-powered bus costs around six times as much as a diesel-run bus .
the cost of hydrogen power ca n't compete with gasoline or diesel , and a network of filling stations must still be built . one problem , above all , prevents fuel cell-powered motors from being employed in private cars : the fuel cells are temperature sensitive .

after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 21.05.2003 iceland aims for oil-free energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emission-free vehicles , like daimlerchrysler 's fuel cell-powered necar 5 , could be plying reykjavik 's streets in 10 to 20 years .
hydrogen has been considered the energy source of the future for decades , but it 's still hardly used .
that 's supposed to change in iceland , which aims to become entirely independent of oil . the small north atlantic island nation iceland is rich in natural energy sources .
geothermic power plants supply residents with heat for their homes that has risen as steam from beneath the earth 's hot subsurface and the country 's rivers yield electricity from hydraulic power . despite deriving all of their heating energy and electricity from such natural sources , iceland ’ s residents still need gasoline and other petroleum products for their cars and their fishing fleet , one of the biggest in the world and the island 's most important industry . but that 's about to change , because iceland is aiming to free itself entirely from dependence on fossil fuels .
it intends to run the county ’ s motors with the fuel of the future , hydrogen , which is derived from renewable energy sources .
" icelandic new energy " program was founded in 1999 to help the country reach its ambitious goal . " we can basically say that the first ten years , meaning from the year 2000 until roughly 2008 , 2012 will be a kind of demonstration period , " general manager jon björn skulason explained .
" hopefully after a positive experience from this demonstration stage , we hope to see serial production of vehicles , ship engines and other technologies in the hydrogen sector , and this will go on until maybe 2015 , 2020 , when , as i am convinced , full commercialization will start .
and then we can really start exchanging the current transport fleet and the current ship fleet with hydrogen . " transforming water opening the world 's first public hydrogen filling station in iceland 's capital , reykjavik , was a first important step toward moving away from fossil fuels . at the station hydrogen is generated by using electricity to break water down to its basic elements , hydrogen and oxygen .
hydrogen is released as a gas , and a compressor pumps it under high pressure into a reserve tank .
when a car comes to refuel , the hydrogen is channeled through a hose into the pressurized tanks in the vehicle .
there the reverse process takes place in a fuel cell engine : hydrogen and oxygen combine into water and produce electricity that runs the car 's electrical motor . so far only one vehicle in iceland tanks up at the hydrogen filling station , and it 's just used to demonstrate how the station works .
but in the fall three fuel cell-powered city buses developed by german-american carmaker daimlerchrysler are meant to start operating on the island . cute in future daimlerchrysler hopes to test its fuel cell-powered cars and buses in action over the next year , herbert kohler , the company 's research head and chief environmental officer , told dw-radio .
the buses will be tested in nine european cities , in addition to reykjavik .
the european union is supporting the project , called clean urban transport for europe -lrb- cute -rrb- , with € 21 million -lrb- $ 24.2 million -rrb- .
by the end of this year 30 emission-free buses are supposed to be plying the streets of barcelona , hamburg , london , stockholm , among other cities . " compared to iceland , the situation in europe is naturally more complex .
we are making a start with the project in nine big cities in europe in 2003 too , also for two to three years .
i 'm convinced it will take longer in europe , ” said kohler . “ while i think it ’ ll be ten to 20 years in iceland , i believe for europe itself it will take more like 20 , 30 , 40 years .
but making a start is important and learning from these experiences to then transfer them to europe . " but many problems still have to be solved before it gets that far .
a fuel cell-powered bus costs around six times as much as a diesel-run bus .
the cost of hydrogen power ca n't compete with gasoline or diesel , and a network of filling stations must still be built . one problem , above all , prevents fuel cell-powered motors from being employed in private cars : the fuel cells are temperature sensitive .
they are ruined when the water in their membranes freezes .
still daimlerchrysler 's engineers are optimistic about overcoming this hurdle .
and despite its frosty winters , iceland is convinced that hydrogen energy is on its way and oil is on its way out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin 's double-deckers to get hydrogen infusion germany 's capital city is working with volvo and a german fuel cell maker to replace its aging fleet of double-decker buses with new vehicles fueled by emission-free hydrogen .

after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

after almost four decades of debate , the fragile city is to be equipped with 21st century flood gates . italian prime minister , silvio berlusconi marked the start of work on venice 's tidal defenses on wednesday , when he aptly laid a foundation stone from a boat .
the project , which is know as " moses , " an acronym for its technical title , is designed to save the lagoon city from tidal flooding . the plight to prevent venice from sinking under water was born way back in 1966 after many of the city 's cultural treasures were devastated by the highest tidal wave on record .
but it was n't until the city had been pounded by a further series of high tides - or acqua alta , as they are known locally - that the italian government sat up and took notice .
in 1973 the government declared it in the national interest to save the city , but it then took another three decades of studies and proposals before any final decision was made on an appropriate plan of action . modern technology the titanic new project , expected to cost some $ 7 billion , will see the construction of a mobile dyke that will cover the four main outlets from the lagoon into the adriatic sea .
a total of 78 water-filled steel barriers , which will lay dormant on the seabed , allowing normal tides to ebb and flow as normal , will only respond to threateningly high tides .
as a high tide approaches , the barriers will be pumped up with air , causing them to float and create protective dam . as sea levels across the globe continue to rise , there is concern amongst venetian port workers that the extravagant moses project could affect their livelihoods if the new flood barriers prevent ships from entering the city 's waterways .
the head of the city 's port authority , claudio boniciolli , says he is worried that if boats have to queue to enter the city , they might opt simply to skip venice altogether , which could have serious implications for the 18,000 local port employees . environmental opposition such skepticism for the project is shared by environmental groups in italy , who fear the mobile dyke will damage the fragile ecosystem of the shallow lagoon on which venice is built .
they claim that if global warming continues to push up sea levels as expected , the flood gates will remain perpetually closed , which will prevent the natural flow of the sea and ultimately render the beautiful sparkling waters upon which venice sits into nothing short of a cesspool . perilous waters constructed on millions of wooden piles pounded into marshy ground , venice was never a risk-free zone , but flooding was very rare until the mid-1900s .
since then , the acqua alta have been gradually but steadily increasing , both in number and in depth , and last year the city of gondolas recorded its worst swamping ever . there are various theories surrounding the sinking of the city , but scientists say the greatest contributing factor dates back to the 19th century when the british occupiers carved out the lagoon to enable ships to pass through on their way to port .
the effect of this early engineering was to drastically shift currents , removing the natural barrier for high tides , leaving them to hurtle in and suck out the very sediment which creates the foundation of the city as they retreat . environmentalists and engineers believe that restoring the lagoon to its natural state , with its original depth , could significantly reduce high tides and lower levels of the highest floods . but such views have been overlooked in favor of hi-tech underwater engineering , which is estimated to render venice a flood-free zone by the year 2011 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de moses parts waters and saves venice last week italy approved the moses project , a controversial series of moveable dams designed to prevent venice from sinking under the lagoon .

germany 's defense minister presented his new policy guidelines for the country 's armed forces on wednesday .
he stated that domestic protection was no longer the bundeswehr 's main concern . german defense minister peter struck presented his new policy guidelines to leaders in chancellor gerhard schröder 's cabinet on wednesday , drawing criticism from within the government coalition of social democrats and greens as well as from opposition parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister peter struck it 's the first new set of government defense policy guidelines in 11 years .
they 're aimed at overhauling the bundeswehr and adapting it to its changing tasks in the modern world .
new priorities the defense ministry says the bundeswehr 's most important task nowadays is peacekeeping abroad , and national defense is no longer the priority - at least in times of peace .
the new guidelines also mark a shift in domestic security policy , as they give the army powers to assume roles in anti-terrorist operations within the country 's borders , in cases where the domestic security forces do not have the required capabilities .
previously , internal military operations were considered taboo considering the role played by the nazi-controlled machtwehr during world war ii .
the ministry also said the changes would involve bitter cutbacks in some areas , including the closures of several long-standing bases to free up money for international missions .
dispute over military service struck , a social democrat , will also renew his commitment to compulsory military service despite objections from the spd 's junior coalition partners , the green party .
the greens have been campaigning for the abolition of national service for years , and there is a clause in the coalition agreement to the effect that the issue will be addressed by the current government .
in an interview on german national television on wednesday , the greens ' defense policy spokesman , winfried nachtwei , said the minister 's new guidelines left the " ongoing conflict over military service unresolved . "
the opposition liberal free democrats also favor an end to conscription .
the party 's spokesman on defense issues , jörg van essen , described the new guidelines as " a step in the right direction . "
speaking during a radio interview broadcast nationwide , he said it was pointless to staff the armed forces with conscripts because , under current law , only volunteers can be sent to take part in overseas missions .
peace in the world while criticizing the minister 's policy on national service , the greens welcomed the overall thrust of the new policy guidelines .
nachtwei said they would allow the bundeswehr to make its contribution " to securing peace in the world and preventing conflicts . "
at the same time , he said , they would impose the necessary limits on its powers , by making sure it worked within the frameworks laid down by international law , the united nations , nato and the european union . anger over closures meanwhile , local and regional politicians reacted angrily to the announcement that about 10 army and air force bases staffing more than 7,000 troops are slated for shutdown .
the government says the closures will release up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.17 billion -rrb- in funds for overseas missions .

the party 's defense spokesman , christian schmidt , said the changing nature of the armed forces ' tasks meant that changes to the law were required , and not just to policy guidelines .

the uefa cup final in seville on wednesday sees two clubs looking to reclaim their place among europe 's elite . two european clubs steeped in tradition will take to the field in seville 's estadio olímpico on wednesday night in the hopes of taking home the uefa cup and reclaiming their place among the continent 's soccer elite .
glasgow celtic 's last great triumph was when it won the european cup in 1967 .
fc porto won the same competition 20 years later , but has n't been in a european final since .
scottish invasion central seville was swamped in green and white on wednesday ahead of the match , as thousands of celtic fans kicked off their pre-match celebrations .
although the club was allocated only 15,000 tickets for the big game , thousands more are expected to arrive just for the party .
estimates range from 40,000 to 70,000 celtic supporters from glasgow and as far afield as the united states and australia .
most of the porto fans are expected to drive down just in time for the match .
porto injury-free porto coach jose mourinho has no serious injury worries .
he 's without suspended forward helder postiga , who was sent off in the semi-final , but midfielder francisco costinha has been declared fit again after he pulled a muscle in a domestic league match just over a week ago .
defender nuno valente , who was considered doubtful for the game , is also fit to line out .
mourinho is playing his cards close to his chest , and has yet to reveal who will partner derlei silva , the tournament 's top scorer with ten goals so far , up front .
he has a choice between edgaras jankauskas and nuno capucho , both of whom scored in saturday 's victory over varzim in the portuguese premier league .
he 's expected to use his standard back four of paolo ferreira , jorge costa , ricardo carvalho and valente .
as usual , vitor baia will be between the posts .
in midfield , costinha is likely to be joined by playmaker deco souza , maniche ribeiro and dmitri alenitchev .
hartson out for celtic celtic coach martin o 'neill will have to go without the services of striker john hartson , a key figure in their european campaign until now .
hartson has been ruled out due to a back injury .
but o 'neill can still count on a powerful strike force that includes chris sutton and henrik larsson , who has scored 28 league goals this season and nine in the uefa cup .
central midfielder stilian petrov will by joined by alan thompson , paul lambert , neil lennon and didier agathe , who strikes fear into the hearts of defenders with his scintillating pace down the wing .
robert douglas in goal will enjoy the protection of joos valgaeren , bobo balde and johann mjallby .
if o 'neill opts for a more defensive line-up , lambert may have to make way for jackie mcnamara .
two approaches to history the two coaches have adopted different approaches to the historical burden on their players ' shoulders .
martin o 'neill says his players will be full of pride as they walk out onto the pitch and remember the club 's most famous triumph in 1967 .
" the important thing is that we embrace the club 's history and not be frightened of it , " he said .

mourinho has already complained about the state of the pitch , describing it as " very slow and full of holes . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 21.05.2003 deutsche bahn reforms new price system großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with great fanfare deutsche bahn introduced its new price system last december following months of criticism and heavy losses , germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn , is rolling back some of the most controversial elements of the new price system - more changes are expected by year 's end . at a meeting of deutsche bahn 's board of directors on tuesday , chairman hartmut mehdorn gave in to pressure and announced changes to the controversial new pricing system ushered in last december .
the move represents a significant about-face for the company 's top executive , who has vehemently defended the new system , heralding it as more transparent , despite harsh criticism . effective immediately , one of the most oft-attacked elements - the high cancellation fees placed on early booking " plan & spar " -lrb- " plan and save " -rrb- tickets - is being reduced from € 45 to € 15 . mehdorn conceded that " the public 's fixation on the fees acted as a deterrent , impacting long-distance -lrb- travel -rrb- bookings on the whole . " new prices spark backlash mehdorn is yielding to public pressure , made all the worse by heavy losses in the first quarter of this year , when long-distance travel decreased by 6.1 percent , contributing to a loss of € 133 million .
for mehdorn , who had hoped to limit deutsche bahn 's losses to € 200 million this year and achieve profits of € 400 million as early as next year , the shift represented quite a setback . rail travelers simply did not accept the changes .
at a time when train travel faces increased competition from budget airlines , many can and did opt to take to the skies . high cancellation fees , the replacement of the much-loved " bahncard " -lrb- train card -rrb- - which used to allow customers to travel at a 50 percent discount - with a newer version that only offered 25 percent of the savings , and the increased cost of spontaneous travel - led to enormous price increases that fueled the consumer backlash .
tickets on some routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spontaneous , business and tourist travelers particularly hard . after the introduction of the new price system last december , the berlin-based german daily die tageszeitung famously called mehdorn the " rumsfeld of the rails . "
and editorials around the country called for his resignation .
federal transportation minister manfred stolpe of the ruling social democrats joined the chorus of critics , stating that " the new price system is not well designed and its implementation has not gone well . " more changes on the way there could be more changes by year 's end .
the rules governing the number of stops and overnight stays allowed with a " plan & spar " ticket may be relaxed , giving travelers a bit more flexibility . what 's more , restrictions dictating that part of a " plan & spar " journey take place over a weekend may be dropped . last but not least , the 50 percent rebate for " bahncard " travelers may return , should green party members , who have been supporting such a measure , be successful in pushing through their agenda . corporate casualities despite calls for his resignation , chairman mehdorn seems to have weathered the storm - at least for now .
his contract was extended tuesday through 2008 , and transportation minister stolpe expressed his support for the embattled executive : " mehdorn is the right man for the job . " some other top executives at the company have not fared so well .
the controversy over the price system claimed two : christoph franz , a member of the board of directors and head of passenger traffic , and hans gustav koch , head of marketing , were both forced to leave the company . should the changes not be enough to appease angered rail travelers , the entire price system may be scrapped .
and more changes among deutsche bahn 's top brass may follow . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de criticism of new german train fares grows politicians and consumers groups have insisted the german railway 's new pricing system is too expensive .

the conservation organisation wwf northern ireland says amateur gardeners are responsible for two thirds of all peat consumption and use almost twice as much peat as professional growers .
the report , which comes out as thousands of people enjoy the chelsea flower show , cites the popularity of gardening programmes and the public 's desire for instant gardens for a huge growth in the use of peat .
the report , published on wednesday in association with traffic , a wildlife trade monitoring network , says the use of peat is increasing so rapidly local suppliers can not not meet demand .
as a result , peat has to be imported from the republic of ireland or countries such as latvia and estonia .

" wwf believes that a change in consumer attitudes is required if we are to prevent peat bogs locally or elsewhere in the world being destroyed to provide compost .

a chill in the air , low-light conditions and even magnetic fields may trigger feelings that " a presence " is in a room - but that is all they are , feelings .
this explanation of ghosts is the result of a large study in which researchers led hundreds of volunteers around two of the uk 's supposedly most haunted locations - hampton court palace , england , and the south bridge vaults in edinburgh , scotland .
dr richard wiseman , of the university of hertfordshire , and his colleagues say their work has thrown up some interesting data to suggest why so many people can be spooked in the same building but provides no evidence that ghosts are real .
clustered experiences in hampton court - alleged to contain the ghost of the executed catherine howard , 5th wife of henry viii - the volunteers were asked to face their fear .
unusual experiences the top image was taken in south bridge vault 9 the bottom image was taken just five minutes later how does one explain the white fuzz ?
an artefact of processing ?
they had to record any unusual experiences , such as hearing footsteps , feeling cold or a presence in the room , as well as marking the location and intensity of the experience on a floor plan .
before this , candidates were also asked to reveal any prior knowledge of hauntings at the site .
the researchers then examined the distribution of unusual experiences .
in a " normal " setting , you would expect the ghostly encounters to be evenly spaced , but in classic haunting , they would be clustered around certain places .
the results were striking : participants did record a higher number of unusual experiences in the most classically haunted places of hampton court , areas such as the georgian rooms and the haunted gallery .
and in the edinburgh vaults , the result was the same - the vaults considered most haunted were the locations where the most unusual encounters occurred during the study .
environmental cues the researchers interpret this as evidence that hauntings are a real phenomenon because they are concentrated in specific places over time .
the role of magnetism " when we measure houses where pervasive haunts occur , the place where the occupants find they can sleep , by trial and error , has the most consistent and normal field strengths " dr michael persinger indeed , it is known for people from different cultures to consistently report similar experiences over perhaps hundreds of years .
" hauntings exist , in the sense that places exist where people reliably have unusual experiences , " dr richard wiseman told bbc news online .
" the existence of ghosts is a way of explaining these experiences . "
but are the ghosts real ?
dr wiseman and his colleagues are not so sure .
they claim , somewhat paradoxically , that the hauntings exist but the ghosts do not .
" people do have consistent experiences in consistent places , but i think that this is driven by visual factors mainly , and perhaps some other environmental cues , " he said .
sensitive people making detailed measurements at each place , such as temperature , light intensity and room space , dr wiseman thinks that people are responding unconsciously to environmental cues and the general " spookiness " of their surroundings .
have your say " to the believer no proof is required , to the sceptic , no proof is sufficient " doug , uk he cites examples of mediums successfully indicating haunted areas of buildings with no prior knowledge of them .
spiritualists interpret this as evidence that the ghosts are there , but another explanation is that the mediums are simply more sensitive to the environmental cues that result in haunted feelings - not sensitivity to the ghosts themselves .
sceptics have long maintained that ghostly encounters are influenced by a person 's knowledge of the place and its history , the " prior knowledge hypothesis " .
but this study refutes that explanation , as the statistics showed that prior knowledge did not affect the areas in which strange experiences were recorded .
" we found little if no evidence that people 's prior knowledge mattered , " said dr wiseman .
" if anything , it made them veer away from having experiences in the known haunted sites . "
dr wiseman and colleagues report their data in the british journal of psychology .

the association of chief police officers ' annual conference was told by the organisation 's firearms spokesman : " it 's coming your way , believe me . "
alan green , deputy chief constable of greater manchester police -lrb- gmp -rrb- said police bosses were " burying their head in the sand " if they did not think firearms crime a problem in their area .
mr green 's warning comes after murders doubled in nottinghamshire as gun crime increased last summer .
mr green said : " gun crime , impacting particularly on our black communities , has spread across this country like a cancer . "
i was amazed at the state of investigation into guns , it was chaotic alan green dcc a new national firearms database is now up and running to help track the use of individual weapons , delegates were told at the nec in birmingham .
having worked with the royal ulster constabulary for 20 years before moving to gmp , mr green said force attitudes to gun crime were very poor when he arrived .
he said : " i was amazed at the state of investigation into guns .
it was chaotic .
" people had n't got a clue about what guns had been used and where guns had been used . "
mr green said forces that currently have little or no gun crime could look out for a number of warning signs .
these included the existence of drug dealing and prostitution or the fact a neighbouring force had a problem with firearms crime , he said .
' straightforward assassinations ' " it could just be down to having good road links with forces that have a problem , " he said .
" one of the movements was from wolverhampton to aberdeen after one group recognised a dearth of talent in prostitution in aberdeen and moved people up there . "
nottinghamshire chief constable steve green told the conference said that after gun crime " spiralled out of control " officers launched a campaign code-named operation stealth .
a large slice of the increase in deaths came from " straightforward assassinations ... that 12 months ago were unheard of in nottinghamshire , " said detective chief superintendent phillip davies .
the operation has since led to 352 arrests , 75 % of which were later charged with significant offences .

producer stuart hughes was filming in the kurdish-held town of kifri , when his four-man crew was mistakenly guided into a minefield .
in the explosions which followed , stuart 's colleague , cameraman kaveh golestan , 52 , was killed and stuart 's injuries were so severe that his foot and lower leg later had to be amputated .
the 31-year-old is now undergoing rehabilitation in his home city of cardiff , and has become a patron of manchester-based mine clearance charity , mines advisory group -lrb- mag -rrb- .
he is writing a weekly diary on his recovery for bbc wales news online .
stuart has been pictured with landmines similar to the one which caused his injuries to publicise mag 's campaign .
he said : " when i first saw it i found it very upsetting .
" to think that something so small and innocuous maimed me for life and killed a friend and colleague is an upsetting thing .
" i do not feel angry towards the people who laid the mines .
" i 'm aware that they are just following orders and it is difficult to feel any bitterness towards them .
" but i do feel angry at those still involved in the trading of mines . "
mag needs people like stuart to help champion our work " lou mcgrath , mag " as far as i am concerned they certainly do not follow the rules of war . "
stuart has said he was shocked to discover the true extent of the landmine problem in northern iraq , in which dozens of people , mainly children , have been killed .
he added : " mag was the only mine clearance organisation working in the region .
" as a landmine survivor myself i am proud to be able to support mag 's work in trying to rid northern iraq of the scourge of these horrific weapons . "
mag employs almost 2,000 people world-wide with specialist teams in lebanon , angola , cambodia , laos , afghanistan , vietnam , sri lanka , sudan and iraq .
' character ' mag chairman lou mcgrath said : " we are overwhelmed by stuart 's support .
" it shows huge strength of character to be able to talk about his experiences while he is still coming to terms with them .
" we felt compelled to make him a patron and we were thrilled when he accepted and wanted to join our cause .
" mag needs people like stuart to help champion our work and help us raise desperately-needed funds . "
