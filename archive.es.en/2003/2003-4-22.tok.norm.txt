ullrich , 29 , as well known for his out of the saddle exploits as for his cycling prowess , humbled a generally modest field to secure a symbolic win in the 202.3 kilometer " around cologne " event , his first race in his home country since injuries and a drugs scandal sidelined the former tour de france winner .
riding for his new team team coast after falling out with the magenta-clad team telekom , the rostock-born cyclist dominated the last 53 kilometers alone , and almost two minutes ahead of his nearest challenger , former telekom teammate danilo hondo , to finish first in the 88th annual race .
a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .
miracle win " there are still miracles , " said ullrich after the race to the throng of jostling reporters , an indication of his standing despite his history of problems .
" i wanted to get a good start in germany , but certainly no one expected it to go as well as this .
i 'm incredibly happy . "

ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .
the road to ullrich 's latest recovery began when he returned to training last november and continued in january of this year when he signed with coast .
he returned to racing earlier this month in the tour de la sarthe in france and took part in the tour of aragon in spain last week .

my season high point could be the world championships in canada in the autumn . "
many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .
" i have n't yet had a lot of contact with the others -lrb- his fellow team coast riders -rrb- but do n't anticipate any problems there , " ullrich said .
" we were together for 12 days in spain ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.04.2003 europe increases measures to halt bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian and dutch poultry exports have been banned .
the european commission on tuesday strengthened precautionary measures aimed at stopping a contagious bird virus that has already spread from the netherlands to belgium and claimed the life of a dutch veterinarian . commission officials in brussels banned the export of belgian poultry products throughout the european union and to other countries until friday .
over the weekend there were at least two new confirmed cases of the flu in belgium 's eastern limburg region .
the country has already slaughtered a quarter of a million birds to halt the disease . the avian flu spilled over into belgium from the netherlands , where it has devastated the poultry industry .
since the disease 's discovery in february , dutch farmers have culled 15 million birds out of a total population of 100 million . the export ban alone is costing the dutch poultry industry an estimated € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- a day . bird flu in victim 's lungs the dutch health ministry said on saturday that the flu had also caused the death of a dutch veterinarian .
the 57-year-old man died on thursday after catching pneumonia two days after working on a farm where bird flu infections had been discovered . “ the severity of this case is surprising , but similar instances are to be expected , ” uwe truyen from the university of leipzig told the german press agency dpa .
he said he suspected that the veterinarian had also been infected with another virus , which weakened his immune system . but investigators in holland told new scientist magazine that large amounts of the bird flu had been found in the man 's lungs , but no other viruses that could have caused his death . dutch public health officials have also detected the illness in pigs on five farms in the gelder valley region , new scientist reported . the bird flu 's spread has caused concern that the poultry virus could spark an epidemic like severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which has hit several countries in asia and canada .
but officials from the world health organization said the bird flu had little in common with sars and there was no evidence that it could transfer to humans .

the european commission on tuesday strengthened precautionary measures aimed at stopping a contagious bird virus that has already spread from the netherlands to belgium and claimed the life of a dutch veterinarian . commission officials in brussels banned the export of belgian poultry products throughout the european union and to other countries until friday .
over the weekend there were at least two new confirmed cases of the flu in belgium 's eastern limburg region .
the country has already slaughtered a quarter of a million birds to halt the disease . the avian flu spilled over into belgium from the netherlands , where it has devastated the poultry industry .
since the disease 's discovery in february , dutch farmers have culled 15 million birds out of a total population of 100 million . the export ban alone is costing the dutch poultry industry an estimated € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- a day . bird flu in victim 's lungs the dutch health ministry said on saturday that the flu had also caused the death of a dutch veterinarian .
the 57-year-old man died on thursday after catching pneumonia two days after working on a farm where bird flu infections had been discovered . “ the severity of this case is surprising , but similar instances are to be expected , ” uwe truyen from the university of leipzig told the german press agency dpa .
he said he suspected that the veterinarian had also been infected with another virus , which weakened his immune system . but investigators in holland told new scientist magazine that large amounts of the bird flu had been found in the man 's lungs , but no other viruses that could have caused his death . dutch public health officials have also detected the illness in pigs on five farms in the gelder valley region , new scientist reported . the bird flu 's spread has caused concern that the poultry virus could spark an epidemic like severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which has hit several countries in asia and canada .
but officials from the world health organization said the bird flu had little in common with sars and there was no evidence that it could transfer to humans .

as the most successful leaders of the greens , they secured representation of the environmental party in two successive german governments and scored the highest-ever result for the greens in a national election last fall .
despite their superlative success , the leadership duo fell victim to a party rule stipulating that senior officials in the green party hierarchy are not allowed to hold seats in germany 's parliament at the same time .
last december , those who wanted to scrap the rule failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority at a party congress .
it was the victory of a tiny but vocal group of green traditionalists who have become the party 's pacifist and environmental conscience at a time when pragmatism often seems to bury green principles .
reinhard bütikofer and green defense expert angelika beer are the current co-chairs of the party .
bütikofer himself does n't want to keep the old rule , but he has some understanding for those clinging to it .
" i can understand why some party members want to stick to this principle for the sake of balancing power within the party , " he said .
" but on the other hand , we have come to understand that curtailing power has never really worked . "
the obvious example is german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has been the undisputed party ruler for 10 years and the most powerful of all greens .
fischer finally got around to running for a party post only two years ago .
a compromise now , more than 43,000 green party members are set to cast votes on the divisive issue of separating the party leadership from party mandates in parliament .
the current leadership , however , has taken the sting out of previous resolutions that called for scrapping the rule altogether .
as a compromise , bütikofer and beer now propose that about one-third of the six member board of the greens should be allowed to have parliamentary mandates .
bütikofer said he believed party members would approve the change .
" i think this proposal will find a majority , " he said .
" at the last party congress , we were just eight votes short of a two-thirds majority .
i assume the vote will produce more or less the same result . "
but there 's a major difference this time around : only a simple majority will be required to approve the change .
neither bütikofer nor beer need fear for their posts : their successful predecessors , roth and kühn , have received better-paid mandates in the german parliament .
it 's highly unlikely they will seek to resume their roles managing the party .

it was the victory of a tiny but vocal group of green traditionalists who have become the party 's pacifist and environmental conscience at a time when pragmatism often seems to bury green principles .
reinhard bütikofer and green defense expert angelika beer are the current co-chairs of the party .
bütikofer himself does n't want to keep the old rule , but he has some understanding for those clinging to it .
" i can understand why some party members want to stick to this principle for the sake of balancing power within the party , " he said .
" but on the other hand , we have come to understand that curtailing power has never really worked . "
the obvious example is german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has been the undisputed party ruler for 10 years and the most powerful of all greens .
fischer finally got around to running for a party post only two years ago .
a compromise now , more than 43,000 green party members are set to cast votes on the divisive issue of separating the party leadership from party mandates in parliament .
the current leadership , however , has taken the sting out of previous resolutions that called for scrapping the rule altogether .
as a compromise , bütikofer and beer now propose that about one-third of the six member board of the greens should be allowed to have parliamentary mandates .
bütikofer said he believed party members would approve the change .
" i think this proposal will find a majority , " he said .
" at the last party congress , we were just eight votes short of a two-thirds majority .
i assume the vote will produce more or less the same result . "
but there 's a major difference this time around : only a simple majority will be required to approve the change .
neither bütikofer nor beer need fear for their posts : their successful predecessors , roth and kühn , have received better-paid mandates in the german parliament .
it 's highly unlikely they will seek to resume their roles managing the party .
the party will continue to collect ballots through may 13 , with a final result expected to be released on may 23 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens find new posts for former leaders after party rules forced them from their posts in december , former green party chiefs claudia roth and fritz kuhn have been assigned new positions .

ullrich , 29 , as well known for his out of the saddle exploits as for his cycling prowess , humbled a generally modest field to secure a symbolic win in the 202.3 kilometer " around cologne " event , his first race in his home country since injuries and a drugs scandal sidelined the former tour de france winner .

a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .
miracle win " there are still miracles , " said ullrich after the race to the throng of jostling reporters , an indication of his standing despite his history of problems .
" i wanted to get a good start in germany , but certainly no one expected it to go as well as this .

ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .

many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .

ullrich , 29 , as well known for his out of the saddle exploits as for his cycling prowess , humbled a generally modest field to secure a symbolic win in the 202.3 kilometer " around cologne " event , his first race in his home country since injuries and a drugs scandal sidelined the former tour de france winner .
riding for his new team team coast after falling out with the magenta-clad team telekom , the rostock-born cyclist dominated the last 53 kilometers alone , and almost two minutes ahead of his nearest challenger , former telekom teammate danilo hondo , to finish first in the 88th annual race .
a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .
miracle win " there are still miracles , " said ullrich after the race to the throng of jostling reporters , an indication of his standing despite his history of problems .
" i wanted to get a good start in germany , but certainly no one expected it to go as well as this .
i 'm incredibly happy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naughty boy .
ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .
the road to ullrich 's latest recovery began when he returned to training last november and continued in january of this year when he signed with coast .
he returned to racing earlier this month in the tour de la sarthe in france and took part in the tour of aragon in spain last week .
where his career goes from here is in his own hands but his quest for the pinnacles of the sport is as evident as ever before .
tour de france is the goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour champion lance armstrong .
" i 'm not interested in the problems in the past and those that may possibly be in front of me , " ullrich said .
" i 'm concentrating on my comeback .
the goal is the tour de france .
that 's where i want to see how far along i am against lance armstrong -lrb- four times tour winner , photo -rrb- .
my season high point could be the world championships in canada in the autumn . "
many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .
" i have n't yet had a lot of contact with the others -lrb- his fellow team coast riders -rrb- but do n't anticipate any problems there , " ullrich said .
" we were together for 12 days in spain ...
sure , there are some who are unhappy but we have to deflect that .
we are trying to keep the team together . "
but monday 's victory almost was n't such a happy return to his native land for ullrich and his new teammates .
team coast 's license was temporarily withdrawn by ruling body uci over non-payment of riders ' wages but it was returned to them last month before the uci confirmed last tuesday that the team had the right to compete until the end of the year .
team coast spokesman marcel wuest said the uci had received evidence that the riders had been paid .

as the most successful leaders of the greens , they secured representation of the environmental party in two successive german governments and scored the highest-ever result for the greens in a national election last fall .
despite their superlative success , the leadership duo fell victim to a party rule stipulating that senior officials in the green party hierarchy are not allowed to hold seats in germany 's parliament at the same time .
last december , those who wanted to scrap the rule failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority at a party congress .
it was the victory of a tiny but vocal group of green traditionalists who have become the party 's pacifist and environmental conscience at a time when pragmatism often seems to bury green principles .
reinhard bütikofer and green defense expert angelika beer are the current co-chairs of the party .
bütikofer himself does n't want to keep the old rule , but he has some understanding for those clinging to it .
" i can understand why some party members want to stick to this principle for the sake of balancing power within the party , " he said .
" but on the other hand , we have come to understand that curtailing power has never really worked . "
the obvious example is german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has been the undisputed party ruler for 10 years and the most powerful of all greens .
fischer finally got around to running for a party post only two years ago .
a compromise now , more than 43,000 green party members are set to cast votes on the divisive issue of separating the party leadership from party mandates in parliament .
the current leadership , however , has taken the sting out of previous resolutions that called for scrapping the rule altogether .
as a compromise , bütikofer and beer now propose that about one-third of the six member board of the greens should be allowed to have parliamentary mandates .
bütikofer said he believed party members would approve the change .
" i think this proposal will find a majority , " he said .
" at the last party congress , we were just eight votes short of a two-thirds majority .
i assume the vote will produce more or less the same result . "
but there 's a major difference this time around : only a simple majority will be required to approve the change .
neither bütikofer nor beer need fear for their posts : their successful predecessors , roth and kühn , have received better-paid mandates in the german parliament .
it 's highly unlikely they will seek to resume their roles managing the party .
the party will continue to collect ballots through may 13 , with a final result expected to be released on may 23 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens find new posts for former leaders after party rules forced them from their posts in december , former green party chiefs claudia roth and fritz kuhn have been assigned new positions .

the european commission on tuesday strengthened precautionary measures aimed at stopping a contagious bird virus that has already spread from the netherlands to belgium and claimed the life of a dutch veterinarian . commission officials in brussels banned the export of belgian poultry products throughout the european union and to other countries until friday .
over the weekend there were at least two new confirmed cases of the flu in belgium 's eastern limburg region .
the country has already slaughtered a quarter of a million birds to halt the disease . the avian flu spilled over into belgium from the netherlands , where it has devastated the poultry industry .
since the disease 's discovery in february , dutch farmers have culled 15 million birds out of a total population of 100 million . the export ban alone is costing the dutch poultry industry an estimated € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- a day . bird flu in victim 's lungs the dutch health ministry said on saturday that the flu had also caused the death of a dutch veterinarian .
the 57-year-old man died on thursday after catching pneumonia two days after working on a farm where bird flu infections had been discovered . “ the severity of this case is surprising , but similar instances are to be expected , ” uwe truyen from the university of leipzig told the german press agency dpa .
he said he suspected that the veterinarian had also been infected with another virus , which weakened his immune system . but investigators in holland told new scientist magazine that large amounts of the bird flu had been found in the man 's lungs , but no other viruses that could have caused his death . dutch public health officials have also detected the illness in pigs on five farms in the gelder valley region , new scientist reported . the bird flu 's spread has caused concern that the poultry virus could spark an epidemic like severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which has hit several countries in asia and canada .
but officials from the world health organization said the bird flu had little in common with sars and there was no evidence that it could transfer to humans .
six people died in hong kong in 1997 from an outbreak of a bird virus . in holland , health officials also sought to assuage public fears the bird flu had mutated into something that could easily spread among humans .

in addition to the vet , some workers culling the birds have reported eye-infections and flu symptoms .

the european commission on tuesday strengthened precautionary measures aimed at stopping a contagious bird virus that has already spread from the netherlands to belgium and claimed the life of a dutch veterinarian . commission officials in brussels banned the export of belgian poultry products throughout the european union and to other countries until friday .
over the weekend there were at least two new confirmed cases of the flu in belgium 's eastern limburg region .
the country has already slaughtered a quarter of a million birds to halt the disease . the avian flu spilled over into belgium from the netherlands , where it has devastated the poultry industry .
since the disease 's discovery in february , dutch farmers have culled 15 million birds out of a total population of 100 million . the export ban alone is costing the dutch poultry industry an estimated € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- a day . bird flu in victim 's lungs the dutch health ministry said on saturday that the flu had also caused the death of a dutch veterinarian .
the 57-year-old man died on thursday after catching pneumonia two days after working on a farm where bird flu infections had been discovered . “ the severity of this case is surprising , but similar instances are to be expected , ” uwe truyen from the university of leipzig told the german press agency dpa .
he said he suspected that the veterinarian had also been infected with another virus , which weakened his immune system . but investigators in holland told new scientist magazine that large amounts of the bird flu had been found in the man 's lungs , but no other viruses that could have caused his death . dutch public health officials have also detected the illness in pigs on five farms in the gelder valley region , new scientist reported . the bird flu 's spread has caused concern that the poultry virus could spark an epidemic like severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which has hit several countries in asia and canada .
but officials from the world health organization said the bird flu had little in common with sars and there was no evidence that it could transfer to humans .
six people died in hong kong in 1997 from an outbreak of a bird virus . in holland , health officials also sought to assuage public fears the bird flu had mutated into something that could easily spread among humans .
" we now know there 's no mutation of the virus , we know for sure that the vet died of the original bird flu .
it 's very good to know that , " dutch health ministry spokesman bas kuik told the news agency reuters . governments encourage vaccinations both the dutch and belgian governments have stepped up human flu and bird flu vaccination efforts for workers who come into regular contact with fowl that could be affected by the illness .
in addition to the vet , some workers culling the birds have reported eye-infections and flu symptoms .
kuik even suggested on tuesday the vet 's death might have been prevented if he had obtained a vaccination . " if he had taken his anti-virals he probably would n't have died , " kuik told reuters . in germany , small groups of birds near the dutch and belgian borders have been culled as a precaution , but no confirmed cases have yet been found . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first domestic europe sars case confirmed the first domestic european sars case was confirmed by the british department of health monday night , as a german firm begins delivering a new high speed test for the virus .

as the most successful leaders of the greens , they secured representation of the environmental party in two successive german governments and scored the highest-ever result for the greens in a national election last fall .
despite their superlative success , the leadership duo fell victim to a party rule stipulating that senior officials in the green party hierarchy are not allowed to hold seats in germany 's parliament at the same time .
last december , those who wanted to scrap the rule failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority at a party congress .
it was the victory of a tiny but vocal group of green traditionalists who have become the party 's pacifist and environmental conscience at a time when pragmatism often seems to bury green principles .
reinhard bütikofer and green defense expert angelika beer are the current co-chairs of the party .
bütikofer himself does n't want to keep the old rule , but he has some understanding for those clinging to it .
" i can understand why some party members want to stick to this principle for the sake of balancing power within the party , " he said .
" but on the other hand , we have come to understand that curtailing power has never really worked . "
the obvious example is german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has been the undisputed party ruler for 10 years and the most powerful of all greens .
fischer finally got around to running for a party post only two years ago .
a compromise now , more than 43,000 green party members are set to cast votes on the divisive issue of separating the party leadership from party mandates in parliament .
the current leadership , however , has taken the sting out of previous resolutions that called for scrapping the rule altogether .
as a compromise , bütikofer and beer now propose that about one-third of the six member board of the greens should be allowed to have parliamentary mandates .
bütikofer said he believed party members would approve the change .
" i think this proposal will find a majority , " he said .
" at the last party congress , we were just eight votes short of a two-thirds majority .
i assume the vote will produce more or less the same result . "
but there 's a major difference this time around : only a simple majority will be required to approve the change .
neither bütikofer nor beer need fear for their posts : their successful predecessors , roth and kühn , have received better-paid mandates in the german parliament .
it 's highly unlikely they will seek to resume their roles managing the party .

ullrich , 29 , as well known for his out of the saddle exploits as for his cycling prowess , humbled a generally modest field to secure a symbolic win in the 202.3 kilometer " around cologne " event , his first race in his home country since injuries and a drugs scandal sidelined the former tour de france winner .
riding for his new team team coast after falling out with the magenta-clad team telekom , the rostock-born cyclist dominated the last 53 kilometers alone , and almost two minutes ahead of his nearest challenger , former telekom teammate danilo hondo , to finish first in the 88th annual race .
a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .
miracle win " there are still miracles , " said ullrich after the race to the throng of jostling reporters , an indication of his standing despite his history of problems .
" i wanted to get a good start in germany , but certainly no one expected it to go as well as this .
i 'm incredibly happy . "

ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .
the road to ullrich 's latest recovery began when he returned to training last november and continued in january of this year when he signed with coast .
he returned to racing earlier this month in the tour de la sarthe in france and took part in the tour of aragon in spain last week .
where his career goes from here is in his own hands but his quest for the pinnacles of the sport is as evident as ever before .
tour de france is the goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour champion lance armstrong .
" i 'm not interested in the problems in the past and those that may possibly be in front of me , " ullrich said .
" i 'm concentrating on my comeback .
the goal is the tour de france .
that 's where i want to see how far along i am against lance armstrong -lrb- four times tour winner , photo -rrb- .
my season high point could be the world championships in canada in the autumn . "
many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .
" i have n't yet had a lot of contact with the others -lrb- his fellow team coast riders -rrb- but do n't anticipate any problems there , " ullrich said .
" we were together for 12 days in spain ...
sure , there are some who are unhappy but we have to deflect that .
we are trying to keep the team together . "
but monday 's victory almost was n't such a happy return to his native land for ullrich and his new teammates .
team coast 's license was temporarily withdrawn by ruling body uci over non-payment of riders ' wages but it was returned to them last month before the uci confirmed last tuesday that the team had the right to compete until the end of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.04.2003 greens to vote on party change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding steady at the helm : the greens ' reinhard bütikofer and angelika beer after losing the two party chiefs who stewarded the greens to their best election results ever last year , members of the party are now voting on a major change to their charter . the credentials of former green party leaders claudia roth and fritz kühn are impressive .
as the most successful leaders of the greens , they secured representation of the environmental party in two successive german governments and scored the highest-ever result for the greens in a national election last fall .
despite their superlative success , the leadership duo fell victim to a party rule stipulating that senior officials in the green party hierarchy are not allowed to hold seats in germany 's parliament at the same time .
last december , those who wanted to scrap the rule failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority at a party congress .
it was the victory of a tiny but vocal group of green traditionalists who have become the party 's pacifist and environmental conscience at a time when pragmatism often seems to bury green principles .
reinhard bütikofer and green defense expert angelika beer are the current co-chairs of the party .
bütikofer himself does n't want to keep the old rule , but he has some understanding for those clinging to it .
" i can understand why some party members want to stick to this principle for the sake of balancing power within the party , " he said .
" but on the other hand , we have come to understand that curtailing power has never really worked . "
the obvious example is german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has been the undisputed party ruler for 10 years and the most powerful of all greens .
fischer finally got around to running for a party post only two years ago .
a compromise now , more than 43,000 green party members are set to cast votes on the divisive issue of separating the party leadership from party mandates in parliament .
the current leadership , however , has taken the sting out of previous resolutions that called for scrapping the rule altogether .
as a compromise , bütikofer and beer now propose that about one-third of the six member board of the greens should be allowed to have parliamentary mandates .
bütikofer said he believed party members would approve the change .
" i think this proposal will find a majority , " he said .
" at the last party congress , we were just eight votes short of a two-thirds majority .
i assume the vote will produce more or less the same result . "
but there 's a major difference this time around : only a simple majority will be required to approve the change .
neither bütikofer nor beer need fear for their posts : their successful predecessors , roth and kühn , have received better-paid mandates in the german parliament .
it 's highly unlikely they will seek to resume their roles managing the party .
the party will continue to collect ballots through may 13 , with a final result expected to be released on may 23 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens find new posts for former leaders after party rules forced them from their posts in december , former green party chiefs claudia roth and fritz kuhn have been assigned new positions .

the european commission on tuesday strengthened precautionary measures aimed at stopping a contagious bird virus that has already spread from the netherlands to belgium and claimed the life of a dutch veterinarian . commission officials in brussels banned the export of belgian poultry products throughout the european union and to other countries until friday .
over the weekend there were at least two new confirmed cases of the flu in belgium 's eastern limburg region .
the country has already slaughtered a quarter of a million birds to halt the disease . the avian flu spilled over into belgium from the netherlands , where it has devastated the poultry industry .
since the disease 's discovery in february , dutch farmers have culled 15 million birds out of a total population of 100 million . the export ban alone is costing the dutch poultry industry an estimated € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- a day . bird flu in victim 's lungs the dutch health ministry said on saturday that the flu had also caused the death of a dutch veterinarian .
the 57-year-old man died on thursday after catching pneumonia two days after working on a farm where bird flu infections had been discovered . “ the severity of this case is surprising , but similar instances are to be expected , ” uwe truyen from the university of leipzig told the german press agency dpa .
he said he suspected that the veterinarian had also been infected with another virus , which weakened his immune system . but investigators in holland told new scientist magazine that large amounts of the bird flu had been found in the man 's lungs , but no other viruses that could have caused his death . dutch public health officials have also detected the illness in pigs on five farms in the gelder valley region , new scientist reported . the bird flu 's spread has caused concern that the poultry virus could spark an epidemic like severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which has hit several countries in asia and canada .
but officials from the world health organization said the bird flu had little in common with sars and there was no evidence that it could transfer to humans .
six people died in hong kong in 1997 from an outbreak of a bird virus . in holland , health officials also sought to assuage public fears the bird flu had mutated into something that could easily spread among humans .
" we now know there 's no mutation of the virus , we know for sure that the vet died of the original bird flu .
it 's very good to know that , " dutch health ministry spokesman bas kuik told the news agency reuters . governments encourage vaccinations both the dutch and belgian governments have stepped up human flu and bird flu vaccination efforts for workers who come into regular contact with fowl that could be affected by the illness .
in addition to the vet , some workers culling the birds have reported eye-infections and flu symptoms .
kuik even suggested on tuesday the vet 's death might have been prevented if he had obtained a vaccination . " if he had taken his anti-virals he probably would n't have died , " kuik told reuters . in germany , small groups of birds near the dutch and belgian borders have been culled as a precaution , but no confirmed cases have yet been found . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first domestic europe sars case confirmed the first domestic european sars case was confirmed by the british department of health monday night , as a german firm begins delivering a new high speed test for the virus .

the european commission on tuesday strengthened precautionary measures aimed at stopping a contagious bird virus that has already spread from the netherlands to belgium and claimed the life of a dutch veterinarian . commission officials in brussels banned the export of belgian poultry products throughout the european union and to other countries until friday .
over the weekend there were at least two new confirmed cases of the flu in belgium 's eastern limburg region .
the country has already slaughtered a quarter of a million birds to halt the disease . the avian flu spilled over into belgium from the netherlands , where it has devastated the poultry industry .
since the disease 's discovery in february , dutch farmers have culled 15 million birds out of a total population of 100 million . the export ban alone is costing the dutch poultry industry an estimated € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- a day . bird flu in victim 's lungs the dutch health ministry said on saturday that the flu had also caused the death of a dutch veterinarian .

he said he suspected that the veterinarian had also been infected with another virus , which weakened his immune system . but investigators in holland told new scientist magazine that large amounts of the bird flu had been found in the man 's lungs , but no other viruses that could have caused his death . dutch public health officials have also detected the illness in pigs on five farms in the gelder valley region , new scientist reported . the bird flu 's spread has caused concern that the poultry virus could spark an epidemic like severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which has hit several countries in asia and canada .

ullrich , 29 , as well known for his out of the saddle exploits as for his cycling prowess , humbled a generally modest field to secure a symbolic win in the 202.3 kilometer " around cologne " event , his first race in his home country since injuries and a drugs scandal sidelined the former tour de france winner .
riding for his new team team coast after falling out with the magenta-clad team telekom , the rostock-born cyclist dominated the last 53 kilometers alone , and almost two minutes ahead of his nearest challenger , former telekom teammate danilo hondo , to finish first in the 88th annual race .
a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .
miracle win " there are still miracles , " said ullrich after the race to the throng of jostling reporters , an indication of his standing despite his history of problems .
" i wanted to get a good start in germany , but certainly no one expected it to go as well as this .
i 'm incredibly happy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naughty boy .
ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .
the road to ullrich 's latest recovery began when he returned to training last november and continued in january of this year when he signed with coast .
he returned to racing earlier this month in the tour de la sarthe in france and took part in the tour of aragon in spain last week .
where his career goes from here is in his own hands but his quest for the pinnacles of the sport is as evident as ever before .
tour de france is the goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour champion lance armstrong .
" i 'm not interested in the problems in the past and those that may possibly be in front of me , " ullrich said .
" i 'm concentrating on my comeback .
the goal is the tour de france .
that 's where i want to see how far along i am against lance armstrong -lrb- four times tour winner , photo -rrb- .
my season high point could be the world championships in canada in the autumn . "
many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .
" i have n't yet had a lot of contact with the others -lrb- his fellow team coast riders -rrb- but do n't anticipate any problems there , " ullrich said .
" we were together for 12 days in spain ...
sure , there are some who are unhappy but we have to deflect that .
we are trying to keep the team together . "
but monday 's victory almost was n't such a happy return to his native land for ullrich and his new teammates .
team coast 's license was temporarily withdrawn by ruling body uci over non-payment of riders ' wages but it was returned to them last month before the uci confirmed last tuesday that the team had the right to compete until the end of the year .
team coast spokesman marcel wuest said the uci had received evidence that the riders had been paid .

as the most successful leaders of the greens , they secured representation of the environmental party in two successive german governments and scored the highest-ever result for the greens in a national election last fall .
despite their superlative success , the leadership duo fell victim to a party rule stipulating that senior officials in the green party hierarchy are not allowed to hold seats in germany 's parliament at the same time .
last december , those who wanted to scrap the rule failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority at a party congress .
it was the victory of a tiny but vocal group of green traditionalists who have become the party 's pacifist and environmental conscience at a time when pragmatism often seems to bury green principles .
reinhard bütikofer and green defense expert angelika beer are the current co-chairs of the party .
bütikofer himself does n't want to keep the old rule , but he has some understanding for those clinging to it .
" i can understand why some party members want to stick to this principle for the sake of balancing power within the party , " he said .
" but on the other hand , we have come to understand that curtailing power has never really worked . "
the obvious example is german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has been the undisputed party ruler for 10 years and the most powerful of all greens .
fischer finally got around to running for a party post only two years ago .
a compromise now , more than 43,000 green party members are set to cast votes on the divisive issue of separating the party leadership from party mandates in parliament .
the current leadership , however , has taken the sting out of previous resolutions that called for scrapping the rule altogether .
as a compromise , bütikofer and beer now propose that about one-third of the six member board of the greens should be allowed to have parliamentary mandates .
bütikofer said he believed party members would approve the change .
" i think this proposal will find a majority , " he said .
" at the last party congress , we were just eight votes short of a two-thirds majority .
i assume the vote will produce more or less the same result . "
but there 's a major difference this time around : only a simple majority will be required to approve the change .
neither bütikofer nor beer need fear for their posts : their successful predecessors , roth and kühn , have received better-paid mandates in the german parliament .
it 's highly unlikely they will seek to resume their roles managing the party .
the party will continue to collect ballots through may 13 , with a final result expected to be released on may 23 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens find new posts for former leaders after party rules forced them from their posts in december , former green party chiefs claudia roth and fritz kuhn have been assigned new positions .

" i can understand why some party members want to stick to this principle for the sake of balancing power within the party , " he said .
" but on the other hand , we have come to understand that curtailing power has never really worked . "
the obvious example is german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has been the undisputed party ruler for 10 years and the most powerful of all greens .
fischer finally got around to running for a party post only two years ago .
a compromise now , more than 43,000 green party members are set to cast votes on the divisive issue of separating the party leadership from party mandates in parliament .
the current leadership , however , has taken the sting out of previous resolutions that called for scrapping the rule altogether .
as a compromise , bütikofer and beer now propose that about one-third of the six member board of the greens should be allowed to have parliamentary mandates .
bütikofer said he believed party members would approve the change .
" i think this proposal will find a majority , " he said .
" at the last party congress , we were just eight votes short of a two-thirds majority .
i assume the vote will produce more or less the same result . "
but there 's a major difference this time around : only a simple majority will be required to approve the change .
neither bütikofer nor beer need fear for their posts : their successful predecessors , roth and kühn , have received better-paid mandates in the german parliament .
it 's highly unlikely they will seek to resume their roles managing the party .

ullrich , 29 , as well known for his out of the saddle exploits as for his cycling prowess , humbled a generally modest field to secure a symbolic win in the 202.3 kilometer " around cologne " event , his first race in his home country since injuries and a drugs scandal sidelined the former tour de france winner .
riding for his new team team coast after falling out with the magenta-clad team telekom , the rostock-born cyclist dominated the last 53 kilometers alone , and almost two minutes ahead of his nearest challenger , former telekom teammate danilo hondo , to finish first in the 88th annual race .
a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .
miracle win " there are still miracles , " said ullrich after the race to the throng of jostling reporters , an indication of his standing despite his history of problems .
" i wanted to get a good start in germany , but certainly no one expected it to go as well as this .
i 'm incredibly happy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naughty boy .
ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .
the road to ullrich 's latest recovery began when he returned to training last november and continued in january of this year when he signed with coast .
he returned to racing earlier this month in the tour de la sarthe in france and took part in the tour of aragon in spain last week .
where his career goes from here is in his own hands but his quest for the pinnacles of the sport is as evident as ever before .
tour de france is the goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour champion lance armstrong .
" i 'm not interested in the problems in the past and those that may possibly be in front of me , " ullrich said .
" i 'm concentrating on my comeback .
the goal is the tour de france .
that 's where i want to see how far along i am against lance armstrong -lrb- four times tour winner , photo -rrb- .
my season high point could be the world championships in canada in the autumn . "
many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .
" i have n't yet had a lot of contact with the others -lrb- his fellow team coast riders -rrb- but do n't anticipate any problems there , " ullrich said .
" we were together for 12 days in spain ...
sure , there are some who are unhappy but we have to deflect that .
we are trying to keep the team together . "
but monday 's victory almost was n't such a happy return to his native land for ullrich and his new teammates .
team coast 's license was temporarily withdrawn by ruling body uci over non-payment of riders ' wages but it was returned to them last month before the uci confirmed last tuesday that the team had the right to compete until the end of the year .
team coast spokesman marcel wuest said the uci had received evidence that the riders had been paid .
he added that the team was considering legal action to seek compensation send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jan ullrich quits team telekom former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .

the european commission on tuesday strengthened precautionary measures aimed at stopping a contagious bird virus that has already spread from the netherlands to belgium and claimed the life of a dutch veterinarian . commission officials in brussels banned the export of belgian poultry products throughout the european union and to other countries until friday .
over the weekend there were at least two new confirmed cases of the flu in belgium 's eastern limburg region .
the country has already slaughtered a quarter of a million birds to halt the disease . the avian flu spilled over into belgium from the netherlands , where it has devastated the poultry industry .
since the disease 's discovery in february , dutch farmers have culled 15 million birds out of a total population of 100 million . the export ban alone is costing the dutch poultry industry an estimated € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- a day . bird flu in victim 's lungs the dutch health ministry said on saturday that the flu had also caused the death of a dutch veterinarian .
the 57-year-old man died on thursday after catching pneumonia two days after working on a farm where bird flu infections had been discovered . “ the severity of this case is surprising , but similar instances are to be expected , ” uwe truyen from the university of leipzig told the german press agency dpa .
he said he suspected that the veterinarian had also been infected with another virus , which weakened his immune system . but investigators in holland told new scientist magazine that large amounts of the bird flu had been found in the man 's lungs , but no other viruses that could have caused his death . dutch public health officials have also detected the illness in pigs on five farms in the gelder valley region , new scientist reported . the bird flu 's spread has caused concern that the poultry virus could spark an epidemic like severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which has hit several countries in asia and canada .
but officials from the world health organization said the bird flu had little in common with sars and there was no evidence that it could transfer to humans .
six people died in hong kong in 1997 from an outbreak of a bird virus . in holland , health officials also sought to assuage public fears the bird flu had mutated into something that could easily spread among humans .
" we now know there 's no mutation of the virus , we know for sure that the vet died of the original bird flu .
it 's very good to know that , " dutch health ministry spokesman bas kuik told the news agency reuters . governments encourage vaccinations both the dutch and belgian governments have stepped up human flu and bird flu vaccination efforts for workers who come into regular contact with fowl that could be affected by the illness .
in addition to the vet , some workers culling the birds have reported eye-infections and flu symptoms .
kuik even suggested on tuesday the vet 's death might have been prevented if he had obtained a vaccination . " if he had taken his anti-virals he probably would n't have died , " kuik told reuters . in germany , small groups of birds near the dutch and belgian borders have been culled as a precaution , but no confirmed cases have yet been found . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first domestic europe sars case confirmed the first domestic european sars case was confirmed by the british department of health monday night , as a german firm begins delivering a new high speed test for the virus .

a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .

ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .
the road to ullrich 's latest recovery began when he returned to training last november and continued in january of this year when he signed with coast .
he returned to racing earlier this month in the tour de la sarthe in france and took part in the tour of aragon in spain last week .

many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .
" i have n't yet had a lot of contact with the others -lrb- his fellow team coast riders -rrb- but do n't anticipate any problems there , " ullrich said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.04.2003 greens to vote on party change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding steady at the helm : the greens ' reinhard bütikofer and angelika beer after losing the two party chiefs who stewarded the greens to their best election results ever last year , members of the party are now voting on a major change to their charter . the credentials of former green party leaders claudia roth and fritz kühn are impressive .
as the most successful leaders of the greens , they secured representation of the environmental party in two successive german governments and scored the highest-ever result for the greens in a national election last fall .
despite their superlative success , the leadership duo fell victim to a party rule stipulating that senior officials in the green party hierarchy are not allowed to hold seats in germany 's parliament at the same time .
last december , those who wanted to scrap the rule failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority at a party congress .
it was the victory of a tiny but vocal group of green traditionalists who have become the party 's pacifist and environmental conscience at a time when pragmatism often seems to bury green principles .
reinhard bütikofer and green defense expert angelika beer are the current co-chairs of the party .
bütikofer himself does n't want to keep the old rule , but he has some understanding for those clinging to it .
" i can understand why some party members want to stick to this principle for the sake of balancing power within the party , " he said .
" but on the other hand , we have come to understand that curtailing power has never really worked . "
the obvious example is german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has been the undisputed party ruler for 10 years and the most powerful of all greens .
fischer finally got around to running for a party post only two years ago .
a compromise now , more than 43,000 green party members are set to cast votes on the divisive issue of separating the party leadership from party mandates in parliament .
the current leadership , however , has taken the sting out of previous resolutions that called for scrapping the rule altogether .
as a compromise , bütikofer and beer now propose that about one-third of the six member board of the greens should be allowed to have parliamentary mandates .
bütikofer said he believed party members would approve the change .
" i think this proposal will find a majority , " he said .
" at the last party congress , we were just eight votes short of a two-thirds majority .
i assume the vote will produce more or less the same result . "
but there 's a major difference this time around : only a simple majority will be required to approve the change .
neither bütikofer nor beer need fear for their posts : their successful predecessors , roth and kühn , have received better-paid mandates in the german parliament .
it 's highly unlikely they will seek to resume their roles managing the party .
the party will continue to collect ballots through may 13 , with a final result expected to be released on may 23 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens find new posts for former leaders after party rules forced them from their posts in december , former green party chiefs claudia roth and fritz kuhn have been assigned new positions .

the european commission on tuesday strengthened precautionary measures aimed at stopping a contagious bird virus that has already spread from the netherlands to belgium and claimed the life of a dutch veterinarian . commission officials in brussels banned the export of belgian poultry products throughout the european union and to other countries until friday .
over the weekend there were at least two new confirmed cases of the flu in belgium 's eastern limburg region .

ullrich , 29 , as well known for his out of the saddle exploits as for his cycling prowess , humbled a generally modest field to secure a symbolic win in the 202.3 kilometer " around cologne " event , his first race in his home country since injuries and a drugs scandal sidelined the former tour de france winner .

a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .
miracle win " there are still miracles , " said ullrich after the race to the throng of jostling reporters , an indication of his standing despite his history of problems .
" i wanted to get a good start in germany , but certainly no one expected it to go as well as this .
i 'm incredibly happy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naughty boy .
ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .
the road to ullrich 's latest recovery began when he returned to training last november and continued in january of this year when he signed with coast .
he returned to racing earlier this month in the tour de la sarthe in france and took part in the tour of aragon in spain last week .
where his career goes from here is in his own hands but his quest for the pinnacles of the sport is as evident as ever before .
tour de france is the goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour champion lance armstrong .
" i 'm not interested in the problems in the past and those that may possibly be in front of me , " ullrich said .
" i 'm concentrating on my comeback .
the goal is the tour de france .
that 's where i want to see how far along i am against lance armstrong -lrb- four times tour winner , photo -rrb- .
my season high point could be the world championships in canada in the autumn . "
many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .
" i have n't yet had a lot of contact with the others -lrb- his fellow team coast riders -rrb- but do n't anticipate any problems there , " ullrich said .
" we were together for 12 days in spain ...
sure , there are some who are unhappy but we have to deflect that .
we are trying to keep the team together . "
but monday 's victory almost was n't such a happy return to his native land for ullrich and his new teammates .
team coast 's license was temporarily withdrawn by ruling body uci over non-payment of riders ' wages but it was returned to them last month before the uci confirmed last tuesday that the team had the right to compete until the end of the year .
team coast spokesman marcel wuest said the uci had received evidence that the riders had been paid .

he returned to racing earlier this month in the tour de la sarthe in france and took part in the tour of aragon in spain last week .
where his career goes from here is in his own hands but his quest for the pinnacles of the sport is as evident as ever before .

that 's where i want to see how far along i am against lance armstrong -lrb- four times tour winner , photo -rrb- .
my season high point could be the world championships in canada in the autumn . "
many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .
" i have n't yet had a lot of contact with the others -lrb- his fellow team coast riders -rrb- but do n't anticipate any problems there , " ullrich said .
" we were together for 12 days in spain ...

we are trying to keep the team together . "

team coast 's license was temporarily withdrawn by ruling body uci over non-payment of riders ' wages but it was returned to them last month before the uci confirmed last tuesday that the team had the right to compete until the end of the year .

ullrich , 29 , as well known for his out of the saddle exploits as for his cycling prowess , humbled a generally modest field to secure a symbolic win in the 202.3 kilometer " around cologne " event , his first race in his home country since injuries and a drugs scandal sidelined the former tour de france winner .
riding for his new team team coast after falling out with the magenta-clad team telekom , the rostock-born cyclist dominated the last 53 kilometers alone , and almost two minutes ahead of his nearest challenger , former telekom teammate danilo hondo , to finish first in the 88th annual race .
a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .
miracle win " there are still miracles , " said ullrich after the race to the throng of jostling reporters , an indication of his standing despite his history of problems .
" i wanted to get a good start in germany , but certainly no one expected it to go as well as this .
i 'm incredibly happy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naughty boy .
ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .
the road to ullrich 's latest recovery began when he returned to training last november and continued in january of this year when he signed with coast .

as the most successful leaders of the greens , they secured representation of the environmental party in two successive german governments and scored the highest-ever result for the greens in a national election last fall .
despite their superlative success , the leadership duo fell victim to a party rule stipulating that senior officials in the green party hierarchy are not allowed to hold seats in germany 's parliament at the same time .
last december , those who wanted to scrap the rule failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority at a party congress .
it was the victory of a tiny but vocal group of green traditionalists who have become the party 's pacifist and environmental conscience at a time when pragmatism often seems to bury green principles .
reinhard bütikofer and green defense expert angelika beer are the current co-chairs of the party .
bütikofer himself does n't want to keep the old rule , but he has some understanding for those clinging to it .
" i can understand why some party members want to stick to this principle for the sake of balancing power within the party , " he said .
" but on the other hand , we have come to understand that curtailing power has never really worked . "
the obvious example is german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has been the undisputed party ruler for 10 years and the most powerful of all greens .
fischer finally got around to running for a party post only two years ago .
a compromise now , more than 43,000 green party members are set to cast votes on the divisive issue of separating the party leadership from party mandates in parliament .
the current leadership , however , has taken the sting out of previous resolutions that called for scrapping the rule altogether .
as a compromise , bütikofer and beer now propose that about one-third of the six member board of the greens should be allowed to have parliamentary mandates .
bütikofer said he believed party members would approve the change .
" i think this proposal will find a majority , " he said .
" at the last party congress , we were just eight votes short of a two-thirds majority .
i assume the vote will produce more or less the same result . "
but there 's a major difference this time around : only a simple majority will be required to approve the change .
neither bütikofer nor beer need fear for their posts : their successful predecessors , roth and kühn , have received better-paid mandates in the german parliament .
it 's highly unlikely they will seek to resume their roles managing the party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 22.04.2003 europe increases measures to halt bird flu großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgian and dutch poultry exports have been banned .
the european commission on tuesday strengthened precautionary measures aimed at stopping a contagious bird virus that has already spread from the netherlands to belgium and claimed the life of a dutch veterinarian . commission officials in brussels banned the export of belgian poultry products throughout the european union and to other countries until friday .
over the weekend there were at least two new confirmed cases of the flu in belgium 's eastern limburg region .
the country has already slaughtered a quarter of a million birds to halt the disease . the avian flu spilled over into belgium from the netherlands , where it has devastated the poultry industry .
since the disease 's discovery in february , dutch farmers have culled 15 million birds out of a total population of 100 million . the export ban alone is costing the dutch poultry industry an estimated € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- a day . bird flu in victim 's lungs the dutch health ministry said on saturday that the flu had also caused the death of a dutch veterinarian .
the 57-year-old man died on thursday after catching pneumonia two days after working on a farm where bird flu infections had been discovered . “ the severity of this case is surprising , but similar instances are to be expected , ” uwe truyen from the university of leipzig told the german press agency dpa .
he said he suspected that the veterinarian had also been infected with another virus , which weakened his immune system . but investigators in holland told new scientist magazine that large amounts of the bird flu had been found in the man 's lungs , but no other viruses that could have caused his death . dutch public health officials have also detected the illness in pigs on five farms in the gelder valley region , new scientist reported . the bird flu 's spread has caused concern that the poultry virus could spark an epidemic like severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which has hit several countries in asia and canada .
but officials from the world health organization said the bird flu had little in common with sars and there was no evidence that it could transfer to humans .
six people died in hong kong in 1997 from an outbreak of a bird virus . in holland , health officials also sought to assuage public fears the bird flu had mutated into something that could easily spread among humans .
" we now know there 's no mutation of the virus , we know for sure that the vet died of the original bird flu .
it 's very good to know that , " dutch health ministry spokesman bas kuik told the news agency reuters . governments encourage vaccinations both the dutch and belgian governments have stepped up human flu and bird flu vaccination efforts for workers who come into regular contact with fowl that could be affected by the illness .
in addition to the vet , some workers culling the birds have reported eye-infections and flu symptoms .
kuik even suggested on tuesday the vet 's death might have been prevented if he had obtained a vaccination . " if he had taken his anti-virals he probably would n't have died , " kuik told reuters . in germany , small groups of birds near the dutch and belgian borders have been culled as a precaution , but no confirmed cases have yet been found . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first domestic europe sars case confirmed the first domestic european sars case was confirmed by the british department of health monday night , as a german firm begins delivering a new high speed test for the virus .

ullrich , 29 , as well known for his out of the saddle exploits as for his cycling prowess , humbled a generally modest field to secure a symbolic win in the 202.3 kilometer " around cologne " event , his first race in his home country since injuries and a drugs scandal sidelined the former tour de france winner .
riding for his new team team coast after falling out with the magenta-clad team telekom , the rostock-born cyclist dominated the last 53 kilometers alone , and almost two minutes ahead of his nearest challenger , former telekom teammate danilo hondo , to finish first in the 88th annual race .
a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .
miracle win " there are still miracles , " said ullrich after the race to the throng of jostling reporters , an indication of his standing despite his history of problems .
" i wanted to get a good start in germany , but certainly no one expected it to go as well as this .
i 'm incredibly happy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naughty boy .
ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .
the road to ullrich 's latest recovery began when he returned to training last november and continued in january of this year when he signed with coast .
he returned to racing earlier this month in the tour de la sarthe in france and took part in the tour of aragon in spain last week .
where his career goes from here is in his own hands but his quest for the pinnacles of the sport is as evident as ever before .
tour de france is the goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour champion lance armstrong .
" i 'm not interested in the problems in the past and those that may possibly be in front of me , " ullrich said .
" i 'm concentrating on my comeback .
the goal is the tour de france .
that 's where i want to see how far along i am against lance armstrong -lrb- four times tour winner , photo -rrb- .
my season high point could be the world championships in canada in the autumn . "
many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .
" i have n't yet had a lot of contact with the others -lrb- his fellow team coast riders -rrb- but do n't anticipate any problems there , " ullrich said .
" we were together for 12 days in spain ...
sure , there are some who are unhappy but we have to deflect that .
we are trying to keep the team together . "
but monday 's victory almost was n't such a happy return to his native land for ullrich and his new teammates .
team coast 's license was temporarily withdrawn by ruling body uci over non-payment of riders ' wages but it was returned to them last month before the uci confirmed last tuesday that the team had the right to compete until the end of the year .
team coast spokesman marcel wuest said the uci had received evidence that the riders had been paid .
he added that the team was considering legal action to seek compensation send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jan ullrich quits team telekom former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .

riding for his new team team coast after falling out with the magenta-clad team telekom , the rostock-born cyclist dominated the last 53 kilometers alone , and almost two minutes ahead of his nearest challenger , former telekom teammate danilo hondo , to finish first in the 88th annual race .
a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .
miracle win " there are still miracles , " said ullrich after the race to the throng of jostling reporters , an indication of his standing despite his history of problems .
" i wanted to get a good start in germany , but certainly no one expected it to go as well as this .

ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .

it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .

my season high point could be the world championships in canada in the autumn . "
many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .
" i have n't yet had a lot of contact with the others -lrb- his fellow team coast riders -rrb- but do n't anticipate any problems there , " ullrich said .
" we were together for 12 days in spain ...

the european commission on tuesday strengthened precautionary measures aimed at stopping a contagious bird virus that has already spread from the netherlands to belgium and claimed the life of a dutch veterinarian . commission officials in brussels banned the export of belgian poultry products throughout the european union and to other countries until friday .
over the weekend there were at least two new confirmed cases of the flu in belgium 's eastern limburg region .
the country has already slaughtered a quarter of a million birds to halt the disease . the avian flu spilled over into belgium from the netherlands , where it has devastated the poultry industry .
since the disease 's discovery in february , dutch farmers have culled 15 million birds out of a total population of 100 million . the export ban alone is costing the dutch poultry industry an estimated € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- a day . bird flu in victim 's lungs the dutch health ministry said on saturday that the flu had also caused the death of a dutch veterinarian .
the 57-year-old man died on thursday after catching pneumonia two days after working on a farm where bird flu infections had been discovered . “ the severity of this case is surprising , but similar instances are to be expected , ” uwe truyen from the university of leipzig told the german press agency dpa .
he said he suspected that the veterinarian had also been infected with another virus , which weakened his immune system . but investigators in holland told new scientist magazine that large amounts of the bird flu had been found in the man 's lungs , but no other viruses that could have caused his death . dutch public health officials have also detected the illness in pigs on five farms in the gelder valley region , new scientist reported . the bird flu 's spread has caused concern that the poultry virus could spark an epidemic like severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which has hit several countries in asia and canada .
but officials from the world health organization said the bird flu had little in common with sars and there was no evidence that it could transfer to humans .
six people died in hong kong in 1997 from an outbreak of a bird virus . in holland , health officials also sought to assuage public fears the bird flu had mutated into something that could easily spread among humans .
" we now know there 's no mutation of the virus , we know for sure that the vet died of the original bird flu .
it 's very good to know that , " dutch health ministry spokesman bas kuik told the news agency reuters . governments encourage vaccinations both the dutch and belgian governments have stepped up human flu and bird flu vaccination efforts for workers who come into regular contact with fowl that could be affected by the illness .
in addition to the vet , some workers culling the birds have reported eye-infections and flu symptoms .
kuik even suggested on tuesday the vet 's death might have been prevented if he had obtained a vaccination . " if he had taken his anti-virals he probably would n't have died , " kuik told reuters . in germany , small groups of birds near the dutch and belgian borders have been culled as a precaution , but no confirmed cases have yet been found . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first domestic europe sars case confirmed the first domestic european sars case was confirmed by the british department of health monday night , as a german firm begins delivering a new high speed test for the virus .

the european commission on tuesday strengthened precautionary measures aimed at stopping a contagious bird virus that has already spread from the netherlands to belgium and claimed the life of a dutch veterinarian . commission officials in brussels banned the export of belgian poultry products throughout the european union and to other countries until friday .
over the weekend there were at least two new confirmed cases of the flu in belgium 's eastern limburg region .
the country has already slaughtered a quarter of a million birds to halt the disease . the avian flu spilled over into belgium from the netherlands , where it has devastated the poultry industry .
since the disease 's discovery in february , dutch farmers have culled 15 million birds out of a total population of 100 million . the export ban alone is costing the dutch poultry industry an estimated € 2 million -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- a day . bird flu in victim 's lungs the dutch health ministry said on saturday that the flu had also caused the death of a dutch veterinarian .
the 57-year-old man died on thursday after catching pneumonia two days after working on a farm where bird flu infections had been discovered . “ the severity of this case is surprising , but similar instances are to be expected , ” uwe truyen from the university of leipzig told the german press agency dpa .
he said he suspected that the veterinarian had also been infected with another virus , which weakened his immune system . but investigators in holland told new scientist magazine that large amounts of the bird flu had been found in the man 's lungs , but no other viruses that could have caused his death . dutch public health officials have also detected the illness in pigs on five farms in the gelder valley region , new scientist reported . the bird flu 's spread has caused concern that the poultry virus could spark an epidemic like severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- , which has hit several countries in asia and canada .
but officials from the world health organization said the bird flu had little in common with sars and there was no evidence that it could transfer to humans .
six people died in hong kong in 1997 from an outbreak of a bird virus . in holland , health officials also sought to assuage public fears the bird flu had mutated into something that could easily spread among humans .
" we now know there 's no mutation of the virus , we know for sure that the vet died of the original bird flu .
it 's very good to know that , " dutch health ministry spokesman bas kuik told the news agency reuters . governments encourage vaccinations both the dutch and belgian governments have stepped up human flu and bird flu vaccination efforts for workers who come into regular contact with fowl that could be affected by the illness .
in addition to the vet , some workers culling the birds have reported eye-infections and flu symptoms .
kuik even suggested on tuesday the vet 's death might have been prevented if he had obtained a vaccination . " if he had taken his anti-virals he probably would n't have died , " kuik told reuters . in germany , small groups of birds near the dutch and belgian borders have been culled as a precaution , but no confirmed cases have yet been found . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de first domestic europe sars case confirmed the first domestic european sars case was confirmed by the british department of health monday night , as a german firm begins delivering a new high speed test for the virus .

as the most successful leaders of the greens , they secured representation of the environmental party in two successive german governments and scored the highest-ever result for the greens in a national election last fall .
despite their superlative success , the leadership duo fell victim to a party rule stipulating that senior officials in the green party hierarchy are not allowed to hold seats in germany 's parliament at the same time .
last december , those who wanted to scrap the rule failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority at a party congress .
it was the victory of a tiny but vocal group of green traditionalists who have become the party 's pacifist and environmental conscience at a time when pragmatism often seems to bury green principles .
reinhard bütikofer and green defense expert angelika beer are the current co-chairs of the party .
bütikofer himself does n't want to keep the old rule , but he has some understanding for those clinging to it .
" i can understand why some party members want to stick to this principle for the sake of balancing power within the party , " he said .
" but on the other hand , we have come to understand that curtailing power has never really worked . "
the obvious example is german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has been the undisputed party ruler for 10 years and the most powerful of all greens .
fischer finally got around to running for a party post only two years ago .
a compromise now , more than 43,000 green party members are set to cast votes on the divisive issue of separating the party leadership from party mandates in parliament .
the current leadership , however , has taken the sting out of previous resolutions that called for scrapping the rule altogether .
as a compromise , bütikofer and beer now propose that about one-third of the six member board of the greens should be allowed to have parliamentary mandates .
bütikofer said he believed party members would approve the change .
" i think this proposal will find a majority , " he said .
" at the last party congress , we were just eight votes short of a two-thirds majority .
i assume the vote will produce more or less the same result . "
but there 's a major difference this time around : only a simple majority will be required to approve the change .
neither bütikofer nor beer need fear for their posts : their successful predecessors , roth and kühn , have received better-paid mandates in the german parliament .
it 's highly unlikely they will seek to resume their roles managing the party .

ullrich , 29 , as well known for his out of the saddle exploits as for his cycling prowess , humbled a generally modest field to secure a symbolic win in the 202.3 kilometer " around cologne " event , his first race in his home country since injuries and a drugs scandal sidelined the former tour de france winner .
riding for his new team team coast after falling out with the magenta-clad team telekom , the rostock-born cyclist dominated the last 53 kilometers alone , and almost two minutes ahead of his nearest challenger , former telekom teammate danilo hondo , to finish first in the 88th annual race .
a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .
miracle win " there are still miracles , " said ullrich after the race to the throng of jostling reporters , an indication of his standing despite his history of problems .
" i wanted to get a good start in germany , but certainly no one expected it to go as well as this .
i 'm incredibly happy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naughty boy .
ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .
the road to ullrich 's latest recovery began when he returned to training last november and continued in january of this year when he signed with coast .
he returned to racing earlier this month in the tour de la sarthe in france and took part in the tour of aragon in spain last week .
where his career goes from here is in his own hands but his quest for the pinnacles of the sport is as evident as ever before .
tour de france is the goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour champion lance armstrong .
" i 'm not interested in the problems in the past and those that may possibly be in front of me , " ullrich said .

the goal is the tour de france .
that 's where i want to see how far along i am against lance armstrong -lrb- four times tour winner , photo -rrb- .
my season high point could be the world championships in canada in the autumn . "
many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .
" i have n't yet had a lot of contact with the others -lrb- his fellow team coast riders -rrb- but do n't anticipate any problems there , " ullrich said .
" we were together for 12 days in spain ...
sure , there are some who are unhappy but we have to deflect that .
we are trying to keep the team together . "
but monday 's victory almost was n't such a happy return to his native land for ullrich and his new teammates .
team coast 's license was temporarily withdrawn by ruling body uci over non-payment of riders ' wages but it was returned to them last month before the uci confirmed last tuesday that the team had the right to compete until the end of the year .
team coast spokesman marcel wuest said the uci had received evidence that the riders had been paid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.04.2003 greens to vote on party change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holding steady at the helm : the greens ' reinhard bütikofer and angelika beer after losing the two party chiefs who stewarded the greens to their best election results ever last year , members of the party are now voting on a major change to their charter . the credentials of former green party leaders claudia roth and fritz kühn are impressive .
as the most successful leaders of the greens , they secured representation of the environmental party in two successive german governments and scored the highest-ever result for the greens in a national election last fall .
despite their superlative success , the leadership duo fell victim to a party rule stipulating that senior officials in the green party hierarchy are not allowed to hold seats in germany 's parliament at the same time .
last december , those who wanted to scrap the rule failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority at a party congress .
it was the victory of a tiny but vocal group of green traditionalists who have become the party 's pacifist and environmental conscience at a time when pragmatism often seems to bury green principles .
reinhard bütikofer and green defense expert angelika beer are the current co-chairs of the party .
bütikofer himself does n't want to keep the old rule , but he has some understanding for those clinging to it .
" i can understand why some party members want to stick to this principle for the sake of balancing power within the party , " he said .
" but on the other hand , we have come to understand that curtailing power has never really worked . "
the obvious example is german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has been the undisputed party ruler for 10 years and the most powerful of all greens .
fischer finally got around to running for a party post only two years ago .
a compromise now , more than 43,000 green party members are set to cast votes on the divisive issue of separating the party leadership from party mandates in parliament .
the current leadership , however , has taken the sting out of previous resolutions that called for scrapping the rule altogether .
as a compromise , bütikofer and beer now propose that about one-third of the six member board of the greens should be allowed to have parliamentary mandates .
bütikofer said he believed party members would approve the change .
" i think this proposal will find a majority , " he said .
" at the last party congress , we were just eight votes short of a two-thirds majority .
i assume the vote will produce more or less the same result . "
but there 's a major difference this time around : only a simple majority will be required to approve the change .
neither bütikofer nor beer need fear for their posts : their successful predecessors , roth and kühn , have received better-paid mandates in the german parliament .
it 's highly unlikely they will seek to resume their roles managing the party .
the party will continue to collect ballots through may 13 , with a final result expected to be released on may 23 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens find new posts for former leaders after party rules forced them from their posts in december , former green party chiefs claudia roth and fritz kuhn have been assigned new positions .

as the most successful leaders of the greens , they secured representation of the environmental party in two successive german governments and scored the highest-ever result for the greens in a national election last fall .
despite their superlative success , the leadership duo fell victim to a party rule stipulating that senior officials in the green party hierarchy are not allowed to hold seats in germany 's parliament at the same time .
last december , those who wanted to scrap the rule failed to get the necessary two-thirds majority at a party congress .
it was the victory of a tiny but vocal group of green traditionalists who have become the party 's pacifist and environmental conscience at a time when pragmatism often seems to bury green principles .
reinhard bütikofer and green defense expert angelika beer are the current co-chairs of the party .
bütikofer himself does n't want to keep the old rule , but he has some understanding for those clinging to it .
" i can understand why some party members want to stick to this principle for the sake of balancing power within the party , " he said .
" but on the other hand , we have come to understand that curtailing power has never really worked . "
the obvious example is german foreign minister joschka fischer , who has been the undisputed party ruler for 10 years and the most powerful of all greens .
fischer finally got around to running for a party post only two years ago .
a compromise now , more than 43,000 green party members are set to cast votes on the divisive issue of separating the party leadership from party mandates in parliament .
the current leadership , however , has taken the sting out of previous resolutions that called for scrapping the rule altogether .
as a compromise , bütikofer and beer now propose that about one-third of the six member board of the greens should be allowed to have parliamentary mandates .
bütikofer said he believed party members would approve the change .
" i think this proposal will find a majority , " he said .
" at the last party congress , we were just eight votes short of a two-thirds majority .
i assume the vote will produce more or less the same result . "
but there 's a major difference this time around : only a simple majority will be required to approve the change .
neither bütikofer nor beer need fear for their posts : their successful predecessors , roth and kühn , have received better-paid mandates in the german parliament .
it 's highly unlikely they will seek to resume their roles managing the party .

ullrich , 29 , as well known for his out of the saddle exploits as for his cycling prowess , humbled a generally modest field to secure a symbolic win in the 202.3 kilometer " around cologne " event , his first race in his home country since injuries and a drugs scandal sidelined the former tour de france winner .

a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .

ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .
the road to ullrich 's latest recovery began when he returned to training last november and continued in january of this year when he signed with coast .
he returned to racing earlier this month in the tour de la sarthe in france and took part in the tour of aragon in spain last week .

many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .

ullrich , 29 , as well known for his out of the saddle exploits as for his cycling prowess , humbled a generally modest field to secure a symbolic win in the 202.3 kilometer " around cologne " event , his first race in his home country since injuries and a drugs scandal sidelined the former tour de france winner .
riding for his new team team coast after falling out with the magenta-clad team telekom , the rostock-born cyclist dominated the last 53 kilometers alone , and almost two minutes ahead of his nearest challenger , former telekom teammate danilo hondo , to finish first in the 88th annual race .
a crowd of more than a million race fans cheered ullrich 's every perambulation as he repeatedly attacked before his final breakaway .
miracle win " there are still miracles , " said ullrich after the race to the throng of jostling reporters , an indication of his standing despite his history of problems .
" i wanted to get a good start in germany , but certainly no one expected it to go as well as this .
i 'm incredibly happy . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naughty boy .
ullrich , the winner of the 1997 tour de france , last raced more than 15 months ago - an enforced hiatus caused by recurring knee problems , operations and that scandal .
he very publicly tested positive for amphetamines last june and admitted that he had taken pills at a nightclub during a " personal crisis , " thought to have developed from a dismal season blighted by injuries .
he was subsequently banned from racing for six months , a ban that ended in march .
last victory in 2001 his last race in germany was the tour of rhineland-palatinate in september 2001 .
it was his first cycling victory since winning the time trial on october 11 , 2001 at the world championships in lisbon .
but his meteoric rise to the top of his sport aptly went downhill after that and he parted company with team telekom in acrimony and disgrace .
the road to ullrich 's latest recovery began when he returned to training last november and continued in january of this year when he signed with coast .
he returned to racing earlier this month in the tour de la sarthe in france and took part in the tour of aragon in spain last week .
where his career goes from here is in his own hands but his quest for the pinnacles of the sport is as evident as ever before .
tour de france is the goal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour champion lance armstrong .
" i 'm not interested in the problems in the past and those that may possibly be in front of me , " ullrich said .
" i 'm concentrating on my comeback .
the goal is the tour de france .
that 's where i want to see how far along i am against lance armstrong -lrb- four times tour winner , photo -rrb- .
my season high point could be the world championships in canada in the autumn . "
many regard ullrich as the only man capable of breaking texan armstrong 's stranglehold on the tour de france , the world 's greatest cycle race .
" it was obvious to see that jan is feeling good , " said ullrich 's new team manager wolfgang strohband as coast celebrated the victory in germany 's fourth largest city .
there was no talk of the rider 's well-known ability to cause friction between himself and his teammates through his reputation , financial demands and personality .
" i have n't yet had a lot of contact with the others -lrb- his fellow team coast riders -rrb- but do n't anticipate any problems there , " ullrich said .
" we were together for 12 days in spain ...
sure , there are some who are unhappy but we have to deflect that .
we are trying to keep the team together . "
but monday 's victory almost was n't such a happy return to his native land for ullrich and his new teammates .
team coast 's license was temporarily withdrawn by ruling body uci over non-payment of riders ' wages but it was returned to them last month before the uci confirmed last tuesday that the team had the right to compete until the end of the year .
team coast spokesman marcel wuest said the uci had received evidence that the riders had been paid .
he added that the team was considering legal action to seek compensation send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de jan ullrich quits team telekom former tour de france winner jan ullrich , serving a temporary drug ban by german cycling , has decided to part company with german cycling outfit team telekom .

a decade ago , teenager stephen lawrence was stabbed to death near to his home in eltham , south london .
the metropolitan police launched a murder inquiry but failed to bring the killers to justice .
the family doggedly pursued the case and eventually five young men were identified as suspects .
a private prosecution of three of the men by stephen 's parents failed and none of the five have ever been convicted in connection to his death .
after coming to power in 1997 , tony blair 's government launched a public inquiry into neville and doreen lawrence 's allegations .
what did the inquiry conclude ?
the macpherson inquiry became one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in britain .
it concluded that stephen lawrence had been failed by a police force infected with " institutional racism " .
" for too long the family and the public were led to think that the investigation had been satisfactorily carried out , " said the inquiry .
the inquiry team said institutional racism applies where there has been a " collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour , culture or ethnic origin . "
the inquiry also demanded the police categorise a crime as racist where the incident " is perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person , rather than their own conclusion .
what was the effect of the inquiry ?
sir william macpherson 's inquiry had an enormous impact on the race relations debate - from criminal justice through to all public authorities .
supporters of the lawrences saw the inquiry as confirming what they already suspected - that justice worked differently depending on the colour of your skin .
the aftermath of stephen lawrence 's murder marked a low-point in relations between ethnic minorities and the police in the uk , something which senior officers say they are still trying to rectify .
morale within the metropolitan police took a collective dip .
today the force is attempting to recruit more and more officers from non-white backgrounds and as of 2002 five officers in 100 were from minority communities .
critics say the force 's target of 7 % falls well below the true picture of london , which is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world .
at westminster , the government brought in the most sweeping change in race relations law in 25 years by putting a positive obligation on public bodies to promote equality and tackle discrimination .
but a lot of campaigners say the system is still failing minority communities .
why do they say that ?
the latest statistics show black people are eight times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people - even though only 10 % of these incidents lead to the police taking further action .
research into a specific area of stop and search powers reportedly suggests that afro-caribbean people are 27 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people .
black men are also disproportionately over-represented in the prison population compared to white men .
despite claimed advances by the metropolitan police , there was uproar from campaigners at how the force handled its investigation into the death of south london schoolboy damilola taylor .
what do the lawrences say ?
doreen lawrence recently said she believed the government had lost interest in race issues .
this had a knock-on effect where senior officers in the met were struggling to get their reforms taken seriously by officers on the beat .
she said she believed another family could go through the same trauma as hers if there were a similar racially-motivated murder .
" in some respects we are beginning to become a little more complacent again .
people think that we have had the inquiry and so everything 's fine , but it 's not .
there are lot of people still complaining about racist attacks , " said mrs lawrence .
what does the government say ?
on the eve of the tenth anniversary of stephen lawrence 's death , home office minister lord falconer said the damilola taylor case showed the legal system still had work to do .
" the tragedy of the lawrence story is not only the horror of stephen lawrence 's brutal and senseless murder but also the failure of the criminal justice system - the police , the crown prosecution service , the courts - to deliver justice to stephen and his family , " he said .

a decade ago , teenager stephen lawrence was stabbed to death near to his home in eltham , south london .
the metropolitan police launched a murder inquiry but failed to bring the killers to justice .
the family doggedly pursued the case and eventually five young men were identified as suspects .
a private prosecution of three of the men by stephen 's parents failed and none of the five have ever been convicted in connection to his death .
after coming to power in 1997 , tony blair 's government launched a public inquiry into neville and doreen lawrence 's allegations .
what did the inquiry conclude ?
the macpherson inquiry became one of the most important moments in the modern history of criminal justice in britain .
it concluded that stephen lawrence had been failed by a police force infected with " institutional racism " .
" for too long the family and the public were led to think that the investigation had been satisfactorily carried out , " said the inquiry .
the inquiry team said institutional racism applies where there has been a " collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour , culture or ethnic origin . "
the inquiry also demanded the police categorise a crime as racist where the incident " is perceived to be racist by the victim or any other person , rather than their own conclusion .
what was the effect of the inquiry ?
sir william macpherson 's inquiry had an enormous impact on the race relations debate - from criminal justice through to all public authorities .
supporters of the lawrences saw the inquiry as confirming what they already suspected - that justice worked differently depending on the colour of your skin .
the aftermath of stephen lawrence 's murder marked a low-point in relations between ethnic minorities and the police in the uk , something which senior officers say they are still trying to rectify .
morale within the metropolitan police took a collective dip .
today the force is attempting to recruit more and more officers from non-white backgrounds and as of 2002 five officers in 100 were from minority communities .
critics say the force 's target of 7 % falls well below the true picture of london , which is one of the most ethnically diverse cities in the world .
at westminster , the government brought in the most sweeping change in race relations law in 25 years by putting a positive obligation on public bodies to promote equality and tackle discrimination .
but a lot of campaigners say the system is still failing minority communities .
why do they say that ?
the latest statistics show black people are eight times more likely to be stopped and searched by police than white people - even though only 10 % of these incidents lead to the police taking further action .
research into a specific area of stop and search powers reportedly suggests that afro-caribbean people are 27 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people .
black men are also disproportionately over-represented in the prison population compared to white men .
despite claimed advances by the metropolitan police , there was uproar from campaigners at how the force handled its investigation into the death of south london schoolboy damilola taylor .
what do the lawrences say ?
doreen lawrence recently said she believed the government had lost interest in race issues .
this had a knock-on effect where senior officers in the met were struggling to get their reforms taken seriously by officers on the beat .
she said she believed another family could go through the same trauma as hers if there were a similar racially-motivated murder .
" in some respects we are beginning to become a little more complacent again .
people think that we have had the inquiry and so everything 's fine , but it 's not .
there are lot of people still complaining about racist attacks , " said mrs lawrence .

researchers at edinburgh university 's institute of cell and molecular biology said they have isolated part of a protein which allows the disease to become resistant to new treatments .
the team 's findings , which have been published in the journal nature structural biology , could lead to a new generation of drugs being designed to fight the condition .
malaria kills over a million people a year and is second only to tuberculosis in its impact on world health .
there are four main types of the disease , all spread via mosquitoes .
the most serious forms can affect the kidneys and brain and can cause anaemia , coma and death .
it is present in 90 countries and infects one in 10 of the world 's population - mainly those in sub-tropical climates .
the number of people dying from malaria is now higher than it was 30 years ago .
drug resistance a significant factor in this is thought to be the disease 's ability to become resistant to drug treatments .
scientists from edinburgh university have been working with the biotec institute in bangkok to study the protein responsible for drug resistance in malaria .
they said the key lies in a protein called dhfr , which the parasite produces to keep itself alive .
malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes tests using genetic engineering techniques have isolated the part of the protein which changes to protect itself against pyrimethamine - a chemical used in anti-malarial drugs .
professor malcolm walkinshaw , of edinburgh university , said : " we can now use this protein structure to design a new generation of drugs which makes it possible to overcome resistant strains of malaria .
" people have studied this protein for a long time , but until now , no one has been able to determine its detailed structure .
this is a real breakthrough .
" drug resistance is a major issue for all infectious diseases , not just malaria . "
the research has been funded by the wellcome trust , which hopes to use the findings to help develop medicines for people living in and travelling to regions afflicted by malaria .

malaria is transmitted by mosquitoes tests using genetic engineering techniques have isolated the part of the protein which changes to protect itself against pyrimethamine - a chemical used in anti-malarial drugs .
professor malcolm walkinshaw , of edinburgh university , said : " we can now use this protein structure to design a new generation of drugs which makes it possible to overcome resistant strains of malaria .
" people have studied this protein for a long time , but until now , no one has been able to determine its detailed structure .
this is a real breakthrough .
" drug resistance is a major issue for all infectious diseases , not just malaria . "
the research has been funded by the wellcome trust , which hopes to use the findings to help develop medicines for people living in and travelling to regions afflicted by malaria .

researchers at edinburgh university 's institute of cell and molecular biology said they have isolated part of a protein which allows the disease to become resistant to new treatments .
the team 's findings , which have been published in the journal nature structural biology , could lead to a new generation of drugs being designed to fight the condition .
malaria kills over a million people a year and is second only to tuberculosis in its impact on world health .
there are four main types of the disease , all spread via mosquitoes .
the most serious forms can affect the kidneys and brain and can cause anaemia , coma and death .
it is present in 90 countries and infects one in 10 of the world 's population - mainly those in sub-tropical climates .
the number of people dying from malaria is now higher than it was 30 years ago .
drug resistance a significant factor in this is thought to be the disease 's ability to become resistant to drug treatments .

research for sainsbury 's magazine found that more than half of all scots questioned were unhappy with their weight .
almost one in five of the respondents said that they were on a permanent diet .
three-quarters of those taking part in the survey admitted to being on a diet at least once - the highest proportion anywhere in britain .
the magazine survey said that 31 % of scots admitted to " yo-yo " dieting - going on a series of crash diets as their weight fluctuates .
it found that 19 % were constantly on a diet while 56 % said they were unhappy with their weight .
scots ' chocoholics ' the survey results suggested that scots have different eating and drinking habits to others in the uk .
it found that in general , scots drank less water than other britons and dine out least frequently .
of those questioned , 61 % said they eat out only once or twice a month compared to 22 % of londoners who visit restaurants more than once a week .
a further 44 % admitted to drinking just two or three glasses of water a day , compared to the 28 % of welsh people who consume six to seven glasses .
scots drink less water than some of their uk counterparts the results also suggest scots spent just 53 minutes preparing their traditional sunday roast dinner - about half the time that people from the south-east do .
scots also appear to be the biggest chocoholics with 33 % saying they ate chocolate regularly .
but the dietary trends do not , the survey suggests , point towards scots favouring food over some sorts of physical activity .
one finding suggested that only 25 % of scots rate good food better than good sex , compared to the 34 % of east anglians who preferred the culinary delights to those in the bedroom .
