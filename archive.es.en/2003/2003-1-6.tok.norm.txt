a guilty verdict on the charge of complicity , especially coming to close to duisenberg ’ s departure , could threaten trichet ’ s credibility .
the succession could also be thrown into question if the trial , which is expected to last six weeks , runs into delays . brilliant banker by most accounts , jean-claude trichet is well suited for the top job at the ecb .
he is considered one of the world ’ s brightest central bankers and enjoys a level respect among the financial community than wim duisenberg can only envy . many believe trichet should be the one in frankfurt anyway .
he was a hair ’ s breadth away from clinching the ecb job in 1998 when the german government expressed reservations about having a frenchman at the european economic helm .
a controversial compromise put the more neutral duisenberg in the top spot and stipulated that trichet would take over in 2003 . but in 2000 , a formal investigation began regarding in trichet ’ s role in the scandal at crédit lyonnais , the one-time state-owned bank whose troubles in the early 1990 ’ s .
a series of government bailouts in the years following cost french taxpayers more than 100 billion francs .
the bank was privatised in 1999 . in 1992 , the bank reported losses of 1.8 billion francs -lrb- euro -rrb- .
but prosecutors say the banks accounts , which were approved at the time by trichet , failed to reflect the billion of provisions against bad investments , hiding a loss in reality of nearly 7 billion francs . misleading accounting investigating magistrate phillip courroye argues that the accounts were deliberately understated so that crédit lyonnais would not break european rules on minimum solvency requirements for financial institutions . trichet ’ s lawyers counter that the charges of complicity against him are groundless .
they say he had no precise information over the actual state of the bank ’ s financial affairs nor the power to dictate what the bank reported in its statements . still , magistrates have unearthed a noted trichet wrote to the then finance minister in 1993 stating that “ publication of a bigger loss would have meant not respecting eu solvency laws and prompted questions about the solidity of europe ’ s leading financial institution . ” trichet stands accused with eight other leading french financial figures , including former crédit lyonnais president jean-yves haberer , jacques de larosière , one-time government of the bank of france , and jean-pascal beaufret , a treasury officials who is now cfo at the alcatel technology group . a verdict on the case has been promised before july . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the money maker goes the president of the european central bank , wim duisenberg , says he will cut short his tenure and step down in july 2003 .
the dutchman will most likely be replaced by a french national .

growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deadly future ?

air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deadly future ?
if it is proved that rising co2 levels are in some way protecting the trees , experts can only wonder at the widespread damage that will occur if this changes and the forests begin to show the catastrophic effects that have been predicted for the past 20 years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de i spy a lot of carbon dioxide with the launch of the carbon dioxide-measuring satellite envisat , europe makes its pitch as world leader in all things environmental .

a guilty verdict on the charge of complicity , especially coming to close to duisenberg ’ s departure , could threaten trichet ’ s credibility .
the succession could also be thrown into question if the trial , which is expected to last six weeks , runs into delays . brilliant banker by most accounts , jean-claude trichet is well suited for the top job at the ecb .
he is considered one of the world ’ s brightest central bankers and enjoys a level respect among the financial community than wim duisenberg can only envy . many believe trichet should be the one in frankfurt anyway .
he was a hair ’ s breadth away from clinching the ecb job in 1998 when the german government expressed reservations about having a frenchman at the european economic helm .
a controversial compromise put the more neutral duisenberg in the top spot and stipulated that trichet would take over in 2003 . but in 2000 , a formal investigation began regarding in trichet ’ s role in the scandal at crédit lyonnais , the one-time state-owned bank whose troubles in the early 1990 ’ s .
a series of government bailouts in the years following cost french taxpayers more than 100 billion francs .
the bank was privatised in 1999 . in 1992 , the bank reported losses of 1.8 billion francs -lrb- euro -rrb- .
but prosecutors say the banks accounts , which were approved at the time by trichet , failed to reflect the billion of provisions against bad investments , hiding a loss in reality of nearly 7 billion francs . misleading accounting investigating magistrate phillip courroye argues that the accounts were deliberately understated so that crédit lyonnais would not break european rules on minimum solvency requirements for financial institutions . trichet ’ s lawyers counter that the charges of complicity against him are groundless .
they say he had no precise information over the actual state of the bank ’ s financial affairs nor the power to dictate what the bank reported in its statements . still , magistrates have unearthed a noted trichet wrote to the then finance minister in 1993 stating that “ publication of a bigger loss would have meant not respecting eu solvency laws and prompted questions about the solidity of europe ’ s leading financial institution . ” trichet stands accused with eight other leading french financial figures , including former crédit lyonnais president jean-yves haberer , jacques de larosière , one-time government of the bank of france , and jean-pascal beaufret , a treasury officials who is now cfo at the alcatel technology group . a verdict on the case has been promised before july . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the money maker goes the president of the european central bank , wim duisenberg , says he will cut short his tenure and step down in july 2003 .

representatives of public-sector workers said they were prepared for a long walk-out . germany faced the possibility of the first national public-sector strike in more than a decade as four days of talks between the government and union negotiators ground to a halt on monday .
leaders of the verdi trade union , which represents some 2.8 million public transit workers , nurses , fire fighters and other public employees , said they were prepared for a long strike beginning later in january if no deal is reached at a new round of talks on wednesday .

growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deadly future ?
if it is proved that rising co2 levels are in some way protecting the trees , experts can only wonder at the widespread damage that will occur if this changes and the forests begin to show the catastrophic effects that have been predicted for the past 20 years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de i spy a lot of carbon dioxide with the launch of the carbon dioxide-measuring satellite envisat , europe makes its pitch as world leader in all things environmental .

growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deadly future ?
if it is proved that rising co2 levels are in some way protecting the trees , experts can only wonder at the widespread damage that will occur if this changes and the forests begin to show the catastrophic effects that have been predicted for the past 20 years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de i spy a lot of carbon dioxide with the launch of the carbon dioxide-measuring satellite envisat , europe makes its pitch as world leader in all things environmental .

representatives of public-sector workers said they were prepared for a long walk-out . germany faced the possibility of the first national public-sector strike in more than a decade as four days of talks between the government and union negotiators ground to a halt on monday .
leaders of the verdi trade union , which represents some 2.8 million public transit workers , nurses , fire fighters and other public employees , said they were prepared for a long strike beginning later in january if no deal is reached at a new round of talks on wednesday .
the government-appointed mediator , hinrich lehmann-grube , said employers could not accept a proposed compromise that called for wages to increase by 3 percent over the next year and a half .
employers countered with an offer of a 2.8 percent increase .
schily " moderately optimistic " " we are still willing to negotiate and i am moderately optimistic that we will come to an agreement on wednesday , " interior minister otto schily said in bremen , where the negotiations took place .
schily warned union members against a strike , saying that the government – already under severe financial pressure due to a sinking economy – would withdraw its latest offer in the case of a walk-out .
economists , meanwhile , noted that a strike could send germany 's weak economy back into a recession .
" pessimism could grow " " i could imagine the strikes to be the last straw , " rainer schmidt , labor market expert at the ifw economic institute told reuters .
" expectations are already pessimistic .
this pessimism could grow with strikes . "
indeed , union mediator hans koschnick urged the government to consider the price of a strike .
" if it comes to a strike , that will be much more expensive than what we have proposed , " he told german radio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.01.2003 european forests thriving in high ozone areas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are european trees protecting themselves from pollution ?
growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deadly future ?
if it is proved that rising co2 levels are in some way protecting the trees , experts can only wonder at the widespread damage that will occur if this changes and the forests begin to show the catastrophic effects that have been predicted for the past 20 years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de i spy a lot of carbon dioxide with the launch of the carbon dioxide-measuring satellite envisat , europe makes its pitch as world leader in all things environmental .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.01.2003 european forests thriving in high ozone areas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are european trees protecting themselves from pollution ?
growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deadly future ?
if it is proved that rising co2 levels are in some way protecting the trees , experts can only wonder at the widespread damage that will occur if this changes and the forests begin to show the catastrophic effects that have been predicted for the past 20 years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de i spy a lot of carbon dioxide with the launch of the carbon dioxide-measuring satellite envisat , europe makes its pitch as world leader in all things environmental .

representatives of public-sector workers said they were prepared for a long walk-out . germany faced the possibility of the first national public-sector strike in more than a decade as four days of talks between the government and union negotiators ground to a halt on monday .
leaders of the verdi trade union , which represents some 2.8 million public transit workers , nurses , fire fighters and other public employees , said they were prepared for a long strike beginning later in january if no deal is reached at a new round of talks on wednesday .
the government-appointed mediator , hinrich lehmann-grube , said employers could not accept a proposed compromise that called for wages to increase by 3 percent over the next year and a half .
employers countered with an offer of a 2.8 percent increase .
schily " moderately optimistic " " we are still willing to negotiate and i am moderately optimistic that we will come to an agreement on wednesday , " interior minister otto schily said in bremen , where the negotiations took place .
schily warned union members against a strike , saying that the government – already under severe financial pressure due to a sinking economy – would withdraw its latest offer in the case of a walk-out .
economists , meanwhile , noted that a strike could send germany 's weak economy back into a recession .
" pessimism could grow " " i could imagine the strikes to be the last straw , " rainer schmidt , labor market expert at the ifw economic institute told reuters .
" expectations are already pessimistic .
this pessimism could grow with strikes . "
indeed , union mediator hans koschnick urged the government to consider the price of a strike .
" if it comes to a strike , that will be much more expensive than what we have proposed , " he told german radio .
verdi has asked for a pay raise of 3 percent to be implemented in two phases over 18 months and for wages in the former east germany to equal those in the west by 2007 .
the last national public sector strike in germany was in 1992 .

however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deadly future ?
if it is proved that rising co2 levels are in some way protecting the trees , experts can only wonder at the widespread damage that will occur if this changes and the forests begin to show the catastrophic effects that have been predicted for the past 20 years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de i spy a lot of carbon dioxide with the launch of the carbon dioxide-measuring satellite envisat , europe makes its pitch as world leader in all things environmental .

representatives of public-sector workers said they were prepared for a long walk-out . germany faced the possibility of the first national public-sector strike in more than a decade as four days of talks between the government and union negotiators ground to a halt on monday .
leaders of the verdi trade union , which represents some 2.8 million public transit workers , nurses , fire fighters and other public employees , said they were prepared for a long strike beginning later in january if no deal is reached at a new round of talks on wednesday .
the government-appointed mediator , hinrich lehmann-grube , said employers could not accept a proposed compromise that called for wages to increase by 3 percent over the next year and a half .
employers countered with an offer of a 2.8 percent increase .
schily " moderately optimistic " " we are still willing to negotiate and i am moderately optimistic that we will come to an agreement on wednesday , " interior minister otto schily said in bremen , where the negotiations took place .
schily warned union members against a strike , saying that the government – already under severe financial pressure due to a sinking economy – would withdraw its latest offer in the case of a walk-out .
economists , meanwhile , noted that a strike could send germany 's weak economy back into a recession .
" pessimism could grow " " i could imagine the strikes to be the last straw , " rainer schmidt , labor market expert at the ifw economic institute told reuters .
" expectations are already pessimistic .
this pessimism could grow with strikes . "
indeed , union mediator hans koschnick urged the government to consider the price of a strike .
" if it comes to a strike , that will be much more expensive than what we have proposed , " he told german radio .
verdi has asked for a pay raise of 3 percent to be implemented in two phases over 18 months and for wages in the former east germany to equal those in the west by 2007 .
the last national public sector strike in germany was in 1992 .

growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .

in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .

however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .

representatives of public-sector workers said they were prepared for a long walk-out . germany faced the possibility of the first national public-sector strike in more than a decade as four days of talks between the government and union negotiators ground to a halt on monday .
leaders of the verdi trade union , which represents some 2.8 million public transit workers , nurses , fire fighters and other public employees , said they were prepared for a long strike beginning later in january if no deal is reached at a new round of talks on wednesday .
the government-appointed mediator , hinrich lehmann-grube , said employers could not accept a proposed compromise that called for wages to increase by 3 percent over the next year and a half .
employers countered with an offer of a 2.8 percent increase .
schily " moderately optimistic " " we are still willing to negotiate and i am moderately optimistic that we will come to an agreement on wednesday , " interior minister otto schily said in bremen , where the negotiations took place .
schily warned union members against a strike , saying that the government – already under severe financial pressure due to a sinking economy – would withdraw its latest offer in the case of a walk-out .
economists , meanwhile , noted that a strike could send germany 's weak economy back into a recession .
" pessimism could grow " " i could imagine the strikes to be the last straw , " rainer schmidt , labor market expert at the ifw economic institute told reuters .
" expectations are already pessimistic .
this pessimism could grow with strikes . "
indeed , union mediator hans koschnick urged the government to consider the price of a strike .
" if it comes to a strike , that will be much more expensive than what we have proposed , " he told german radio .
verdi has asked for a pay raise of 3 percent to be implemented in two phases over 18 months and for wages in the former east germany to equal those in the west by 2007 .

growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deadly future ?

representatives of public-sector workers said they were prepared for a long walk-out . germany faced the possibility of the first national public-sector strike in more than a decade as four days of talks between the government and union negotiators ground to a halt on monday .
leaders of the verdi trade union , which represents some 2.8 million public transit workers , nurses , fire fighters and other public employees , said they were prepared for a long strike beginning later in january if no deal is reached at a new round of talks on wednesday .

employers countered with an offer of a 2.8 percent increase .

economists , meanwhile , noted that a strike could send germany 's weak economy back into a recession .
" pessimism could grow " " i could imagine the strikes to be the last straw , " rainer schmidt , labor market expert at the ifw economic institute told reuters .

a guilty verdict on the charge of complicity , especially coming to close to duisenberg ’ s departure , could threaten trichet ’ s credibility .
the succession could also be thrown into question if the trial , which is expected to last six weeks , runs into delays . brilliant banker by most accounts , jean-claude trichet is well suited for the top job at the ecb .
he is considered one of the world ’ s brightest central bankers and enjoys a level respect among the financial community than wim duisenberg can only envy . many believe trichet should be the one in frankfurt anyway .
he was a hair ’ s breadth away from clinching the ecb job in 1998 when the german government expressed reservations about having a frenchman at the european economic helm .
a controversial compromise put the more neutral duisenberg in the top spot and stipulated that trichet would take over in 2003 . but in 2000 , a formal investigation began regarding in trichet ’ s role in the scandal at crédit lyonnais , the one-time state-owned bank whose troubles in the early 1990 ’ s .
a series of government bailouts in the years following cost french taxpayers more than 100 billion francs .
the bank was privatised in 1999 . in 1992 , the bank reported losses of 1.8 billion francs -lrb- euro -rrb- .
but prosecutors say the banks accounts , which were approved at the time by trichet , failed to reflect the billion of provisions against bad investments , hiding a loss in reality of nearly 7 billion francs . misleading accounting investigating magistrate phillip courroye argues that the accounts were deliberately understated so that crédit lyonnais would not break european rules on minimum solvency requirements for financial institutions . trichet ’ s lawyers counter that the charges of complicity against him are groundless .
they say he had no precise information over the actual state of the bank ’ s financial affairs nor the power to dictate what the bank reported in its statements . still , magistrates have unearthed a noted trichet wrote to the then finance minister in 1993 stating that “ publication of a bigger loss would have meant not respecting eu solvency laws and prompted questions about the solidity of europe ’ s leading financial institution . ” trichet stands accused with eight other leading french financial figures , including former crédit lyonnais president jean-yves haberer , jacques de larosière , one-time government of the bank of france , and jean-pascal beaufret , a treasury officials who is now cfo at the alcatel technology group . a verdict on the case has been promised before july . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the money maker goes the president of the european central bank , wim duisenberg , says he will cut short his tenure and step down in july 2003 .

growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .

representatives of public-sector workers said they were prepared for a long walk-out . germany faced the possibility of the first national public-sector strike in more than a decade as four days of talks between the government and union negotiators ground to a halt on monday .
leaders of the verdi trade union , which represents some 2.8 million public transit workers , nurses , fire fighters and other public employees , said they were prepared for a long strike beginning later in january if no deal is reached at a new round of talks on wednesday .
the government-appointed mediator , hinrich lehmann-grube , said employers could not accept a proposed compromise that called for wages to increase by 3 percent over the next year and a half .
employers countered with an offer of a 2.8 percent increase .
schily " moderately optimistic " " we are still willing to negotiate and i am moderately optimistic that we will come to an agreement on wednesday , " interior minister otto schily said in bremen , where the negotiations took place .
schily warned union members against a strike , saying that the government – already under severe financial pressure due to a sinking economy – would withdraw its latest offer in the case of a walk-out .
economists , meanwhile , noted that a strike could send germany 's weak economy back into a recession .
" pessimism could grow " " i could imagine the strikes to be the last straw , " rainer schmidt , labor market expert at the ifw economic institute told reuters .
" expectations are already pessimistic .
this pessimism could grow with strikes . "
indeed , union mediator hans koschnick urged the government to consider the price of a strike .
" if it comes to a strike , that will be much more expensive than what we have proposed , " he told german radio .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.01.2003 european forests thriving in high ozone areas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are european trees protecting themselves from pollution ?
growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deadly future ?
if it is proved that rising co2 levels are in some way protecting the trees , experts can only wonder at the widespread damage that will occur if this changes and the forests begin to show the catastrophic effects that have been predicted for the past 20 years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de i spy a lot of carbon dioxide with the launch of the carbon dioxide-measuring satellite envisat , europe makes its pitch as world leader in all things environmental .

growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .

representatives of public-sector workers said they were prepared for a long walk-out . germany faced the possibility of the first national public-sector strike in more than a decade as four days of talks between the government and union negotiators ground to a halt on monday .
leaders of the verdi trade union , which represents some 2.8 million public transit workers , nurses , fire fighters and other public employees , said they were prepared for a long strike beginning later in january if no deal is reached at a new round of talks on wednesday .
the government-appointed mediator , hinrich lehmann-grube , said employers could not accept a proposed compromise that called for wages to increase by 3 percent over the next year and a half .
employers countered with an offer of a 2.8 percent increase .
schily " moderately optimistic " " we are still willing to negotiate and i am moderately optimistic that we will come to an agreement on wednesday , " interior minister otto schily said in bremen , where the negotiations took place .
schily warned union members against a strike , saying that the government – already under severe financial pressure due to a sinking economy – would withdraw its latest offer in the case of a walk-out .
economists , meanwhile , noted that a strike could send germany 's weak economy back into a recession .
" pessimism could grow " " i could imagine the strikes to be the last straw , " rainer schmidt , labor market expert at the ifw economic institute told reuters .
" expectations are already pessimistic .
this pessimism could grow with strikes . "
indeed , union mediator hans koschnick urged the government to consider the price of a strike .
" if it comes to a strike , that will be much more expensive than what we have proposed , " he told german radio .
verdi has asked for a pay raise of 3 percent to be implemented in two phases over 18 months and for wages in the former east germany to equal those in the west by 2007 .
the last national public sector strike in germany was in 1992 .

a guilty verdict on the charge of complicity , especially coming to close to duisenberg ’ s departure , could threaten trichet ’ s credibility .
the succession could also be thrown into question if the trial , which is expected to last six weeks , runs into delays . brilliant banker by most accounts , jean-claude trichet is well suited for the top job at the ecb .
he is considered one of the world ’ s brightest central bankers and enjoys a level respect among the financial community than wim duisenberg can only envy . many believe trichet should be the one in frankfurt anyway .
he was a hair ’ s breadth away from clinching the ecb job in 1998 when the german government expressed reservations about having a frenchman at the european economic helm .
a controversial compromise put the more neutral duisenberg in the top spot and stipulated that trichet would take over in 2003 . but in 2000 , a formal investigation began regarding in trichet ’ s role in the scandal at crédit lyonnais , the one-time state-owned bank whose troubles in the early 1990 ’ s .
a series of government bailouts in the years following cost french taxpayers more than 100 billion francs .

representatives of public-sector workers said they were prepared for a long walk-out . germany faced the possibility of the first national public-sector strike in more than a decade as four days of talks between the government and union negotiators ground to a halt on monday .
leaders of the verdi trade union , which represents some 2.8 million public transit workers , nurses , fire fighters and other public employees , said they were prepared for a long strike beginning later in january if no deal is reached at a new round of talks on wednesday .
the government-appointed mediator , hinrich lehmann-grube , said employers could not accept a proposed compromise that called for wages to increase by 3 percent over the next year and a half .
employers countered with an offer of a 2.8 percent increase .
schily " moderately optimistic " " we are still willing to negotiate and i am moderately optimistic that we will come to an agreement on wednesday , " interior minister otto schily said in bremen , where the negotiations took place .
schily warned union members against a strike , saying that the government – already under severe financial pressure due to a sinking economy – would withdraw its latest offer in the case of a walk-out .
economists , meanwhile , noted that a strike could send germany 's weak economy back into a recession .
" pessimism could grow " " i could imagine the strikes to be the last straw , " rainer schmidt , labor market expert at the ifw economic institute told reuters .
" expectations are already pessimistic .
this pessimism could grow with strikes . "
indeed , union mediator hans koschnick urged the government to consider the price of a strike .
" if it comes to a strike , that will be much more expensive than what we have proposed , " he told german radio .

growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deadly future ?

growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .

representatives of public-sector workers said they were prepared for a long walk-out . germany faced the possibility of the first national public-sector strike in more than a decade as four days of talks between the government and union negotiators ground to a halt on monday .
leaders of the verdi trade union , which represents some 2.8 million public transit workers , nurses , fire fighters and other public employees , said they were prepared for a long strike beginning later in january if no deal is reached at a new round of talks on wednesday .
the government-appointed mediator , hinrich lehmann-grube , said employers could not accept a proposed compromise that called for wages to increase by 3 percent over the next year and a half .
employers countered with an offer of a 2.8 percent increase .
schily " moderately optimistic " " we are still willing to negotiate and i am moderately optimistic that we will come to an agreement on wednesday , " interior minister otto schily said in bremen , where the negotiations took place .
schily warned union members against a strike , saying that the government – already under severe financial pressure due to a sinking economy – would withdraw its latest offer in the case of a walk-out .
economists , meanwhile , noted that a strike could send germany 's weak economy back into a recession .
" pessimism could grow " " i could imagine the strikes to be the last straw , " rainer schmidt , labor market expert at the ifw economic institute told reuters .
" expectations are already pessimistic .
this pessimism could grow with strikes . "
indeed , union mediator hans koschnick urged the government to consider the price of a strike .
" if it comes to a strike , that will be much more expensive than what we have proposed , " he told german radio .

a guilty verdict on the charge of complicity , especially coming to close to duisenberg ’ s departure , could threaten trichet ’ s credibility .
the succession could also be thrown into question if the trial , which is expected to last six weeks , runs into delays . brilliant banker by most accounts , jean-claude trichet is well suited for the top job at the ecb .
he is considered one of the world ’ s brightest central bankers and enjoys a level respect among the financial community than wim duisenberg can only envy . many believe trichet should be the one in frankfurt anyway .
he was a hair ’ s breadth away from clinching the ecb job in 1998 when the german government expressed reservations about having a frenchman at the european economic helm .
a controversial compromise put the more neutral duisenberg in the top spot and stipulated that trichet would take over in 2003 . but in 2000 , a formal investigation began regarding in trichet ’ s role in the scandal at crédit lyonnais , the one-time state-owned bank whose troubles in the early 1990 ’ s .
a series of government bailouts in the years following cost french taxpayers more than 100 billion francs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 06.01.2003 european forests thriving in high ozone areas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are european trees protecting themselves from pollution ?
growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving . a european forests institute study of 39 countries suggests that forests across the continent may actually be helped by continued carbon dioxide emissions and the new evidence suggests they may have already greatly benefited from the phenomenon of human-created or anthropogenic co2 .
air pollution by other damaging gases has been significantly reduced in central europe over the past two decades while ozone levels have been on the rise , according to research collected from european databases that include ozone measurements from about 100 stations in austria and germany .
the study , covering forests from portugal to the urals in russia , shows what german ecologists had been fearing for two decades - that their woodlands are in danger .
however , even though the amounts of ozone reported across germany and austria have exceeded the united nations critical level , known as aot40 , by approximately seven times and have been shown to reduce tree growth by 10 percent in controlled experiments , the expected ecological disaster has not materialized .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happy and healthy : a euro tree .
in these areas of germany and austria where a seven-fold level has been reported , the forests are far from devastated .
experts studying the phenomena have reported that not only is there no sign of damage , but in fact there have been marked improvements in the health of trees and growth in the crown areas at the top of the trees has increased .
instead of dying , trees are thriving on co2 the research report shows that under present ozone levels , the trees in the target grid section in germany and austria do show some reduction of photosynthetic co2 absorption .
this is particularly evident in old trees at high altitudes where the levels of ozone are much more extreme , and in trees that are experiencing " additional climatic stress . "
however , the researchers are quick to point out that the reductions in carbon dioxide being absorbed by the trees " are in no proportion to the massive excess of the aot40 . "
so what does this all mean and how is it possible ?
with levels so high and evidence showing reduction in tree growth at a fraction of these current levels , trees across europe should be suffering a 70 percent reduction in growth , according to research .
instead , growth conditions seem to have improved almost everywhere , except at high altitudes and under conditions of more-than-usual climatic stress .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : leaves may hold the answer to the forests ' recovery .
one possible suggestion is that the once-adequate critical level of ozone exposure is no longer suitable for research purposes .
but why ?
researchers suggest that the answer comes not from using the level of atmospheric ozone as the critical level but the ozone dose absorbed by the trees .
this would mean a new level based on the ability of certain leaves to absorb carbon dioxide .
increasing levels of climactic change may be protection according to researchers , these findings suggest that the continuous changing of the earth 's atmospheric conditions must be taken into consideration when monitoring the effects of pollution on european forests .
predicted damage by ozone poisoning may have been offset by the increasing amounts of other gases and climactic factors arriving in the air surrounding the planet .
the center for the study of carbon dioxide and global change in the united states supports the theory that the trees have adapted in a way to reduce ozone damage .
the arizona-based research body believes that the lack of ozone damage in the forests of central europe may well be the result of benefits arising from rising levels of co2 content in the air .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a deadly future ?
if it is proved that rising co2 levels are in some way protecting the trees , experts can only wonder at the widespread damage that will occur if this changes and the forests begin to show the catastrophic effects that have been predicted for the past 20 years . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de i spy a lot of carbon dioxide with the launch of the carbon dioxide-measuring satellite envisat , europe makes its pitch as world leader in all things environmental .

the conference will be attended by both domestic and international experts , and takes place amid increasing concern throughout the country over the welfare of children .
human rights activists and aid agencies say thousands of children in bangladesh suffer on a daily basis .
the united nations says an estimated 300,000 live on the streets , while hundreds more are trafficked , sometimes unaccompanied , to the rest of south asia or the middle east .
camel jockeys the focus of the conference , staged by action against trafficking and sexual exploitation of children , is to explore ways of stopping children from being sent abroad against their will .
organisers say they are keen to prevent children from living and working in brothels across south asia .
in bangladesh alone , it is estimated that around 20,000 children live in the country 's 18 registered brothels .
atsec officials say they also want to stop the much-discussed problem of children being used as camel jockeys in the gulf countries .
jailed children a report published over the last week says more than 1,000 children are being held in adult jails across the country .
recent figures suggest that the number of juveniles being held in prison is unlikely to diminish in the foreseeable future , as there has been an increase in crime committed by children .
these range from carrying arms and explosives on behalf of political parties , to various drugs offences .
children are becoming more involved in violent crime and theft .
recently , three teenage boys were arrested in dhaka for killing a teacher , after one of them was demoted for poor exam results .

" this campaign is asking men whether or not they think their family can afford to have one of its incomes cut by up to 29 % when the christmas credit card bills start landing on the doormat , " she said .
the union would like to see the government legislate to make firms carry out regular equal pay audits to discover if female staff are lagging behind in the wages stakes .

typically in the two or three months leading up to one of these initiatives , prices are increased kevin hawkins , safeway director tesco said it was cutting £ 80m -lrb- $ 129m -rrb- from the price of more than 1,000 products with some prices falling by nearly a third .
and rival asda said it would be cutting some prices in its george clothing range .
but kevin hawkins , a director of the country 's fourth biggest supermarket , safeway , said he viewed the reductions with a big touch of scepticism .
he told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " we have these so-called price wars about three times a year .
" typically in the two or three months leading up to one of these initiatives , prices are increased . "
and he warned that while the price reductions were being highlighted , the cost of other goods would go up .
losing customers at tesco , director john gildersleeve said : " lots of customers are telling us they need to tighten their belts this year .
" we 've listened and taken pounds off their shopping in a bid to help . "
an asda spokeswoman said of her company 's clothing price cuts : " they are permanent price cuts .
" it is part of an ongoing commitment to pass any savings we can make back to customers .
" the reason we can do this is because we were bought by wal-mart in 1999 so we have much more buying power . "
if tesco and asda really are engaging in a tough price war then their rivals , sainsbury and safeway could lose some of their customers .
smaller chains such as somerfield might also be hit .

senior managers from the plant have visited the family of father-of-three mr coles in five roads , near llanelli , to pay their respects .
a corus spokesman said : " they spoke with the family , offered their sympathy and gave any practical help they could .
" the most important thing that the family did ask was to ensure that we got to the bottom of what exactly happened at the plant .
' shock ' " we assured them that we would do that , because it is important to ensure something like this never happens anywhere else .

as part of its reprisals for sunday 's attack , the israeli cabinet also decided to prevent senior palestinian officials from attending talks in london on reforming the palestinian authority , a close aide to prime minister ariel sharon said .
half the wall fell on me and i was covered in broken glass yitzhak teva , tel aviv barber soon after the tel aviv bombings , israeli helicopters fired rockets at a large metalworking factory in gaza city , which israel said was being used to make weapons .
eight people were reportedly lightly injured .
the tel aviv explosions - about two minutes apart - devastated the old bus station area and a busy shopping mall , injuring dozens of people , many of them foreign workers .
it was the deadliest attack inside israel since last march .
click here for eyewitness account police said 68 injured people were still in hospital on monday , two in critical condition and five serious .
israeli police said the two suicide bombers were carrying as much as 10 kilograms of explosives each , packed with bits of metal .
bystanders tore off doors to use as makeshift stretchers as the area 's narrow streets made it difficult for emergency services to evacuate casualties .
the attack - the first suicide bombing in israel since november - was claimed by the al aqsa martyrs brigades , an offshoot of palestinian leader yasser arafat 's fatah movement .
it named the two bombers as buraq khalifa and tamir al-nuri from the northern west bank city of nablus - a stronghold of the hardline group .
there were also less specific claims of responsibility from the militant groups islamic jihad and hamas .
prime minister sharon blamed yasser arafat for the bombings , saying he had failed to establish a ceasefire .
but he resisted a call from foreign minister binyamin netanyahu to expel mr arafat .
mr sharon said that only when the terror had stopped would israel be able to talk peace .
gaza raid the israeli army said the factory targeted in the gaza helicopter raid on sunday was used by several " terrorist " groups for making mortars and other weapons .
it is a despicable act of murder president bush on tel aviv attack palestinian officials denied that weapons were made there , saying it was a car parts factory .
witnesses said israeli tanks also moved into rafah , in the south of the gaza strip , and destroyed the house of a wanted member of islamic jihad .
several of his relatives were detained .

many victims are believed to be migrant workers poor foreign workers - mainly east european , african , thai and chinese - predominate in the area .
yitzhak teva , a local barber who was cutting hair at the time , said half of the wall fell on him and he was covered in broken glass .
" i shut the shop and then there was the next explosion , " he said .
the palestinians ' chief negotiator , saeb erekat , said the palestinian authority had nothing to do with the tel aviv attack and condemned the targeting of civilians .
president george bush said he condemned the attack " in the strongest possible terms " .
" it is a despicable act of murder , and i express my condolences to the government and people of israel and especially to the families of the victims , " he said .
" all who genuinely seek peace in the region must join in the effort to stop terror . "
army operations the israeli army has stepped up military operations in the west bank and gaza in the past six weeks , killing around 50 palestinians and carrying out a relentless wave of house demolitions , incursions and arrests .
palestinians say this hindered attempts by egypt and europe to broker an agreement among the factions to stop attacks in israel .
militants had vowed to take revenge for the army raids and said there would be no truce if incursions and assassinations continued . watch / listen on this story the bbc 's james rodgers reports from gaza city " no palestinian deaths were reported " ron prosor , spokesman for israel 's foreign ministry " we are for reforms and peace but we can not work this way " professor anoush ehteshami , durham university " foolish of israel to do this to the palestinian leadership " key stories israel 's early elections bombs and labour israel seeks us cash hamas resurgent profiles ariel sharon binyamin netanyahu amram mitzna yasser arafat factfile voices from the conflict talking point what will stop the suicide bombings ?

enthusiasts are continuing to use the dorothea quarry , in the nantlle valley , near caernarfon , even though sub-zero temperatures can make swimming more dangerous .
the pool is more than 300m deep in places has been the scene of many fatal accidents in recent years , but sub-aqua enthusiasts maintain that it is safe if treated with caution .
people travel from across britain to spend a few hours exploring the depths of the quarry , which has a network of flooded tunnels and sheer drops , making it a unique inland diving experience .
it is considered on of the best freshwater diving lakes .
but what makes it so appealing is also what makes it dangerous for the inexperienced .
the hidden dangers have led some sub aqua organisations to abandon training dives , but experienced divers say it is safe as as long as users do not take risks .
' beyond control ' " the type of people who are diving here and having accidents are diving to depths where there are not really a lot of chances , " said diving instructor simon gardner .
" if something goes wrong , there are not a lot of ways out of it , and a lot of experienced divers have had accidents here which were beyond their control . "
the quarry is privately-owned , which means those who use it are , technically , trespassing .
there are long-term plans to turn the quarry into a proper sub-aqua centre but , in the meantime , owner glyn small has warned divers to stay away .
after one of last year 's tragedies , mr small said he had made repeated efforts to prevent thrill-seekers using the area , but all his attempts to block access had been ignored .
he said roads into the quarry had been closed off with 30 tonne boulders and huge trenches , but groups had still managed to get into the site .
the last person to die after diving at the quarry was 57-year-old garage owner denis dransfield from oldham , greater manchester .
he failed to surface again during a diving expedition with a friend in november , and an inquest into his death has been opened and adjourned , pending a full hearing .
