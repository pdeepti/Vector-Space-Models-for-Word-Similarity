the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain . the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires important legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of schröder ’ s so-called “ agenda 2010 ” will be decided in a mediation committee representing germany ’ s two houses of parliament .
starting wednesday , the crucial talks will run through next monday . “ we still remain far apart on many important issues , ” volker kauder , the top negotiator for the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the afp news agency .
kauder said the chances of reaching a deal stood at “ fifty-fifty . ” schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the bundesrat – controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . schröder 's fate a package of sweeping reforms designed to kickstart growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state , schröder has tied his political future to the passage of agenda 2010 .
accordingly , members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have adopted an optimistic and conciliatory tone with the start of the talks . “ decisive will be whether we move towards each other .
and that we do , ” spd negotiator and bremen mayor henning scherf told journalists on wednesday . the opposition remains loath to give schröder a political victory he so desperately needs at the moment as the spd hovers at all-time lows in opinion polls .
but the conservatives are also aware that blocking the reforms could backfire at a time when germany ’ s is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . being negotiated are plans to bring forward tax cuts worth € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- by a year to 2004 and cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits .
the 32-member mediation committee will have to wade through nearly 3,000 pages of legislation broken up into 15 separate parts . although there has been no official confirmation , there is speculation that schröder will meet with top members of the opposition to thrash out an agreement .

the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain . the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires important legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of schröder ’ s so-called “ agenda 2010 ” will be decided in a mediation committee representing germany ’ s two houses of parliament .
starting wednesday , the crucial talks will run through next monday . “ we still remain far apart on many important issues , ” volker kauder , the top negotiator for the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the afp news agency .

that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . schröder 's fate a package of sweeping reforms designed to kickstart growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state , schröder has tied his political future to the passage of agenda 2010 .

and that we do , ” spd negotiator and bremen mayor henning scherf told journalists on wednesday . the opposition remains loath to give schröder a political victory he so desperately needs at the moment as the spd hovers at all-time lows in opinion polls .
but the conservatives are also aware that blocking the reforms could backfire at a time when germany ’ s is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . being negotiated are plans to bring forward tax cuts worth € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- by a year to 2004 and cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits .
the 32-member mediation committee will have to wade through nearly 3,000 pages of legislation broken up into 15 separate parts . although there has been no official confirmation , there is speculation that schröder will meet with top members of the opposition to thrash out an agreement .

as representatives from 125 nations prepare to sign a u.n. convention against corruption on tuesday , german parliamentarians find themselves split on whether stricter laws would help prevent corruption among their ranks . most countries have already banned their parliamentarians from accepting kickbacks in exchange for votes .
members of germany ’ s bundestag , however , only get in trouble if they receive so-called “ thank you gifts ” before casting their vote .
remuneration after the fact , known as a “ you ’ re welcome gift , ” is not considered a crime . the signing of the united nations document , which also aims to improve the prevention of cross-border corruption such as the elf aquitaine scandal , puts pressure on germany to fix this loophole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , supports stricter anti-corruption laws for parliamentarians .
germany ’ s justice ministry , headed by brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- , agrees that this needs to happen .

beck ’ s statement on wednesday was echoed by social democrats energy expert hermann scheer .
“ peking will never accept the conditions , ” scheer said .
“ the business is dead de facto . ”
on tuesday , the spd and greens decided only to permit the deal if the nuclear factory is put under the permanent control of the international atomic energy agency iaea .
china would have to guarantee that the plant is used for peaceful purposes only .
critics see the chinese opposition to iaea supervision as the effective death knell for the deal . more briefs 10.12.2003 -pipe- struck defends plans for eu military 09.12.2003 -pipe- defense minister calls for stronger european defense policy 09.12.2003 -pipe- petersberg may host third afghanistan conference 09.12.2003 -pipe- german tv viewers mourn era 's end 09.12.2003 -pipe- frankfurt ballet director scoops german culture council award 08.12.2003 -pipe- klitschko lays down challenge to champion lewis 08.12.2003 -pipe- life sentences for tom and sonja ’ s killers 08.12.2003 -pipe- germans among foreigners kidnapped in iran radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .

by comparing the effectiveness of the pills to the genetic material of the donors , the company hopes to find out why the medication works for one person but not the other .
' ' we 're basically predicting a person 's response to the drug , " diamond said . if estonia 's project is to survive , it needs many more diamonds , estonian genome project officials acknowledged .
the company charged with finding them is egeen , an estonian-led start-up in the san francisco bay area that holds the commercial rights to the database .
kalev kask , egeen 's ceo and a native estonian , cut his teeth in the turbulent silicon valley biotech industry .
he acknowledged the less-than-ideal investment climate currently for biotech ventures , but said the clinical drug trials underway in estonia are exactly the type of thing that will attract pharmaceutial companies .
' ' the climate is such that you better come up with something that has short-term economic return , " he said .
in addition to money concerns , the project has yielded its fair share of ethical questions as well .
after decades under what they call the ' ' soviet occupation , " some estonians are wary of the orwellian request to put their most personal information in the hands of a few people .
privacy and ethical concerns remain ' ' the project goes to your very basic being , an area that is very private , " said tiit veeber , 54 , a tartu businessman .
' ' these couple of people control the data . . . .
what will they do with that data ?
and do they have a right to sell it ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab worker separating dna to stem these concerns , the estonian government passed a law in 2000 that requires gene donors to sign a contract giving their consent .
anyone caught misusing gene donor information faces criminal prosecution .
the law also ensures gene donor information and their blood samples are separated and forbids companies or researchers from taking the information out of the country , ensuring that the data does n't fall into the wrong hands .
as to whether egeen has a right to make money off of someone 's genetic material , metspalu said the project 's altruistic motives far outweigh any financial ones .
' ' it 's our turn to put something into this collective pool of knowledge , " he said .
if people make money off of it , ' ' then so be it : this is putting estonia on the map .

daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen e. schrempp testified before a u.s. federal court that there were never any secret plans for a take over of chrysler .
what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s. 's third-largest car manufacturer , chrysler , with germany 's daimler-benz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- photo -rrb- claims that daimler-benz presented the $ 36 billion deal as a merger of equals , when really it was a secret take over bid .
he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .
he said it was only in the second half of 2000 that problems with chrysler 's management began to emerge - problems that had nothing to do with the merger . another top daimlerchrysler official , hilmar kopper , said in a taped deposition that it only then became clear that chrysler lacked competent management , meaning that the company had no choice but to fill executive positions with german executives instead of americans . " we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons . " when asked about the interview in court , schrempp said : " we were in an extremely difficult situation , we were hammered by the media for the performance of the company , particularly chrysler , and there was talk all around that the merger had n't worked .

he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .
he said it was only in the second half of 2000 that problems with chrysler 's management began to emerge - problems that had nothing to do with the merger . another top daimlerchrysler official , hilmar kopper , said in a taped deposition that it only then became clear that chrysler lacked competent management , meaning that the company had no choice but to fill executive positions with german executives instead of americans . " we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons . " when asked about the interview in court , schrempp said : " we were in an extremely difficult situation , we were hammered by the media for the performance of the company , particularly chrysler , and there was talk all around that the merger had n't worked . " schrempp will be cross-examined on wednesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report clears daimlerchrysler of human rights violations a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .

germany 's chancellor and france 's president said they will not budge on majority voting rights in a new eu constitution as national leaders hasten to find a compromise before a decisive meeting on friday . after tueday ’ s summit in paris , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder made it clear that they will not go along with a watered-down version of the draft of europe 's first ever constitution .
" the chancellor and i will not accept an accord at any price , " chirac said .
" i hope that we can reach an agreement with spain and poland , but i ’ m not certain of it . "
spain and portugal have been resisting plans to change eu voting rights to reflect population sizes rather than give each country an equal say .
under the 2002 nice treaty , which would be replaced by the constitution , poland and spain would have voting rights disproportionate to their size .
the two countries are demanding that the nice provisions remain intact .
schröder said he was going into friday ’ s meeting in brussels as a " skeptical optimist , " adding that both he and chirac still hoped to " get a deal . "
but " voting structures must be designed so that no one country along can hold up the -lrb- decision-making -rrb- process on key issues , " schröder said .
" that means majority voting as far as is possible . "
" francallmagne " if eu constitution fails ?
the two leaders also made it clear that they would not let other countries stop their desire to grow closer .
" we do a lot with each other and for each other , " schröder said .
" you can rely on that , whatever the situation . "
german and french officials have suggested a closer cooperation between their two countries , some even going as far as suggesting dual citizenship .
others , including former german chancellor helmut schmidt , reject such ideas of a " francallmagne . "
" we need a new treaty for a larger europe , not a new one for france and germany " , newsmagazine der spiegel quoted him as saying .
spain and poland lobby london , criticize rome meanwhile , the leaders of spain and poland lobbied britain to support them in preventing a majority voting system and accused the italian eu presidency of failing to come up with a working compromise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's jose maria aznar has criticized his italian colleague silvio berlusconi for failing to present a working compromise .
" it ’ s impossible to reach a compromise under the current circumstances , " spanish premier jose maria aznar said .
he agreed with his polish colleague , leszek miller , that italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , had a " moral duty " to serve as chief mediator in the conflict .
italian premier silvio berlusconi has said he supports france and germany on the voting issue .
miller also planned to talk with british prime minister tony blair to get his support in the matter .
blair himself still resists the draft constitution for other reasons : he insists on assurances that each country will continue to keep veto power on foreign and security policy issues .
italy attempts to mediate trying to deal with blair ’ s concerns , berlusconi on tuesday presented a new draft of the constitution which would allow for national interest " emergency breaks " on any plans to do away with national vetoes in the areas of social security and judicial cooperation , the financial times newspaper reported .
british diplomats in brussels already rejected the idea as " not acceptable . "
with his proposal , berlusconi also attempts to accommodate the four eu countries that are not members of the nato alliance - austria , ireland , finland and sweden - by guaranteeing them recognition of their special defense status as far as a new " mutual defense clause " in the draft document is concerned .

germany 's chancellor and france 's president said they will not budge on majority voting rights in a new eu constitution as national leaders hasten to find a compromise before a decisive meeting on friday . after tueday ’ s summit in paris , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder made it clear that they will not go along with a watered-down version of the draft of europe 's first ever constitution .
" the chancellor and i will not accept an accord at any price , " chirac said .
" i hope that we can reach an agreement with spain and poland , but i ’ m not certain of it . "
spain and portugal have been resisting plans to change eu voting rights to reflect population sizes rather than give each country an equal say .
under the 2002 nice treaty , which would be replaced by the constitution , poland and spain would have voting rights disproportionate to their size .
the two countries are demanding that the nice provisions remain intact .
schröder said he was going into friday ’ s meeting in brussels as a " skeptical optimist , " adding that both he and chirac still hoped to " get a deal . "
but " voting structures must be designed so that no one country along can hold up the -lrb- decision-making -rrb- process on key issues , " schröder said .
" that means majority voting as far as is possible . "
" francallmagne " if eu constitution fails ?
the two leaders also made it clear that they would not let other countries stop their desire to grow closer .
" we do a lot with each other and for each other , " schröder said .
" you can rely on that , whatever the situation . "
german and french officials have suggested a closer cooperation between their two countries , some even going as far as suggesting dual citizenship .
others , including former german chancellor helmut schmidt , reject such ideas of a " francallmagne . "
" we need a new treaty for a larger europe , not a new one for france and germany " , newsmagazine der spiegel quoted him as saying .
spain and poland lobby london , criticize rome meanwhile , the leaders of spain and poland lobbied britain to support them in preventing a majority voting system and accused the italian eu presidency of failing to come up with a working compromise .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's jose maria aznar has criticized his italian colleague silvio berlusconi for failing to present a working compromise .
" it ’ s impossible to reach a compromise under the current circumstances , " spanish premier jose maria aznar said .
he agreed with his polish colleague , leszek miller , that italy , which currently holds the rotating eu presidency , had a " moral duty " to serve as chief mediator in the conflict .
italian premier silvio berlusconi has said he supports france and germany on the voting issue .
miller also planned to talk with british prime minister tony blair to get his support in the matter .
blair himself still resists the draft constitution for other reasons : he insists on assurances that each country will continue to keep veto power on foreign and security policy issues .
italy attempts to mediate trying to deal with blair ’ s concerns , berlusconi on tuesday presented a new draft of the constitution which would allow for national interest " emergency breaks " on any plans to do away with national vetoes in the areas of social security and judicial cooperation , the financial times newspaper reported .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
along with several relatives , principe attended wednesday ’ s opening ceremony at thierse ’ s invitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , right , talks to her lawyer as bundestag president wolfgang thierse , left , speaks with reporters during wednesday 's opening ceremony . the president of the bundestag assured them of his support in finding a solution to the dispute .
“ if compensation claims are justified , they will have to be recognized and enforced appropriately , ” thierse said . compensating wertheim ’ s descendants or legal successors ? even if germany ends up offering more money for the land , it ’ s still unclear whether wertheim ’ s heirs will receive it .
that 's because the family is embroiled in a seperate legal battle with german retailing giant karstadtquelle . karstadt-quelle also claims ownership of the land on which the new library stands : in 1994 , the company took over competitor hertie , which in turn had bought the remaining wertheim assets in 1952 .
the descendants received about € 20,000 . “ karstadt still profits from our family ’ s name and heritage , ” principe said during a news conference on wednesday , adding that karstadt was trying to keep the wertheim descendants from receiving adequate compensation for the property in eastern germany . a karstadt spokesman told dw-world that the company will continue to pursue its claims to the wertheim property . in a separate matter , principe and her relatives have filed a civil law suit against karstadtquelle in the u.s. and are seeking several hundred million dollars in compensation for another property on berlin ’ s swanky potsdamer platz .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .

the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .

george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .

george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .

far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .

george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .

george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .

far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .

as representatives from 125 nations prepare to sign a u.n. convention against corruption on tuesday , german parliamentarians find themselves split on whether stricter laws would help prevent corruption among their ranks . most countries have already banned their parliamentarians from accepting kickbacks in exchange for votes .
members of germany ’ s bundestag , however , only get in trouble if they receive so-called “ thank you gifts ” before casting their vote .
remuneration after the fact , known as a “ you ’ re welcome gift , ” is not considered a crime . the signing of the united nations document , which also aims to improve the prevention of cross-border corruption such as the elf aquitaine scandal , puts pressure on germany to fix this loophole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , supports stricter anti-corruption laws for parliamentarians .
germany ’ s justice ministry , headed by brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- , agrees that this needs to happen .
the u.n. convention , which took three years to hammer out , will have to be ratified by at least 30 countries before entering into force .
it has been described as a milestone for global efforts to combat graft and will be signed by government representatives during a three-day u.n. conference that starts on tuesday in merida , mexico . but german parliamentarians , who will ultimately have to vote on changing the law , disagree on whether such a step will help to clamp down on corruption . too difficult to prosecute corruption ? “ we need a clearer separation between corruption among parliamentarians and their legal representation of interests , ” klaus uwe benneter , a social democratic member of parliament who sits on the legal affairs committee , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . norbert geis , the opposition christian social union ’ s spokesman on legal affairs , countered that it would be hard to prosecute corruption in parliament .
some of his conservative colleagues agreed . a stricter law on combating corruption would lead to more investigations but not more convictions , eckart von klaeden of the christian democratic union ’ s parliamentary leadership told the berliner zeitung . even under current law , no german parliamentarian has been prosecuted for corruption .
in its 2003 corruption perception index , transparency international , a non-governmental organization that monitors worldwide corruption , ranked germany in 16th place , behind singapore and hong kong . parliamentarians ’ side jobs criticized while calling upon german parliamentarians to get tougher on themselves , transparency international also criticized the number of side jobs many lawmakers have here .
moonlighting “ could lead to political dependencies which eventually affect the parliamentarian ’ s decision-making process , ” dagmar schröder , executive director of the organization 's german chapter , told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the u.s. house of representatives are banned from any side jobs during their term in office .
in the u.s. , members of the house of representatives are banned from any side jobs , including such things as serving on company advisory boards .
germany ’ s members of parliament on the other hand are only required to make public such sources of extra income . moonlighting parliamentarians more independent ? some of the bundestag ’ s biggest moonlighters disagreed with schröder ’ s assessment .
günter rexrodt , a former minister of economics and member of the opposition free liberal democrats , said he saw nothing wrong with lawmakers earning some extra money on the side .
“ it ’ s a good thing if parliamentarians are in touch with life , ” rexrodt told the berliner zeitung .
he added that parliamentarians with side jobs were much more relaxed and more independent . just last week , a green party member of parliament resigned from her positions as advisory board member with several insurance companies after her own party colleagues criticized her for it .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .
' ' you want your results to have wide applicability , " said cornelius diamond , the chief executive officer of a san diego-based biotech company , prediction sciences . just who will access the data , and how well will the database be protected ?

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .
' ' you want your results to have wide applicability , " said cornelius diamond , the chief executive officer of a san diego-based biotech company , prediction sciences . just who will access the data , and how well will the database be protected ?

by comparing the effectiveness of the pills to the genetic material of the donors , the company hopes to find out why the medication works for one person but not the other .
' ' we 're basically predicting a person 's response to the drug , " diamond said . if estonia 's project is to survive , it needs many more diamonds , estonian genome project officials acknowledged .
the company charged with finding them is egeen , an estonian-led start-up in the san francisco bay area that holds the commercial rights to the database .
kalev kask , egeen 's ceo and a native estonian , cut his teeth in the turbulent silicon valley biotech industry .
he acknowledged the less-than-ideal investment climate currently for biotech ventures , but said the clinical drug trials underway in estonia are exactly the type of thing that will attract pharmaceutial companies .
' ' the climate is such that you better come up with something that has short-term economic return , " he said .
in addition to money concerns , the project has yielded its fair share of ethical questions as well .
after decades under what they call the ' ' soviet occupation , " some estonians are wary of the orwellian request to put their most personal information in the hands of a few people .
privacy and ethical concerns remain ' ' the project goes to your very basic being , an area that is very private , " said tiit veeber , 54 , a tartu businessman .
' ' these couple of people control the data . . . .
what will they do with that data ?
and do they have a right to sell it ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab worker separating dna to stem these concerns , the estonian government passed a law in 2000 that requires gene donors to sign a contract giving their consent .
anyone caught misusing gene donor information faces criminal prosecution .
the law also ensures gene donor information and their blood samples are separated and forbids companies or researchers from taking the information out of the country , ensuring that the data does n't fall into the wrong hands .
as to whether egeen has a right to make money off of someone 's genetic material , metspalu said the project 's altruistic motives far outweigh any financial ones .
' ' it 's our turn to put something into this collective pool of knowledge , " he said .

daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen e. schrempp testified before a u.s. federal court that there were never any secret plans for a take over of chrysler .
what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s. 's third-largest car manufacturer , chrysler , with germany 's daimler-benz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- photo -rrb- claims that daimler-benz presented the $ 36 billion deal as a merger of equals , when really it was a secret take over bid .
he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .
he said it was only in the second half of 2000 that problems with chrysler 's management began to emerge - problems that had nothing to do with the merger . another top daimlerchrysler official , hilmar kopper , said in a taped deposition that it only then became clear that chrysler lacked competent management , meaning that the company had no choice but to fill executive positions with german executives instead of americans . " we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons . " when asked about the interview in court , schrempp said : " we were in an extremely difficult situation , we were hammered by the media for the performance of the company , particularly chrysler , and there was talk all around that the merger had n't worked .

what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s. 's third-largest car manufacturer , chrysler , with germany 's daimler-benz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- photo -rrb- claims that daimler-benz presented the $ 36 billion deal as a merger of equals , when really it was a secret take over bid .
he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .
he said it was only in the second half of 2000 that problems with chrysler 's management began to emerge - problems that had nothing to do with the merger . another top daimlerchrysler official , hilmar kopper , said in a taped deposition that it only then became clear that chrysler lacked competent management , meaning that the company had no choice but to fill executive positions with german executives instead of americans . " we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons . " when asked about the interview in court , schrempp said : " we were in an extremely difficult situation , we were hammered by the media for the performance of the company , particularly chrysler , and there was talk all around that the merger had n't worked .

the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france . calling the decision “ essential ” to washington ’ s security interests , deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said washington had drawn up a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . “ it is necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the united states to limit competition for the prime contracts for these procurements , ” wolfowitz said in a statement .

the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france . calling the decision “ essential ” to washington ’ s security interests , deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said washington had drawn up a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . “ it is necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the united states to limit competition for the prime contracts for these procurements , ” wolfowitz said in a statement .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
along with several relatives , principe attended wednesday ’ s opening ceremony at thierse ’ s invitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , right , talks to her lawyer as bundestag president wolfgang thierse , left , speaks with reporters during wednesday 's opening ceremony . the president of the bundestag assured them of his support in finding a solution to the dispute .
“ if compensation claims are justified , they will have to be recognized and enforced appropriately , ” thierse said . compensating wertheim ’ s descendants or legal successors ? even if germany ends up offering more money for the land , it ’ s still unclear whether wertheim ’ s heirs will receive it .
that 's because the family is embroiled in a seperate legal battle with german retailing giant karstadtquelle . karstadt-quelle also claims ownership of the land on which the new library stands : in 1994 , the company took over competitor hertie , which in turn had bought the remaining wertheim assets in 1952 .
the descendants received about € 20,000 . “ karstadt still profits from our family ’ s name and heritage , ” principe said during a news conference on wednesday , adding that karstadt was trying to keep the wertheim descendants from receiving adequate compensation for the property in eastern germany . a karstadt spokesman told dw-world that the company will continue to pursue its claims to the wertheim property . in a separate matter , principe and her relatives have filed a civil law suit against karstadtquelle in the u.s. and are seeking several hundred million dollars in compensation for another property on berlin ’ s swanky potsdamer platz .
a court decision in the case is expected next spring . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin - the resurrected capital dw-world 's series on berlin 's renaissance as a capital city after german reunification .

the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain . the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires important legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of schröder ’ s so-called “ agenda 2010 ” will be decided in a mediation committee representing germany ’ s two houses of parliament .
starting wednesday , the crucial talks will run through next monday . “ we still remain far apart on many important issues , ” volker kauder , the top negotiator for the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the afp news agency .
kauder said the chances of reaching a deal stood at “ fifty-fifty . ” schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the bundesrat – controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . schröder 's fate a package of sweeping reforms designed to kickstart growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state , schröder has tied his political future to the passage of agenda 2010 .
accordingly , members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have adopted an optimistic and conciliatory tone with the start of the talks . “ decisive will be whether we move towards each other .
and that we do , ” spd negotiator and bremen mayor henning scherf told journalists on wednesday . the opposition remains loath to give schröder a political victory he so desperately needs at the moment as the spd hovers at all-time lows in opinion polls .
but the conservatives are also aware that blocking the reforms could backfire at a time when germany ’ s is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . being negotiated are plans to bring forward tax cuts worth € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- by a year to 2004 and cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits .
the 32-member mediation committee will have to wade through nearly 3,000 pages of legislation broken up into 15 separate parts . although there has been no official confirmation , there is speculation that schröder will meet with top members of the opposition to thrash out an agreement .

the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain . the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires important legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of schröder ’ s so-called “ agenda 2010 ” will be decided in a mediation committee representing germany ’ s two houses of parliament .
starting wednesday , the crucial talks will run through next monday . “ we still remain far apart on many important issues , ” volker kauder , the top negotiator for the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the afp news agency .
kauder said the chances of reaching a deal stood at “ fifty-fifty . ” schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the bundesrat – controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . schröder 's fate a package of sweeping reforms designed to kickstart growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state , schröder has tied his political future to the passage of agenda 2010 .
accordingly , members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have adopted an optimistic and conciliatory tone with the start of the talks . “ decisive will be whether we move towards each other .
and that we do , ” spd negotiator and bremen mayor henning scherf told journalists on wednesday . the opposition remains loath to give schröder a political victory he so desperately needs at the moment as the spd hovers at all-time lows in opinion polls .
but the conservatives are also aware that blocking the reforms could backfire at a time when germany ’ s is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . being negotiated are plans to bring forward tax cuts worth € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- by a year to 2004 and cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits .
the 32-member mediation committee will have to wade through nearly 3,000 pages of legislation broken up into 15 separate parts . although there has been no official confirmation , there is speculation that schröder will meet with top members of the opposition to thrash out an agreement .
but cdu party leader angela merkel has warned against putting too much hope in high-level talks and has called on the government to negotiate in the mediation committee . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 100,000 protest german reforms in berlin tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market .

george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .

daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen e. schrempp testified before a u.s. federal court that there were never any secret plans for a take over of chrysler .
what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s. 's third-largest car manufacturer , chrysler , with germany 's daimler-benz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- photo -rrb- claims that daimler-benz presented the $ 36 billion deal as a merger of equals , when really it was a secret take over bid .
he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .
he said it was only in the second half of 2000 that problems with chrysler 's management began to emerge - problems that had nothing to do with the merger . another top daimlerchrysler official , hilmar kopper , said in a taped deposition that it only then became clear that chrysler lacked competent management , meaning that the company had no choice but to fill executive positions with german executives instead of americans . " we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons . " when asked about the interview in court , schrempp said : " we were in an extremely difficult situation , we were hammered by the media for the performance of the company , particularly chrysler , and there was talk all around that the merger had n't worked .

george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .

george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .

as representatives from 125 nations prepare to sign a u.n. convention against corruption on tuesday , german parliamentarians find themselves split on whether stricter laws would help prevent corruption among their ranks . most countries have already banned their parliamentarians from accepting kickbacks in exchange for votes .
members of germany ’ s bundestag , however , only get in trouble if they receive so-called “ thank you gifts ” before casting their vote .
remuneration after the fact , known as a “ you ’ re welcome gift , ” is not considered a crime . the signing of the united nations document , which also aims to improve the prevention of cross-border corruption such as the elf aquitaine scandal , puts pressure on germany to fix this loophole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , supports stricter anti-corruption laws for parliamentarians .
germany ’ s justice ministry , headed by brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- , agrees that this needs to happen .
the u.n. convention , which took three years to hammer out , will have to be ratified by at least 30 countries before entering into force .
it has been described as a milestone for global efforts to combat graft and will be signed by government representatives during a three-day u.n. conference that starts on tuesday in merida , mexico . but german parliamentarians , who will ultimately have to vote on changing the law , disagree on whether such a step will help to clamp down on corruption . too difficult to prosecute corruption ? “ we need a clearer separation between corruption among parliamentarians and their legal representation of interests , ” klaus uwe benneter , a social democratic member of parliament who sits on the legal affairs committee , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . norbert geis , the opposition christian social union ’ s spokesman on legal affairs , countered that it would be hard to prosecute corruption in parliament .
some of his conservative colleagues agreed . a stricter law on combating corruption would lead to more investigations but not more convictions , eckart von klaeden of the christian democratic union ’ s parliamentary leadership told the berliner zeitung . even under current law , no german parliamentarian has been prosecuted for corruption .
in its 2003 corruption perception index , transparency international , a non-governmental organization that monitors worldwide corruption , ranked germany in 16th place , behind singapore and hong kong . parliamentarians ’ side jobs criticized while calling upon german parliamentarians to get tougher on themselves , transparency international also criticized the number of side jobs many lawmakers have here .
moonlighting “ could lead to political dependencies which eventually affect the parliamentarian ’ s decision-making process , ” dagmar schröder , executive director of the organization 's german chapter , told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the u.s. house of representatives are banned from any side jobs during their term in office .
in the u.s. , members of the house of representatives are banned from any side jobs , including such things as serving on company advisory boards .
germany ’ s members of parliament on the other hand are only required to make public such sources of extra income . moonlighting parliamentarians more independent ? some of the bundestag ’ s biggest moonlighters disagreed with schröder ’ s assessment .
günter rexrodt , a former minister of economics and member of the opposition free liberal democrats , said he saw nothing wrong with lawmakers earning some extra money on the side .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .

the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain . the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires important legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of schröder ’ s so-called “ agenda 2010 ” will be decided in a mediation committee representing germany ’ s two houses of parliament .
starting wednesday , the crucial talks will run through next monday . “ we still remain far apart on many important issues , ” volker kauder , the top negotiator for the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the afp news agency .

but the conservatives are also aware that blocking the reforms could backfire at a time when germany ’ s is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . being negotiated are plans to bring forward tax cuts worth € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- by a year to 2004 and cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits .
the 32-member mediation committee will have to wade through nearly 3,000 pages of legislation broken up into 15 separate parts . although there has been no official confirmation , there is speculation that schröder will meet with top members of the opposition to thrash out an agreement .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
along with several relatives , principe attended wednesday ’ s opening ceremony at thierse ’ s invitation .

that 's because the family is embroiled in a seperate legal battle with german retailing giant karstadtquelle . karstadt-quelle also claims ownership of the land on which the new library stands : in 1994 , the company took over competitor hertie , which in turn had bought the remaining wertheim assets in 1952 .
the descendants received about € 20,000 . “ karstadt still profits from our family ’ s name and heritage , ” principe said during a news conference on wednesday , adding that karstadt was trying to keep the wertheim descendants from receiving adequate compensation for the property in eastern germany . a karstadt spokesman told dw-world that the company will continue to pursue its claims to the wertheim property . in a separate matter , principe and her relatives have filed a civil law suit against karstadtquelle in the u.s. and are seeking several hundred million dollars in compensation for another property on berlin ’ s swanky potsdamer platz .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
along with several relatives , principe attended wednesday ’ s opening ceremony at thierse ’ s invitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , right , talks to her lawyer as bundestag president wolfgang thierse , left , speaks with reporters during wednesday 's opening ceremony . the president of the bundestag assured them of his support in finding a solution to the dispute .
“ if compensation claims are justified , they will have to be recognized and enforced appropriately , ” thierse said . compensating wertheim ’ s descendants or legal successors ? even if germany ends up offering more money for the land , it ’ s still unclear whether wertheim ’ s heirs will receive it .
that 's because the family is embroiled in a seperate legal battle with german retailing giant karstadtquelle . karstadt-quelle also claims ownership of the land on which the new library stands : in 1994 , the company took over competitor hertie , which in turn had bought the remaining wertheim assets in 1952 .
the descendants received about € 20,000 . “ karstadt still profits from our family ’ s name and heritage , ” principe said during a news conference on wednesday , adding that karstadt was trying to keep the wertheim descendants from receiving adequate compensation for the property in eastern germany . a karstadt spokesman told dw-world that the company will continue to pursue its claims to the wertheim property . in a separate matter , principe and her relatives have filed a civil law suit against karstadtquelle in the u.s. and are seeking several hundred million dollars in compensation for another property on berlin ’ s swanky potsdamer platz .
a court decision in the case is expected next spring . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin - the resurrected capital dw-world 's series on berlin 's renaissance as a capital city after german reunification .

the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france . calling the decision “ essential ” to washington ’ s security interests , deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said washington had drawn up a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . “ it is necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the united states to limit competition for the prime contracts for these procurements , ” wolfowitz said in a statement .

the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france . calling the decision “ essential ” to washington ’ s security interests , deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said washington had drawn up a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . “ it is necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the united states to limit competition for the prime contracts for these procurements , ” wolfowitz said in a statement .

daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen e. schrempp testified before a u.s. federal court that there were never any secret plans for a take over of chrysler .
what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s. 's third-largest car manufacturer , chrysler , with germany 's daimler-benz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- photo -rrb- claims that daimler-benz presented the $ 36 billion deal as a merger of equals , when really it was a secret take over bid .
he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .
he said it was only in the second half of 2000 that problems with chrysler 's management began to emerge - problems that had nothing to do with the merger . another top daimlerchrysler official , hilmar kopper , said in a taped deposition that it only then became clear that chrysler lacked competent management , meaning that the company had no choice but to fill executive positions with german executives instead of americans . " we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons . " when asked about the interview in court , schrempp said : " we were in an extremely difficult situation , we were hammered by the media for the performance of the company , particularly chrysler , and there was talk all around that the merger had n't worked .

daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen e. schrempp testified before a u.s. federal court that there were never any secret plans for a take over of chrysler .
what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s. 's third-largest car manufacturer , chrysler , with germany 's daimler-benz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- photo -rrb- claims that daimler-benz presented the $ 36 billion deal as a merger of equals , when really it was a secret take over bid .
he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.12.2003 estonia sees its future in genes back to first page back 2/2 survival depends on quick results bildunterschrift : dns-labor in estland genpool labor diamond 's small firm already has signed on to the genome project and recently completed testing two antidepressants on a couple of hundred willing estonians .
by comparing the effectiveness of the pills to the genetic material of the donors , the company hopes to find out why the medication works for one person but not the other .
' ' we 're basically predicting a person 's response to the drug , " diamond said . if estonia 's project is to survive , it needs many more diamonds , estonian genome project officials acknowledged .
the company charged with finding them is egeen , an estonian-led start-up in the san francisco bay area that holds the commercial rights to the database .
kalev kask , egeen 's ceo and a native estonian , cut his teeth in the turbulent silicon valley biotech industry .
he acknowledged the less-than-ideal investment climate currently for biotech ventures , but said the clinical drug trials underway in estonia are exactly the type of thing that will attract pharmaceutial companies .
' ' the climate is such that you better come up with something that has short-term economic return , " he said .
in addition to money concerns , the project has yielded its fair share of ethical questions as well .
after decades under what they call the ' ' soviet occupation , " some estonians are wary of the orwellian request to put their most personal information in the hands of a few people .
privacy and ethical concerns remain ' ' the project goes to your very basic being , an area that is very private , " said tiit veeber , 54 , a tartu businessman .
' ' these couple of people control the data . . . .
what will they do with that data ?
and do they have a right to sell it ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab worker separating dna to stem these concerns , the estonian government passed a law in 2000 that requires gene donors to sign a contract giving their consent .
anyone caught misusing gene donor information faces criminal prosecution .
the law also ensures gene donor information and their blood samples are separated and forbids companies or researchers from taking the information out of the country , ensuring that the data does n't fall into the wrong hands .
as to whether egeen has a right to make money off of someone 's genetic material , metspalu said the project 's altruistic motives far outweigh any financial ones .
' ' it 's our turn to put something into this collective pool of knowledge , " he said .
if people make money off of it , ' ' then so be it : this is putting estonia on the map .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.12.2003 new german patriotism : the road to berlin goes via baghdad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin band mia dressed in the national colors of germany .
george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .

as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
along with several relatives , principe attended wednesday ’ s opening ceremony at thierse ’ s invitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , right , talks to her lawyer as bundestag president wolfgang thierse , left , speaks with reporters during wednesday 's opening ceremony . the president of the bundestag assured them of his support in finding a solution to the dispute .
“ if compensation claims are justified , they will have to be recognized and enforced appropriately , ” thierse said . compensating wertheim ’ s descendants or legal successors ? even if germany ends up offering more money for the land , it ’ s still unclear whether wertheim ’ s heirs will receive it .
that 's because the family is embroiled in a seperate legal battle with german retailing giant karstadtquelle . karstadt-quelle also claims ownership of the land on which the new library stands : in 1994 , the company took over competitor hertie , which in turn had bought the remaining wertheim assets in 1952 .
the descendants received about € 20,000 . “ karstadt still profits from our family ’ s name and heritage , ” principe said during a news conference on wednesday , adding that karstadt was trying to keep the wertheim descendants from receiving adequate compensation for the property in eastern germany . a karstadt spokesman told dw-world that the company will continue to pursue its claims to the wertheim property . in a separate matter , principe and her relatives have filed a civil law suit against karstadtquelle in the u.s. and are seeking several hundred million dollars in compensation for another property on berlin ’ s swanky potsdamer platz .
a court decision in the case is expected next spring . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin - the resurrected capital dw-world 's series on berlin 's renaissance as a capital city after german reunification .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .

the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .

as representatives from 125 nations prepare to sign a u.n. convention against corruption on tuesday , german parliamentarians find themselves split on whether stricter laws would help prevent corruption among their ranks . most countries have already banned their parliamentarians from accepting kickbacks in exchange for votes .
members of germany ’ s bundestag , however , only get in trouble if they receive so-called “ thank you gifts ” before casting their vote .
remuneration after the fact , known as a “ you ’ re welcome gift , ” is not considered a crime . the signing of the united nations document , which also aims to improve the prevention of cross-border corruption such as the elf aquitaine scandal , puts pressure on germany to fix this loophole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , supports stricter anti-corruption laws for parliamentarians .
germany ’ s justice ministry , headed by brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- , agrees that this needs to happen .
the u.n. convention , which took three years to hammer out , will have to be ratified by at least 30 countries before entering into force .

the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france . calling the decision “ essential ” to washington ’ s security interests , deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said washington had drawn up a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . “ it is necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the united states to limit competition for the prime contracts for these procurements , ” wolfowitz said in a statement .
“ an unsuccessful reconstruction effort would have serious negative effects on the ultimate success of the war effort . ” the move makes good on a warning from the bush administration that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . russia and canada , which stood with germany and france against the war , will also be barred from the 26 contracts for iraq ’ s electricity , communications , water and transportation infrastructure .

the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france . calling the decision “ essential ” to washington ’ s security interests , deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said washington had drawn up a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . “ it is necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the united states to limit competition for the prime contracts for these procurements , ” wolfowitz said in a statement .
“ an unsuccessful reconstruction effort would have serious negative effects on the ultimate success of the war effort . ” the move makes good on a warning from the bush administration that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . russia and canada , which stood with germany and france against the war , will also be barred from the 26 contracts for iraq ’ s electricity , communications , water and transportation infrastructure .
firms from all countries , however , will be eligible for smaller work as subcontractors . no troops from germany or france wolfowitz ’ s announcement comes after political leaders on both sides of the atlantic had made considerable effort to show the row over iraq had been overcome .
but u.s. president george bush has been unable to convince german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac to send troops to help stabilize the country . u.s. sen. joseph r. biden , the leading democrat on the senate foreign relations committee , said in a statement released tuesday the decision to bar countries from the reconstruction effort was a “ totally gratuitous slap that does nothing to protect our security interests and everything to alienate countries we need with us in iraq . ” but wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , pointing out that u.s. troop levels had fallen by 12,000 as non-u.s. forces had increased from 14,000 to 23,7000 in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz “ limiting competition for prime contracts will encourage the expansion of international cooperation in iraq and in future efforts , ” he said . although there was no official comment from berlin or paris on wednesday , canadian deputy prime minister john manley told the associated press the decision to exclude canada ’ s companies could jeopardize ottawa ’ s financial support for the rebuilding of iraq .
canada has so far earmarked $ 190 million for iraqi reconstruction aid . “ to exclude canadians just because they are canadians would be unacceptable if they accept funds from canadian taxpayers for the reconstruction of iraq , ” manley said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german patriotism : the road to berlin goes via baghdad george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .

daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen e. schrempp testified before a u.s. federal court that there were never any secret plans for a take over of chrysler .
what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s. 's third-largest car manufacturer , chrysler , with germany 's daimler-benz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- photo -rrb- claims that daimler-benz presented the $ 36 billion deal as a merger of equals , when really it was a secret take over bid .
he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .
he said it was only in the second half of 2000 that problems with chrysler 's management began to emerge - problems that had nothing to do with the merger . another top daimlerchrysler official , hilmar kopper , said in a taped deposition that it only then became clear that chrysler lacked competent management , meaning that the company had no choice but to fill executive positions with german executives instead of americans . " we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons . " when asked about the interview in court , schrempp said : " we were in an extremely difficult situation , we were hammered by the media for the performance of the company , particularly chrysler , and there was talk all around that the merger had n't worked .

daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen e. schrempp testified before a u.s. federal court that there were never any secret plans for a take over of chrysler .
what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s.

" we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
along with several relatives , principe attended wednesday ’ s opening ceremony at thierse ’ s invitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , right , talks to her lawyer as bundestag president wolfgang thierse , left , speaks with reporters during wednesday 's opening ceremony . the president of the bundestag assured them of his support in finding a solution to the dispute .
“ if compensation claims are justified , they will have to be recognized and enforced appropriately , ” thierse said . compensating wertheim ’ s descendants or legal successors ? even if germany ends up offering more money for the land , it ’ s still unclear whether wertheim ’ s heirs will receive it .
that 's because the family is embroiled in a seperate legal battle with german retailing giant karstadtquelle . karstadt-quelle also claims ownership of the land on which the new library stands : in 1994 , the company took over competitor hertie , which in turn had bought the remaining wertheim assets in 1952 .
the descendants received about € 20,000 . “ karstadt still profits from our family ’ s name and heritage , ” principe said during a news conference on wednesday , adding that karstadt was trying to keep the wertheim descendants from receiving adequate compensation for the property in eastern germany . a karstadt spokesman told dw-world that the company will continue to pursue its claims to the wertheim property . in a separate matter , principe and her relatives have filed a civil law suit against karstadtquelle in the u.s. and are seeking several hundred million dollars in compensation for another property on berlin ’ s swanky potsdamer platz .
a court decision in the case is expected next spring . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin - the resurrected capital dw-world 's series on berlin 's renaissance as a capital city after german reunification .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .
' ' you want your results to have wide applicability , " said cornelius diamond , the chief executive officer of a san diego-based biotech company , prediction sciences . just who will access the data , and how well will the database be protected ?

whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain . the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires important legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of schröder ’ s so-called “ agenda 2010 ” will be decided in a mediation committee representing germany ’ s two houses of parliament .

the 32-member mediation committee will have to wade through nearly 3,000 pages of legislation broken up into 15 separate parts . although there has been no official confirmation , there is speculation that schröder will meet with top members of the opposition to thrash out an agreement .

the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain . the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires important legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of schröder ’ s so-called “ agenda 2010 ” will be decided in a mediation committee representing germany ’ s two houses of parliament .
starting wednesday , the crucial talks will run through next monday . “ we still remain far apart on many important issues , ” volker kauder , the top negotiator for the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the afp news agency .
kauder said the chances of reaching a deal stood at “ fifty-fifty . ” schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the bundesrat – controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . schröder 's fate a package of sweeping reforms designed to kickstart growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state , schröder has tied his political future to the passage of agenda 2010 .
accordingly , members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have adopted an optimistic and conciliatory tone with the start of the talks . “ decisive will be whether we move towards each other .
and that we do , ” spd negotiator and bremen mayor henning scherf told journalists on wednesday . the opposition remains loath to give schröder a political victory he so desperately needs at the moment as the spd hovers at all-time lows in opinion polls .
but the conservatives are also aware that blocking the reforms could backfire at a time when germany ’ s is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . being negotiated are plans to bring forward tax cuts worth € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- by a year to 2004 and cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
along with several relatives , principe attended wednesday ’ s opening ceremony at thierse ’ s invitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , right , talks to her lawyer as bundestag president wolfgang thierse , left , speaks with reporters during wednesday 's opening ceremony . the president of the bundestag assured them of his support in finding a solution to the dispute .
“ if compensation claims are justified , they will have to be recognized and enforced appropriately , ” thierse said . compensating wertheim ’ s descendants or legal successors ? even if germany ends up offering more money for the land , it ’ s still unclear whether wertheim ’ s heirs will receive it .
that 's because the family is embroiled in a seperate legal battle with german retailing giant karstadtquelle . karstadt-quelle also claims ownership of the land on which the new library stands : in 1994 , the company took over competitor hertie , which in turn had bought the remaining wertheim assets in 1952 .
the descendants received about € 20,000 . “ karstadt still profits from our family ’ s name and heritage , ” principe said during a news conference on wednesday , adding that karstadt was trying to keep the wertheim descendants from receiving adequate compensation for the property in eastern germany . a karstadt spokesman told dw-world that the company will continue to pursue its claims to the wertheim property . in a separate matter , principe and her relatives have filed a civil law suit against karstadtquelle in the u.s. and are seeking several hundred million dollars in compensation for another property on berlin ’ s swanky potsdamer platz .

the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france . calling the decision “ essential ” to washington ’ s security interests , deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said washington had drawn up a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . “ it is necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the united states to limit competition for the prime contracts for these procurements , ” wolfowitz said in a statement .

daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen e. schrempp testified before a u.s. federal court that there were never any secret plans for a take over of chrysler .
what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s. 's third-largest car manufacturer , chrysler , with germany 's daimler-benz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- photo -rrb- claims that daimler-benz presented the $ 36 billion deal as a merger of equals , when really it was a secret take over bid .
he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .
he said it was only in the second half of 2000 that problems with chrysler 's management began to emerge - problems that had nothing to do with the merger . another top daimlerchrysler official , hilmar kopper , said in a taped deposition that it only then became clear that chrysler lacked competent management , meaning that the company had no choice but to fill executive positions with german executives instead of americans . " we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons . " when asked about the interview in court , schrempp said : " we were in an extremely difficult situation , we were hammered by the media for the performance of the company , particularly chrysler , and there was talk all around that the merger had n't worked .

the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain . the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires important legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of schröder ’ s so-called “ agenda 2010 ” will be decided in a mediation committee representing germany ’ s two houses of parliament .
starting wednesday , the crucial talks will run through next monday . “ we still remain far apart on many important issues , ” volker kauder , the top negotiator for the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the afp news agency .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .
' ' you want your results to have wide applicability , " said cornelius diamond , the chief executive officer of a san diego-based biotech company , prediction sciences . just who will access the data , and how well will the database be protected ?

daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen e. schrempp testified before a u.s. federal court that there were never any secret plans for a take over of chrysler .
what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s. 's third-largest car manufacturer , chrysler , with germany 's daimler-benz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- photo -rrb- claims that daimler-benz presented the $ 36 billion deal as a merger of equals , when really it was a secret take over bid .
he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .
he said it was only in the second half of 2000 that problems with chrysler 's management began to emerge - problems that had nothing to do with the merger . another top daimlerchrysler official , hilmar kopper , said in a taped deposition that it only then became clear that chrysler lacked competent management , meaning that the company had no choice but to fill executive positions with german executives instead of americans . " we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons .

what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s. 's third-largest car manufacturer , chrysler , with germany 's daimler-benz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- photo -rrb- claims that daimler-benz presented the $ 36 billion deal as a merger of equals , when really it was a secret take over bid .
he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .
he said it was only in the second half of 2000 that problems with chrysler 's management began to emerge - problems that had nothing to do with the merger . another top daimlerchrysler official , hilmar kopper , said in a taped deposition that it only then became clear that chrysler lacked competent management , meaning that the company had no choice but to fill executive positions with german executives instead of americans . " we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons . " when asked about the interview in court , schrempp said : " we were in an extremely difficult situation , we were hammered by the media for the performance of the company , particularly chrysler , and there was talk all around that the merger had n't worked .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .
' ' you want your results to have wide applicability , " said cornelius diamond , the chief executive officer of a san diego-based biotech company , prediction sciences . just who will access the data , and how well will the database be protected ?
ethical concerns remain . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links estonia genome project home page feedback do you think estonia 's database is a worthwhile endeavor for the small baltic country ?

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .
' ' you want your results to have wide applicability , " said cornelius diamond , the chief executive officer of a san diego-based biotech company , prediction sciences . just who will access the data , and how well will the database be protected ?
ethical concerns remain . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links estonia genome project home page feedback do you think estonia 's database is a worthwhile endeavor for the small baltic country ?

by comparing the effectiveness of the pills to the genetic material of the donors , the company hopes to find out why the medication works for one person but not the other .
' ' we 're basically predicting a person 's response to the drug , " diamond said . if estonia 's project is to survive , it needs many more diamonds , estonian genome project officials acknowledged .
the company charged with finding them is egeen , an estonian-led start-up in the san francisco bay area that holds the commercial rights to the database .
kalev kask , egeen 's ceo and a native estonian , cut his teeth in the turbulent silicon valley biotech industry .
he acknowledged the less-than-ideal investment climate currently for biotech ventures , but said the clinical drug trials underway in estonia are exactly the type of thing that will attract pharmaceutial companies .
' ' the climate is such that you better come up with something that has short-term economic return , " he said .
in addition to money concerns , the project has yielded its fair share of ethical questions as well .
after decades under what they call the ' ' soviet occupation , " some estonians are wary of the orwellian request to put their most personal information in the hands of a few people .
privacy and ethical concerns remain ' ' the project goes to your very basic being , an area that is very private , " said tiit veeber , 54 , a tartu businessman .
' ' these couple of people control the data . . . .
what will they do with that data ?
and do they have a right to sell it ? "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lab worker separating dna to stem these concerns , the estonian government passed a law in 2000 that requires gene donors to sign a contract giving their consent .
anyone caught misusing gene donor information faces criminal prosecution .
the law also ensures gene donor information and their blood samples are separated and forbids companies or researchers from taking the information out of the country , ensuring that the data does n't fall into the wrong hands .
as to whether egeen has a right to make money off of someone 's genetic material , metspalu said the project 's altruistic motives far outweigh any financial ones .
' ' it 's our turn to put something into this collective pool of knowledge , " he said .
if people make money off of it , ' ' then so be it : this is putting estonia on the map .

as representatives from 125 nations prepare to sign a u.n. convention against corruption on tuesday , german parliamentarians find themselves split on whether stricter laws would help prevent corruption among their ranks . most countries have already banned their parliamentarians from accepting kickbacks in exchange for votes .
members of germany ’ s bundestag , however , only get in trouble if they receive so-called “ thank you gifts ” before casting their vote .
remuneration after the fact , known as a “ you ’ re welcome gift , ” is not considered a crime . the signing of the united nations document , which also aims to improve the prevention of cross-border corruption such as the elf aquitaine scandal , puts pressure on germany to fix this loophole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , supports stricter anti-corruption laws for parliamentarians .
germany ’ s justice ministry , headed by brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- , agrees that this needs to happen .
the u.n. convention , which took three years to hammer out , will have to be ratified by at least 30 countries before entering into force .
it has been described as a milestone for global efforts to combat graft and will be signed by government representatives during a three-day u.n. conference that starts on tuesday in merida , mexico . but german parliamentarians , who will ultimately have to vote on changing the law , disagree on whether such a step will help to clamp down on corruption . too difficult to prosecute corruption ? “ we need a clearer separation between corruption among parliamentarians and their legal representation of interests , ” klaus uwe benneter , a social democratic member of parliament who sits on the legal affairs committee , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . norbert geis , the opposition christian social union ’ s spokesman on legal affairs , countered that it would be hard to prosecute corruption in parliament .
some of his conservative colleagues agreed . a stricter law on combating corruption would lead to more investigations but not more convictions , eckart von klaeden of the christian democratic union ’ s parliamentary leadership told the berliner zeitung . even under current law , no german parliamentarian has been prosecuted for corruption .
in its 2003 corruption perception index , transparency international , a non-governmental organization that monitors worldwide corruption , ranked germany in 16th place , behind singapore and hong kong . parliamentarians ’ side jobs criticized while calling upon german parliamentarians to get tougher on themselves , transparency international also criticized the number of side jobs many lawmakers have here .
moonlighting “ could lead to political dependencies which eventually affect the parliamentarian ’ s decision-making process , ” dagmar schröder , executive director of the organization 's german chapter , told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the u.s. house of representatives are banned from any side jobs during their term in office .
in the u.s. , members of the house of representatives are banned from any side jobs , including such things as serving on company advisory boards .
germany ’ s members of parliament on the other hand are only required to make public such sources of extra income . moonlighting parliamentarians more independent ? some of the bundestag ’ s biggest moonlighters disagreed with schröder ’ s assessment .
günter rexrodt , a former minister of economics and member of the opposition free liberal democrats , said he saw nothing wrong with lawmakers earning some extra money on the side .
“ it ’ s a good thing if parliamentarians are in touch with life , ” rexrodt told the berliner zeitung .
he added that parliamentarians with side jobs were much more relaxed and more independent . just last week , a green party member of parliament resigned from her positions as advisory board member with several insurance companies after her own party colleagues criticized her for it .
but cornelia scheel , who heads the parliament ’ s finance committee , said she did nothing wrong and only resigned from the boards because she was tired of having to deal with the mounting criticism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany improves fight against corruption according to a report published by the organization transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , germany has made small steps towards wiping out corruption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.12.2003 new german patriotism : the road to berlin goes via baghdad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin band mia dressed in the national colors of germany .
george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .

george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .
it claims that those who live in tax havens are " unpatriotic " at a time when the economy could do with their euros .

while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .

george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.12.2003 estonia sees its future in genes 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab worker separates dna from solution in the lab in tartu , estonia .
the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .
' ' you want your results to have wide applicability , " said cornelius diamond , the chief executive officer of a san diego-based biotech company , prediction sciences . just who will access the data , and how well will the database be protected ?
ethical concerns remain . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links estonia genome project home page feedback do you think estonia 's database is a worthwhile endeavor for the small baltic country ?

the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain . the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires important legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of schröder ’ s so-called “ agenda 2010 ” will be decided in a mediation committee representing germany ’ s two houses of parliament .
starting wednesday , the crucial talks will run through next monday . “ we still remain far apart on many important issues , ” volker kauder , the top negotiator for the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the afp news agency .
kauder said the chances of reaching a deal stood at “ fifty-fifty . ” schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the bundesrat – controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . schröder 's fate a package of sweeping reforms designed to kickstart growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state , schröder has tied his political future to the passage of agenda 2010 .
accordingly , members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have adopted an optimistic and conciliatory tone with the start of the talks . “ decisive will be whether we move towards each other .
and that we do , ” spd negotiator and bremen mayor henning scherf told journalists on wednesday . the opposition remains loath to give schröder a political victory he so desperately needs at the moment as the spd hovers at all-time lows in opinion polls .
but the conservatives are also aware that blocking the reforms could backfire at a time when germany ’ s is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . being negotiated are plans to bring forward tax cuts worth € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- by a year to 2004 and cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits .
the 32-member mediation committee will have to wade through nearly 3,000 pages of legislation broken up into 15 separate parts . although there has been no official confirmation , there is speculation that schröder will meet with top members of the opposition to thrash out an agreement .
but cdu party leader angela merkel has warned against putting too much hope in high-level talks and has called on the government to negotiate in the mediation committee . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 100,000 protest german reforms in berlin tens of thousands marched through germany ’ s capital city on saturday to voice their opinions against painful cuts to the government-subsidized public healthcare system and reforms to the labor market .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
along with several relatives , principe attended wednesday ’ s opening ceremony at thierse ’ s invitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , right , talks to her lawyer as bundestag president wolfgang thierse , left , speaks with reporters during wednesday 's opening ceremony . the president of the bundestag assured them of his support in finding a solution to the dispute .
“ if compensation claims are justified , they will have to be recognized and enforced appropriately , ” thierse said . compensating wertheim ’ s descendants or legal successors ? even if germany ends up offering more money for the land , it ’ s still unclear whether wertheim ’ s heirs will receive it .
that 's because the family is embroiled in a seperate legal battle with german retailing giant karstadtquelle . karstadt-quelle also claims ownership of the land on which the new library stands : in 1994 , the company took over competitor hertie , which in turn had bought the remaining wertheim assets in 1952 .
the descendants received about € 20,000 . “ karstadt still profits from our family ’ s name and heritage , ” principe said during a news conference on wednesday , adding that karstadt was trying to keep the wertheim descendants from receiving adequate compensation for the property in eastern germany . a karstadt spokesman told dw-world that the company will continue to pursue its claims to the wertheim property . in a separate matter , principe and her relatives have filed a civil law suit against karstadtquelle in the u.s. and are seeking several hundred million dollars in compensation for another property on berlin ’ s swanky potsdamer platz .

as representatives from 125 nations prepare to sign a u.n. convention against corruption on tuesday , german parliamentarians find themselves split on whether stricter laws would help prevent corruption among their ranks . most countries have already banned their parliamentarians from accepting kickbacks in exchange for votes .
members of germany ’ s bundestag , however , only get in trouble if they receive so-called “ thank you gifts ” before casting their vote .
remuneration after the fact , known as a “ you ’ re welcome gift , ” is not considered a crime . the signing of the united nations document , which also aims to improve the prevention of cross-border corruption such as the elf aquitaine scandal , puts pressure on germany to fix this loophole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , supports stricter anti-corruption laws for parliamentarians .
germany ’ s justice ministry , headed by brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- , agrees that this needs to happen .
the u.n. convention , which took three years to hammer out , will have to be ratified by at least 30 countries before entering into force .
it has been described as a milestone for global efforts to combat graft and will be signed by government representatives during a three-day u.n. conference that starts on tuesday in merida , mexico . but german parliamentarians , who will ultimately have to vote on changing the law , disagree on whether such a step will help to clamp down on corruption . too difficult to prosecute corruption ? “ we need a clearer separation between corruption among parliamentarians and their legal representation of interests , ” klaus uwe benneter , a social democratic member of parliament who sits on the legal affairs committee , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . norbert geis , the opposition christian social union ’ s spokesman on legal affairs , countered that it would be hard to prosecute corruption in parliament .
some of his conservative colleagues agreed . a stricter law on combating corruption would lead to more investigations but not more convictions , eckart von klaeden of the christian democratic union ’ s parliamentary leadership told the berliner zeitung . even under current law , no german parliamentarian has been prosecuted for corruption .
in its 2003 corruption perception index , transparency international , a non-governmental organization that monitors worldwide corruption , ranked germany in 16th place , behind singapore and hong kong . parliamentarians ’ side jobs criticized while calling upon german parliamentarians to get tougher on themselves , transparency international also criticized the number of side jobs many lawmakers have here .
moonlighting “ could lead to political dependencies which eventually affect the parliamentarian ’ s decision-making process , ” dagmar schröder , executive director of the organization 's german chapter , told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the u.s. house of representatives are banned from any side jobs during their term in office .
in the u.s. , members of the house of representatives are banned from any side jobs , including such things as serving on company advisory boards .
germany ’ s members of parliament on the other hand are only required to make public such sources of extra income . moonlighting parliamentarians more independent ? some of the bundestag ’ s biggest moonlighters disagreed with schröder ’ s assessment .
günter rexrodt , a former minister of economics and member of the opposition free liberal democrats , said he saw nothing wrong with lawmakers earning some extra money on the side .
“ it ’ s a good thing if parliamentarians are in touch with life , ” rexrodt told the berliner zeitung .
he added that parliamentarians with side jobs were much more relaxed and more independent . just last week , a green party member of parliament resigned from her positions as advisory board member with several insurance companies after her own party colleagues criticized her for it .
but cornelia scheel , who heads the parliament ’ s finance committee , said she did nothing wrong and only resigned from the boards because she was tired of having to deal with the mounting criticism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany improves fight against corruption according to a report published by the organization transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , germany has made small steps towards wiping out corruption .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
along with several relatives , principe attended wednesday ’ s opening ceremony at thierse ’ s invitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , right , talks to her lawyer as bundestag president wolfgang thierse , left , speaks with reporters during wednesday 's opening ceremony . the president of the bundestag assured them of his support in finding a solution to the dispute .
“ if compensation claims are justified , they will have to be recognized and enforced appropriately , ” thierse said . compensating wertheim ’ s descendants or legal successors ? even if germany ends up offering more money for the land , it ’ s still unclear whether wertheim ’ s heirs will receive it .
that 's because the family is embroiled in a seperate legal battle with german retailing giant karstadtquelle . karstadt-quelle also claims ownership of the land on which the new library stands : in 1994 , the company took over competitor hertie , which in turn had bought the remaining wertheim assets in 1952 .
the descendants received about € 20,000 . “ karstadt still profits from our family ’ s name and heritage , ” principe said during a news conference on wednesday , adding that karstadt was trying to keep the wertheim descendants from receiving adequate compensation for the property in eastern germany . a karstadt spokesman told dw-world that the company will continue to pursue its claims to the wertheim property . in a separate matter , principe and her relatives have filed a civil law suit against karstadtquelle in the u.s. and are seeking several hundred million dollars in compensation for another property on berlin ’ s swanky potsdamer platz .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
along with several relatives , principe attended wednesday ’ s opening ceremony at thierse ’ s invitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , right , talks to her lawyer as bundestag president wolfgang thierse , left , speaks with reporters during wednesday 's opening ceremony . the president of the bundestag assured them of his support in finding a solution to the dispute .
“ if compensation claims are justified , they will have to be recognized and enforced appropriately , ” thierse said . compensating wertheim ’ s descendants or legal successors ? even if germany ends up offering more money for the land , it ’ s still unclear whether wertheim ’ s heirs will receive it .
that 's because the family is embroiled in a seperate legal battle with german retailing giant karstadtquelle . karstadt-quelle also claims ownership of the land on which the new library stands : in 1994 , the company took over competitor hertie , which in turn had bought the remaining wertheim assets in 1952 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.12.2003 estonia sees its future in genes 1/2 ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a lab worker separates dna from solution in the lab in tartu , estonia .
the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .
' ' you want your results to have wide applicability , " said cornelius diamond , the chief executive officer of a san diego-based biotech company , prediction sciences . just who will access the data , and how well will the database be protected ?
ethical concerns remain . 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links estonia genome project home page feedback do you think estonia 's database is a worthwhile endeavor for the small baltic country ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 10.12.2003 german lawmakers uneasy about stricter anti-corruption laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a glass dome tops germany 's parliament , but will its members offer the same level of transparency ?
as representatives from 125 nations prepare to sign a u.n. convention against corruption on tuesday , german parliamentarians find themselves split on whether stricter laws would help prevent corruption among their ranks . most countries have already banned their parliamentarians from accepting kickbacks in exchange for votes .
members of germany ’ s bundestag , however , only get in trouble if they receive so-called “ thank you gifts ” before casting their vote .
remuneration after the fact , known as a “ you ’ re welcome gift , ” is not considered a crime . the signing of the united nations document , which also aims to improve the prevention of cross-border corruption such as the elf aquitaine scandal , puts pressure on germany to fix this loophole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , supports stricter anti-corruption laws for parliamentarians .
germany ’ s justice ministry , headed by brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- , agrees that this needs to happen .
the u.n. convention , which took three years to hammer out , will have to be ratified by at least 30 countries before entering into force .
it has been described as a milestone for global efforts to combat graft and will be signed by government representatives during a three-day u.n. conference that starts on tuesday in merida , mexico . but german parliamentarians , who will ultimately have to vote on changing the law , disagree on whether such a step will help to clamp down on corruption . too difficult to prosecute corruption ? “ we need a clearer separation between corruption among parliamentarians and their legal representation of interests , ” klaus uwe benneter , a social democratic member of parliament who sits on the legal affairs committee , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . norbert geis , the opposition christian social union ’ s spokesman on legal affairs , countered that it would be hard to prosecute corruption in parliament .
some of his conservative colleagues agreed . a stricter law on combating corruption would lead to more investigations but not more convictions , eckart von klaeden of the christian democratic union ’ s parliamentary leadership told the berliner zeitung . even under current law , no german parliamentarian has been prosecuted for corruption .
in its 2003 corruption perception index , transparency international , a non-governmental organization that monitors worldwide corruption , ranked germany in 16th place , behind singapore and hong kong . parliamentarians ’ side jobs criticized while calling upon german parliamentarians to get tougher on themselves , transparency international also criticized the number of side jobs many lawmakers have here .
moonlighting “ could lead to political dependencies which eventually affect the parliamentarian ’ s decision-making process , ” dagmar schröder , executive director of the organization 's german chapter , told the stuttgarter nachrichten newspaper . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the u.s. house of representatives are banned from any side jobs during their term in office .
in the u.s. , members of the house of representatives are banned from any side jobs , including such things as serving on company advisory boards .
germany ’ s members of parliament on the other hand are only required to make public such sources of extra income . moonlighting parliamentarians more independent ? some of the bundestag ’ s biggest moonlighters disagreed with schröder ’ s assessment .
günter rexrodt , a former minister of economics and member of the opposition free liberal democrats , said he saw nothing wrong with lawmakers earning some extra money on the side .
“ it ’ s a good thing if parliamentarians are in touch with life , ” rexrodt told the berliner zeitung .
he added that parliamentarians with side jobs were much more relaxed and more independent . just last week , a green party member of parliament resigned from her positions as advisory board member with several insurance companies after her own party colleagues criticized her for it .
but cornelia scheel , who heads the parliament ’ s finance committee , said she did nothing wrong and only resigned from the boards because she was tired of having to deal with the mounting criticism . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany improves fight against corruption according to a report published by the organization transparency international -lrb- ti -rrb- , germany has made small steps towards wiping out corruption .

the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain . the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires important legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of schröder ’ s so-called “ agenda 2010 ” will be decided in a mediation committee representing germany ’ s two houses of parliament .
starting wednesday , the crucial talks will run through next monday . “ we still remain far apart on many important issues , ” volker kauder , the top negotiator for the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the afp news agency .
kauder said the chances of reaching a deal stood at “ fifty-fifty . ” schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the bundesrat – controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . schröder 's fate a package of sweeping reforms designed to kickstart growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state , schröder has tied his political future to the passage of agenda 2010 .
accordingly , members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have adopted an optimistic and conciliatory tone with the start of the talks . “ decisive will be whether we move towards each other .
and that we do , ” spd negotiator and bremen mayor henning scherf told journalists on wednesday . the opposition remains loath to give schröder a political victory he so desperately needs at the moment as the spd hovers at all-time lows in opinion polls .
but the conservatives are also aware that blocking the reforms could backfire at a time when germany ’ s is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . being negotiated are plans to bring forward tax cuts worth € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- by a year to 2004 and cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits .
the 32-member mediation committee will have to wade through nearly 3,000 pages of legislation broken up into 15 separate parts . although there has been no official confirmation , there is speculation that schröder will meet with top members of the opposition to thrash out an agreement .

as representatives from 125 nations prepare to sign a u.n. convention against corruption on tuesday , german parliamentarians find themselves split on whether stricter laws would help prevent corruption among their ranks . most countries have already banned their parliamentarians from accepting kickbacks in exchange for votes .
members of germany ’ s bundestag , however , only get in trouble if they receive so-called “ thank you gifts ” before casting their vote .

the u.n. convention , which took three years to hammer out , will have to be ratified by at least 30 countries before entering into force .
it has been described as a milestone for global efforts to combat graft and will be signed by government representatives during a three-day u.n. conference that starts on tuesday in merida , mexico . but german parliamentarians , who will ultimately have to vote on changing the law , disagree on whether such a step will help to clamp down on corruption . too difficult to prosecute corruption ? “ we need a clearer separation between corruption among parliamentarians and their legal representation of interests , ” klaus uwe benneter , a social democratic member of parliament who sits on the legal affairs committee , told the berliner zeitung newspaper . norbert geis , the opposition christian social union ’ s spokesman on legal affairs , countered that it would be hard to prosecute corruption in parliament .

as representatives from 125 nations prepare to sign a u.n. convention against corruption on tuesday , german parliamentarians find themselves split on whether stricter laws would help prevent corruption among their ranks . most countries have already banned their parliamentarians from accepting kickbacks in exchange for votes .
members of germany ’ s bundestag , however , only get in trouble if they receive so-called “ thank you gifts ” before casting their vote .
remuneration after the fact , known as a “ you ’ re welcome gift , ” is not considered a crime . the signing of the united nations document , which also aims to improve the prevention of cross-border corruption such as the elf aquitaine scandal , puts pressure on germany to fix this loophole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german justice minister brigitte zypries , a social democrat , supports stricter anti-corruption laws for parliamentarians .
germany ’ s justice ministry , headed by brigitte zypries -lrb- photo -rrb- , agrees that this needs to happen .
the u.n. convention , which took three years to hammer out , will have to be ratified by at least 30 countries before entering into force .

the german government wednesday began a last ditch effort to pass chancellor schröder ’ s key economic and welfare reforms before christmas .
whether the conservative opposition will back the proposals is far from certain . the nature of germany ’ s federal system often requires important legislation to be approved by the country ’ s 16 states , which means the fate of schröder ’ s so-called “ agenda 2010 ” will be decided in a mediation committee representing germany ’ s two houses of parliament .
starting wednesday , the crucial talks will run through next monday . “ we still remain far apart on many important issues , ” volker kauder , the top negotiator for the opposition conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , told the afp news agency .
kauder said the chances of reaching a deal stood at “ fifty-fifty . ” schröder ’ s center-left coalition of social democrats and greens passed labor market reforms and tax cuts in october in the lower house , but the bundesrat – controlled by the conservatives and free-market liberals – rejected them last month .
that ’ s set the stage for a high-stakes legislative poker match that will determine the fate of the biggest reform process in germany in recent history . schröder 's fate a package of sweeping reforms designed to kickstart growth and trim the country ’ s bloated welfare state , schröder has tied his political future to the passage of agenda 2010 .
accordingly , members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have adopted an optimistic and conciliatory tone with the start of the talks . “ decisive will be whether we move towards each other .
and that we do , ” spd negotiator and bremen mayor henning scherf told journalists on wednesday . the opposition remains loath to give schröder a political victory he so desperately needs at the moment as the spd hovers at all-time lows in opinion polls .
but the conservatives are also aware that blocking the reforms could backfire at a time when germany ’ s is suffering from low growth and high unemployment . being negotiated are plans to bring forward tax cuts worth € 15.6 billion -lrb- $ 12.7 billion -rrb- by a year to 2004 and cuts in welfare and unemployment benefits .
the 32-member mediation committee will have to wade through nearly 3,000 pages of legislation broken up into 15 separate parts . although there has been no official confirmation , there is speculation that schröder will meet with top members of the opposition to thrash out an agreement .

daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen e. schrempp testified before a u.s. federal court that there were never any secret plans for a take over of chrysler .
what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s. 's third-largest car manufacturer , chrysler , with germany 's daimler-benz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- photo -rrb- claims that daimler-benz presented the $ 36 billion deal as a merger of equals , when really it was a secret take over bid .
he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .
he said it was only in the second half of 2000 that problems with chrysler 's management began to emerge - problems that had nothing to do with the merger . another top daimlerchrysler official , hilmar kopper , said in a taped deposition that it only then became clear that chrysler lacked competent management , meaning that the company had no choice but to fill executive positions with german executives instead of americans . " we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons . " when asked about the interview in court , schrempp said : " we were in an extremely difficult situation , we were hammered by the media for the performance of the company , particularly chrysler , and there was talk all around that the merger had n't worked .

what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s.

the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france . calling the decision “ essential ” to washington ’ s security interests , deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said washington had drawn up a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . “ it is necessary for the protection of the essential security interests of the united states to limit competition for the prime contracts for these procurements , ” wolfowitz said in a statement .
“ an unsuccessful reconstruction effort would have serious negative effects on the ultimate success of the war effort . ” the move makes good on a warning from the bush administration that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . russia and canada , which stood with germany and france against the war , will also be barred from the 26 contracts for iraq ’ s electricity , communications , water and transportation infrastructure .
firms from all countries , however , will be eligible for smaller work as subcontractors . no troops from germany or france wolfowitz ’ s announcement comes after political leaders on both sides of the atlantic had made considerable effort to show the row over iraq had been overcome .
but u.s. president george bush has been unable to convince german chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac to send troops to help stabilize the country . u.s. sen. joseph r. biden , the leading democrat on the senate foreign relations committee , said in a statement released tuesday the decision to bar countries from the reconstruction effort was a “ totally gratuitous slap that does nothing to protect our security interests and everything to alienate countries we need with us in iraq . ” but wolfowitz said he hoped the action would put pressure on other nations to join the military efforts in iraq , pointing out that u.s. troop levels had fallen by 12,000 as non-u.s. forces had increased from 14,000 to 23,7000 in recent months . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz “ limiting competition for prime contracts will encourage the expansion of international cooperation in iraq and in future efforts , ” he said . although there was no official comment from berlin or paris on wednesday , canadian deputy prime minister john manley told the associated press the decision to exclude canada ’ s companies could jeopardize ottawa ’ s financial support for the rebuilding of iraq .
canada has so far earmarked $ 190 million for iraqi reconstruction aid . “ to exclude canadians just because they are canadians would be unacceptable if they accept funds from canadian taxpayers for the reconstruction of iraq , ” manley said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new german patriotism : the road to berlin goes via baghdad george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .

daimlerchrysler chief executive jürgen e. schrempp testified before a u.s. federal court that there were never any secret plans for a take over of chrysler .
what happened , he said , was a merger of equals . schrempp took the stand in a wilmington , delaware , court in a lawsuit brought by billionaire investor kirk kerkorian , who was chrysler 's largest shareholder before the 1998 merger of the u.s. 's third-largest car manufacturer , chrysler , with germany 's daimler-benz . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian .
kerkorian -lrb- photo -rrb- claims that daimler-benz presented the $ 36 billion deal as a merger of equals , when really it was a secret take over bid .
he is suing daimlerchrysler for as much as $ 3 billion in damages for stock losses . kerkorian says shareholders have been denied premiums that they would have been owed in the event of an acquisition .
schrempp maintained that there was never any attempt to deceive investors about the merger . " the description of a merger of equals is absolutely correct , " schrempp said .
" and by telling the truth , i do n't think i can defraud anyone . " chrysler 's troubles schrempp , whose testimony lasted over four hours , said that he personally was against any kind of " unfriendly actions , " including hostile take overs . during the questioning , which was handled by his own lawyers , schrempp traced the history of the merger in minute detail .
he said it was only in the second half of 2000 that problems with chrysler 's management began to emerge - problems that had nothing to do with the merger . another top daimlerchrysler official , hilmar kopper , said in a taped deposition that it only then became clear that chrysler lacked competent management , meaning that the company had no choice but to fill executive positions with german executives instead of americans . " we had all sorts of second thoughts about sending germans over ; we took it for granted that chrysler could always be run by americans , only to find that this did not come true , " kopper said . in 2000 , two former mercedes executives , dieter zetsche and wolfgang bernhard , were sent to take over the struggling chrysler group . at the time of the merger , eight chrysler officials and 10 daimler-benz officials sat on the management board . schrempp and the former chrysler chief executive , robert j. eaton initially shared the chairmanship . eaton has since retired , and as of january 2004 , the board will be comprised of 10 germans and one former chrysler official . according to kerkorian 's lead lawyer terry christensen , the lack of american influence over the company proves kerkorian 's claim that daimler-benz has effectively acquired chrysler . incriminating interview kerkorian launched the suit following an interview schrempp gave to the financial times in october 2000 , in which he suggested that he always intended for chrysler to be a division of the combined company , and that labeling the deal a merger of equals with equal representation of americans and germans on the board was done " for psychological reasons . " when asked about the interview in court , schrempp said : " we were in an extremely difficult situation , we were hammered by the media for the performance of the company , particularly chrysler , and there was talk all around that the merger had n't worked . " schrempp will be cross-examined on wednesday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de report clears daimlerchrysler of human rights violations a report commissioned by daimlerchrysler on its actions during the military dictatorship in argentina in the 1970s cleared the company of any wrongdoing .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .

george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .

the baltic country of estonia wants to put itself on the map by developing a genetic database of its population that could push drug development to a new level .
the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .

the response , so far , has been positive . tartu - the gooey strip of dna was visible underneath the halogen glow as dagni krinka tilted the tube of liquid back and forth under the light at a lab in this northernmost baltic country .
' ' this is the part of the work i like best , " krinka , the head of the laboratory assigned the daunting task of collecting genetic samples from hundreds of thousands of estonians in the coming years , told dw-world .
then , gazing at the strip , she asked , ' ' is n't it beautiful ? "
it could be much more than beautiful .
if this nation of 1.4 million succeeds in its ambitious goal to build one of the world 's largest dna databases , the stringy white gobs in dagni 's test tubes could push international drug development to a new level and bring international recognition to a country still playing catch up after decades of soviet rule . databases that will attract pill-makers two years after american scientists mapped the human genome , the chemical building blocks that make up humanity 's genetic heritage , estonia is caught up in the race to build large dna storage banks .
in iceland , the biotechnology company , decode , has been mining genetic data from 80,000 of that country 's population since 1999 and has found gene variations linked to heart disease and osteoporosis .
projects are also underway in canada , the u.s. and the united kingdom .
the goal of these various endeavors is to give scientists and pharmaceutical companies a big population of genetic material that they can scour for disease-causing genes , and use to test out the effectiveness of the medication we take when we get sick .
' ' it 's a resource for basic science , " said andres metspalu , a biotechnology professor at the university of tartu in estonia who began the estonian genome project in 1999 .
' ' but with good basic research , it can also lead to good economic benefits . " developing pills for europeans , americans money , scientific progress and international recognition are the three factors driving estonia 's plan forward .
since blood sampling began in october 2002 , the nonprofit estonian genome project foundation has collected dna from more than 3,000 estonians .
aided by just $ 4.5 million in private investment , the project hopes to have 10,000 samples by the end of the year .
over the next six years , estonian officials say , the number should be well into the hundreds of thousands at a cost of more than $ 100 million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : estonia wants to turn its population into a gold mine .
the project 's broad government and public support as well as health records good enough to create vital geneological maps make it attractive to researchers and companies looking for a reliable , accurate database .
adding to the attraction for potential drug developers , estonia has an especially diverse genetic makeup as a result of hundreds of years of occupation by russians , swedes , danes and germans .
' ' you want your results to have wide applicability , " said cornelius diamond , the chief executive officer of a san diego-based biotech company , prediction sciences . just who will access the data , and how well will the database be protected ?

in his suit , kirch claimed that comments made by the bank ’ s chief executive in early 2002 contributed to the demise of his group .
the munich court concurred .
before it ran out of money , kirsch was a giant in germany ’ s commercial television business .
the company filed for insolvency in april after banks withdrew their backing from the company in april 2002 .
the filing came after deutsche bank supervisory board chairman rolf breuer questioned the company ’ s creditworthiness in a television interview .
the judges ruled that deutsche bank was required to be more discreet about its client , and that damages were justified .
the court ’ s decision is final and not subject to appeal .
deutsche bank offered no comment on the ruling . more briefs 10.12.2003 -pipe- german exports drop in october 09.12.2003 -pipe- berlin introduces internet security campaign for companies 09.12.2003 -pipe- german travel industry miffed over new lufthansa pricing system 09.12.2003 -pipe- daimlerchrysler ceo testifies in fraud trial 08.12.2003 -pipe- economists forecast accelerated growth 08.12.2003 -pipe- germany to set up private financial regulator 06.12.2003 -pipe- siemens involved in nuclear row 05.12.2003 -pipe- nokia loses grip on western europe 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 10.12.2003 new german patriotism : the road to berlin goes via baghdad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin band mia dressed in the national colors of germany .
george bush may have hoped that a new national identity would emerge on the streets of baghdad following the u.s.-led invasion of iraq .
instead , the war has helped forge a new kind of patriotism in berlin . yes , germany , having already undergone a transformation from dictatorship to democracy under american stewardship after world war ii , is now being freed from the burdens of the past by the u.s. campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .

as strange as it may sound , bush ’ s decision to go to war with iraq has made it okay to be german again . long averse to displays of patriotism due to the excesses and crimes of the nazis , flag-waving outside of sporting events - either real or figuratively - has been largely taboo for this nation of 82 million .
but now many young germans have found new pride in the country ’ s prominent role along with france and russia in opposing the war in iraq . “ i thought ‘ wow ’ germany stands for peace .
it wasn ’ t always that way , you know , ” explained a 23-year-old singer from berlin who goes by the name mieze .
inspired by recent events , she has written a love song - not to a person , but to her country .
only a few years ago , such a move could have quickly ended the career of a promising musician in germany . a new fatherland but instead of rejecting the fatherland as left-leaning german youth have done for decades , a brave group of pioneers has begun to embrace a new concept of patriotism rooted in pacifism , tolerance and human rights .
and as the idea of a liberal and modern fatherland spreads , so too are the colors of the german flag - black , red and gold - beginning to show up in different aspects of society including fashion and music . the movement , if it can be called that , has proven to be a boon for cologne-based fashion designer eva gronbach , who for the past couple of years has created collections integrating black , red and gold along with other national symbols such as the german eagle .
far from just tapping into a growing trend , gronbach ’ s inspiration for the designs come from her own personal reconciliation with her country . after fleeing germany to study and work in london and paris , she eventually began to see her own vision of her country was as outdated as that of many foreigners .
the traditionally conservative images of the country did not represent modern germany ’ s open and tolerant multicultural society , and staid teutonic stereotypes had nothing in common with the country ’ s hip electronic music scene .
bildunterschrift : one of eva gronbach 's designs . “ people may now accuse me of just having a clever marketing strategy , but it ’ s a very personal and very honest thing for me , ” gronbach told dw-world . turning down a job with japanese designer yohji yamamoto in paris , she returned home to create a collection entitled “ a declaration of love to germany ” with nationally colored items for both men and women . “ i used to find the colors ugly , ” said gronbach .
“ but i thought maybe i could consciously change what they mean to me personally . ” breaking taboos but breaking the taboo was not easy .
she described how terrified she was when she first wore her designs on the street a few years ago .
now , with more and more of her generation rethinking what it means to be german , her designs are appearing not only on stylish people on the street , but also the cover of glossy national magazines . apparently sensing the nation ’ s changing attitudes , one new lifestyle publication has even gone so far as to call itself deutsch . “ if you consider the word ‘ deutsch ’ then it doesn ’ t have to stand for all of the tired prejudices that we know .
nowadays , it ’ s also a synonym for cosmopolitanism , pluralism and creativity and that ’ s what germany stands for overseas too , ” the magazine ’ s editor tim brandt said in a recent interview on german television . back in berlin , mieze ’ s band mia have chosen to splash black , red and gold across the cover of their latest album and the singer even uses the colors metaphorically in some of her song lyrics to describe how her own relationship to her country has changed over the past year . for her , a defining moment was when someone from her record label " respect or tolerate " told her of his trip to south america last year .
while there , the visiting german was frequently approached by a number of people to thank him for opposing the war simply because of his nationality . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mia 's singer mieze .
“ the song is my reaction to that moment , ” mieze said .
“ of course this is all something that one needs to approach in a sensitive manner , but i see it a great opportunity . ” the song also addresses the frequent self-loathing that many young germans experience growing up in the shadow of the country ’ s nazi past and how half a century later things may finally be changing : “ if someone asks me now where i ’ m from / i no longer feel sorry for myself / i ’ ll risk something for love / i feel as if i ’ m ready . ” a special obligation most germans believe the country has a special responsibility to work for peace and combat intolerance because of the holocaust and other crimes committed in their name during the world war ii .
but it would now appear that some of the new patriots are choosing to celebrate that responsibility instead of seeing it as a necessary burden like past generations . however , as some recent events show , it ’ s a difficult path to take , especially since germany ’ s past can quickly overshadow any discussion on patriotism .
only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .

only last month , a conservative member of the german bundestag was ejected from his party ’ s parliamentary group for allegedly making anti-jewish comments in a speech on october 3 , which is german unity day . in a misguided attempt to talk of “ justice for germany , ” martin hohmann , a christian democrat mp , said the label of being a “ race of perpetrators ” could equally apply to both germans and jews .
after a storm of public outrage , the christian democrats ’ party leader angela merkel moved to exclude him from the parliamentary group .
a separate effort to kick him out of the party entirely is still underway . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : “ we can define our self-esteem from both the positive and negative sides of our history without devaluing others , ” merkel told journalists after dealing with the hohmann affair .
“ there needs to be a broad debate about patriotism and love of the fatherland . ” but as the budding cultural phenomenon of the new german pride in fashion and music shows , merkel ’ s call for a national discussion on the topic is probably missing the point entirely .
anyone wearing one of eva gronbach ’ s black , red and gold creations would likely argue that the future of german patriotism doesn ’ t need to be debated - it ’ s already here . “ this change in the society is happening all by itself .
it doesn ’ t need anyone to help it along , ” said gronbach . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tax exile sports idols face political wrath germany 's multi-millionaire sports personalities have come under fire from their own government .

controversy surrounds the site of a new parliamentary library in berlin .
descendants of a jewish retailing dynasty want compensation because the building stands on their former land seized by the nazis . hailed as an architectural masterpiece , the newly-opened library forms part of the so-called “ federal ribbon , ” a row of government buildings stretching from the german chancellor ’ s office in the former west berlin to the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus in the former east .
“ where the wall once stood , democratically elected politicians now have their offices and their library – history could not have taken a better turn , ” said wolfgang thierse , the parliament ’ s president , during wednesday ’ s opening ceremony of the € 221 million -lrb- $ 270 million -rrb- building . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's " federal ribbon " is seen on the right edge of this photo and stretches from the new marie-elisabeth-lüders-haus to the chancellor 's office in the background .
to the left stands germany 's parliament building with its signature glass dome .
the library completes the € 10 billion move of germany ’ s government from the former capital bonn to berlin .
germany ’ s parliament had approved this in 1991 .
while berlin government offices opened for business in 1999 , ministries and many other agencies still have bonn offices as part of an agreement to keep bonn as a “ federal city . ” the new building at the heart of unified berlin will house the world ’ s third-largest parliamentary library after those in washington d.c. and tokyo .
about 1.3 million volumes and 11,000 journals will find their new home here . a symbol of unity or germany ’ s dark history ? while closed to the public , the building has the potential to serve as a symbolic bridge in a formerly divided city and country .
but instead a dispute over the land on which it stands has been evoking memories of a darker period of germany ’ s history . american heirs of the wertheim family , owners of one of europe ’ s biggest department store chains and large parts of central berlin before the nazis seized their property in 1937 , have asked for compensation for the 8,000 square meter -lrb- 86,111 square foot -rrb- site .
three members of the wertheim family died at the ausschwitz concentration camp during the holocaust and others fled abroad . the german finance ministry , which administers the land , has offered to pay wertheim ’ s descendants € 2.48 million , a fraction of its value – estimated at a minimum of € 18.26 million . ministry officials have argued that the sales price should be reduced by about € 5 million in clean-up costs and more than € 10 million germany had to pay to the holder of a lease on the land . parliament ’ s president supports heirs ’ claims “ the money ’ s just symbolic , but it still says something if what ’ s offered is far too little , ” wertheim ’ s grand-niece , 72-year-old barbara principe of new jersey , told der spiegel newsmagazine .
along with several relatives , principe attended wednesday ’ s opening ceremony at thierse ’ s invitation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barbara principe , right , talks to her lawyer as bundestag president wolfgang thierse , left , speaks with reporters during wednesday 's opening ceremony . the president of the bundestag assured them of his support in finding a solution to the dispute .
“ if compensation claims are justified , they will have to be recognized and enforced appropriately , ” thierse said . compensating wertheim ’ s descendants or legal successors ? even if germany ends up offering more money for the land , it ’ s still unclear whether wertheim ’ s heirs will receive it .
that 's because the family is embroiled in a seperate legal battle with german retailing giant karstadtquelle . karstadt-quelle also claims ownership of the land on which the new library stands : in 1994 , the company took over competitor hertie , which in turn had bought the remaining wertheim assets in 1952 .
the descendants received about € 20,000 . “ karstadt still profits from our family ’ s name and heritage , ” principe said during a news conference on wednesday , adding that karstadt was trying to keep the wertheim descendants from receiving adequate compensation for the property in eastern germany . a karstadt spokesman told dw-world that the company will continue to pursue its claims to the wertheim property . in a separate matter , principe and her relatives have filed a civil law suit against karstadtquelle in the u.s. and are seeking several hundred million dollars in compensation for another property on berlin ’ s swanky potsdamer platz .
a court decision in the case is expected next spring . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : berlin - the resurrected capital dw-world 's series on berlin 's renaissance as a capital city after german reunification .

president bush , sitting next to china 's prime minister wen jiabao in the white house , rebuked the leader of taiwan .
then later , his officials made the strongest commitment yet to intervening in any future conflict in the taiwan strait .
the administration had hoped that prime minister wen 's visit to the us would provide an opportunity to calm down the situation in the taiwan strait .
washington 's asia watchers have been growing anxious over developments there .
the us needs chinese support over the north korea crisis taiwan 's president chen shui-bian has said he will hold a referendum in march .
it will ask the taiwanese people to voice their opposition to china 's military posture - specifically the missiles the people 's liberation army has deployed in fujian province , pointed at taiwan .
china views such a referendum as provocative .
to beijing 's ears , any referendum plan sounds as if president chen is taking taiwan towards an act of self determination and a formal declaration of independence from china .
chinese threats of military force against taiwan are once again in the air .
status quo what mr bush actually said was this : " we oppose any unilateral decision , by either china or taiwan , to change the status quo .
and the comments and actions made by the leader of taiwan indicate that he may be willing to make decisions unilaterally that change the status quo .
and we oppose that . "
prime minister wen reportedly thought this was " terrific " .
publicly , he said : " we very much appreciate the position adopted by president bush towards the latest news and developments in taiwan ; that is , the attempt to resort to referendum of various kinds as excuse to pursue taiwan independence . "
appeasement of a dictatorship simply invites further attempts at intimidation the project for a new american century think tank certainly mr bush 's words reflect american frustration at the taiwanese leader .
american analysts grumble that mr chen seeks to provoke a crisis with china because his poll numbers go up whenever china makes threats .
but in a briefing given later by " a senior administration official " , the administration scrambled to make clear it was not siding with the communist leaders of china against taiwan 's democratically-elected president .
" i want to stress here that the president 's top goal is preserving the peace in the taiwan strait , " said the official .
" we are in no way abandoning support for taiwan 's democracy or for the spread of freedom . "
and he went on to give the strongest warning yet that the united states would intervene in a conflict between china and taiwan .
and it was a warning to china .
" if you try to use force or coercion against the taiwanese , " he said , " we 're going to be there . "
necessary ally but america can not afford another regional crisis .
combat in iraq and afghanistan and the war on terrorism suck up executive energy and bureaucratic resources .
and america especially can not afford a crisis involving china .
the us badly needs chinese support in dousing east asia 's number one flashpoint - north korea and its pursuit of nuclear weapons .
taiwan 's president chen wants a " defensive referendum " yet mr bush finds himself under pressure at home to demonstrate support for taiwan 's young democracy .
this is , after all , an administration that preaches " global democratic revolution " .
a group of commentators at a conservative think tank , the project for a new american century , on hearing president bush 's rebuke to taiwan , immediately fired off an angry editorial by mail .
" the president 's statement today is a mistake , " wrote bill kristol , robert kagan and gary schmitt .
" appeasement of a dictatorship simply invites further attempts at intimidation .
standing with democratic taiwan would secure stability in east asia .
seeming to reward beijing 's bullying will not . "
deliberate ambiguity it is difficult to characterise what took place on tuesday as a shift in american policy .
the americans , since the 1970s , have sought to preserve as if in amber the strange status of taiwan - a functioning state which does not actually ever call itself an independent country - in order to keep china from attacking the island , and thereby wrecking the east asian security balance for a generation .
the us has always described this policy as one of deliberate " ambiguity " : they " do not support " taiwanese independence but they do not " oppose " it , go the policy mantras .
and president bush 's meeting with prime minister wen jiabao does not change that substantially .
but as of tuesday , the americans do " oppose " what they see as chen shui-bian 's politicking with taiwan 's security .
the administration official acknowledged that " we 're seeing developments on both sides of the strait , forcing us to drop some of the ambiguity that has been in the policy in the past " .
the united states is being pulled further into the unpredictable strategic dance between china and taiwan .
president bush and his aides just hope it wo n't be them that have to take sides .

the chartered institute of housing -lrb- cih -rrb- represents about 1,600 officers working in scotland .
the organisation will tell the scottish parliament it fears police and the children 's panels will be overstretched by the burden of the new legislation .
it claims that means the anti-social behaviour bill will leave housing officers as the last line of defence .
the cih has been invited to give verbal evidence to the communities committee , which is looking at the bill .
shirley-anne somerville , cih policy and public affairs officer , said : " our members are concerned that housing is too often being asked to step in to fill a gap left by other resource-pressed services such as the police and social work .

patsy mckie and sheila eccleston travelled to boston , united states , last year , to find out how american methods are curbing street crime .

with 200 people injured and 25 dead in manchester in the last four years , patsy and sheila set up a similar scheme closer to home .
the scheme in greater manchester uses two specially appointed street workers rather than the police to go out into communities .
street worker frederick myers sends out a positive message one of those workers , frederick myers , wants to send out a positive message to young people .
" come and work with us , be in our gang you know what i mean , " he said .
" our gang 's , like , positive and we 're going to show them the way forward so they can reach a good age instead of living ' til they 're 17 , 18 , dodging bullets and things . "
mrs mckie 's son , dorrie , who had never been in trouble with the police , was shot dead in 1999 , but nobody has been charged with his murder .
sheila 's son , dean , was shot and killed almost two years ago in longsight , manchester .
police say his death was gang related but no-one has been charged with his murder .
patsy and sheila hope the mav group will get to the heart of the problem and spare other mothers the heartache they have gone through .

the treasury 's barker review of housing supply says the lack of homes has been a major cause of high uk house prices .
it says homeowners would have saved £ 8bn if house prices had risen at the rates seen in continental europe .
for first time buyers , the report says each is paying an extra £ 32,000 in comparison to the european average .

it estimates that if uk house prices had risen in line with the european average since 1975 , the uk would be £ 8bn better off .
the report said : " constraining supply means that resources which would have been used for housing are instead used for other potentially less beneficial purpose or not used at all . "
in 2001 , around 175,000 new homes were built in the uk , the lowest level since world war ii ; while over the past ten years the number of new dwellings built has been 12.5 % lower than in the previous decade .

according to the review developers in the south east of england are sitting on land which could be used to build up to 40,000 homes in double-quick time as planning permission has already been granted .
however , the review points out that eight out of ten construction firms are facing skill shortages pierre williams spokesman for the house builders federation rebutted claims that developers are sitting on excessive amounts of land .
" in total developers are sitting on a year and a half supply , not much at all .
in the end in our view it all goes back to the planning system , " mr williams said .

but it warns that the uk 's lower rate of house building actually constrains economic growth , thereby " reducing standards of living for everyone in the uk " .
it estimates that if uk house prices had risen in line with the european average since 1975 , the uk would be £ 8bn better off .
the report said : " constraining supply means that resources which would have been used for housing are instead used for other potentially less beneficial purpose or not used at all . "
in 2001 , around 175,000 new homes were built in the uk , the lowest level since world war ii ; while over the past ten years the number of new dwellings built has been 12.5 % lower than in the previous decade .

according to the review developers in the south east of england are sitting on land which could be used to build up to 40,000 homes in double-quick time as planning permission has already been granted .

britain is now so short of new houses that an extra 39,000 need to be built each year just to keep up with the uk 's population growth .
the treasury 's barker review of housing supply says the lack of homes has been a major cause of high uk house prices .
it says homeowners would have saved £ 8bn if house prices had risen at the rates seen in continental europe .
for first time buyers , the report says each is paying an extra £ 32,000 in comparison to the european average .

welsh culture minister alun pugh is due to reveal to the welsh assembly later whether the attraction will receive £ 3m in extra funding .
after a promising start when it opened in 2000 , visitor numbers at the attraction have slumped and it has been kept afloat by emergency handouts .
last week , mr pugh was asked to consider the £ 3m rescue package put forward by trustees at the garden in carmarthenshire . "
to close the garden would be an act of gross cultural vandalism " rhodri glyn thomas am but a panel of five leading international tourism experts set up by the wales tourist board have described the attraction as having no future in its present form .
the findings of a two-day think-tank on the garden were compiled by tourism expert professor terry stevens .
those involved in the report said they were saddened by what they called the garden trustees ' low aspirations .
they said : " the group is concerned that public confidence in the product as an attraction is now at such a nadir it is likely to be irrecoverable with the garden in its current format .
" overall it is the view of the group that the garden has little value and potential as a stand-alone visitor attraction capable of any commercial future .
" in its current format , it is unlikely ever to produce sufficient revenue income to meet its revenue expenditure .
" there will not be a quick fix and the further spending on non-impactful items to try to create an appealing visitor attraction is considered to be unwise . "
criticisms of garden site looks more like a campus than a garden lack of coherence in design great glasshouse is not an asset large scale of the botanic garden is a problem change of name to middleton confused marketplace they added that the proposals by the trustees for " improving the product are unlikely to achieve their objectives and their costs are regarded as underestimates " .
the think-tank concluded that there were several ways ahead for the garden .
scientific research one was as visitor attraction , but only after major investment and ongoing subsidy .
a second option was for it to become a campus for scientific research .
and a third option envisaged the garden becoming a health and well-being destination involving spa treatments and alternative medicine .
in their own 21-point rescue plan outlined last week , trustees at middleton said they needed £ 3m over the next six years to make sure the garden stayed open .
the welsh assembly government had previously ruled out giving them any more money , but mr pugh agreed to consider the plan .
' national treasure ' so far middleton , which is in llanarthne , has managed to survive thanks to emergency handouts from the welsh assembly government , carmarthenshire council and the millennium commission .
but most of the 100 full and part-time staff at the gardens have already been made redundant , and it is feared that the site could close unless mr pugh announces later that more funding will be made available .
rhodri glyn thomas , am for carmarthen east and dinefwr in which the garden is situated , said mr pugh must not allow the attraction to close .
he told bbc radio wales : " there 's nothing new in this report .
" no-one has ever said that there have been no mistakes in the way the garden has been run and marketed , but the fact is , the garden is a national treasure .
" to close the garden would be an act of gross cultural vandalism .
" the way the garden is run and marketed has to change , but there 's tremendous potential at the national botanic garden . "

rhodri glyn thomas , am for carmarthen east and dinefwr in which the garden is situated , said mr pugh must not allow the attraction to close .
he told bbc radio wales : " there 's nothing new in this report .
" no-one has ever said that there have been no mistakes in the way the garden has been run and marketed , but the fact is , the garden is a national treasure .
" to close the garden would be an act of gross cultural vandalism .
" the way the garden is run and marketed has to change , but there 's tremendous potential at the national botanic garden . "

la cercle francais de guernsey , which holds its agm on wednesday evening , fosters the proper use of the pure form of the french language .
the group 's president , jeff mahy , says there are far fewer people speaking french than before the second world war .
mr mahy says before the island 's occupation in 1940 by german forces during the war , many islanders found it easy to use french properly as it is very similar to the norman french spoken in the island .
he says , given guernsey 's close proximity to the french mainland , it is essential the island uses the language correctly .

bbc news online examines the key findings of the report .
what is it ?
in april 's budget , the chancellor announced a review into the causes of inadequate housing supply in the uk .
kate barker , an economist and a member of the bank of england 's monetary policy committee , was appointed to collect views and write a report .
this is only the interim report .
the final report , outlining conclusions and recommendations will be published in at the next budget in 2004 .
this is the second of two reports into the uk housing market .
on tuesday the treasury released a report from professor david miles into the uk mortgage market .
the boom and bust cycle of the housing market has been identified as a major barrier to early uk entry into the single european currency .
in the past the chancellor has implied that bringing the uk housing market into line with its major continental counterparts was key for successfull euro entry .
what 's the problem ?
there are a series of short-term and long-term factors playing their part .
the government wants to stabilise the uk 's runaway housing market , and end its boom and bust housing cycles .
terms of reference the nature and extent of the housing shortage in the uk the consequences of housing market behaviour on price levels how this impacts on market efficiency , land use , distribution of resources , economic growth , productivity and macro-economic stability , affordability and public service delivery causes of unresponsiveness in housing supply : the economics and behaviour of the house building industry , competition , availability of land , access to finance and availability of skills why private housing supply has not expanded to replace the provision of social housing policy constraints including the interaction of the industry with the planning system and tax regime house prices in the uk have doubled since 1995 and many people are now unable to get a foothold onto the housing ladder .
there is also a lack of affordable or social housing , particularly for key workers .
this problem of high house prices is compounded by the shortage of houses being built .
in 2001 house building fell to its lowest level since 1924 excluding the war years and its immediate aftermath .
new housing now accounts for less than 10 % of residential property transactions in england and wales , compared to 40 % in 1965 .
will it get worse ?
the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better .
according to estimates , there are between 220,000 and 230,000 new households being formed annually .
yet , only 165,000 homes were built in 2002 .
key facts a 10 % increase or 2.5m extra homes are needed to push the uk housing stock to the average levels in germany , france and italy growth in the number of households is now outstripping that of new homes built 165,000 new homes were built on 2001 between 220-230,000 new households each year the population is increasing , while the average size of households is declining .
this is caused by a range of demographic factors , such as increasing life expectancy , and more divorces .
all in all , it adds more pressure to housing supply .
who is to blame ?
the report lays much of the blame at door of the uk 's planning authorities .
many who have tried and failed to obtain planning permission in recent years may echo the reports findings that the system is complex and takes an " unacceptably long " time .
all in all , the report calculated that refusals for planning permissions in major housing developments increased from just 15 % in 1996-1999 to 25 % in 2002 .
the report also points out that if house building was to take-off in the uk skills shortages are likely to come into play .
at present more than eight out of ten construction firms report skill shortages - even modest growth would require 70,000 new workers the report concludes .
as a result thousands of badly needed homes are not being built .
however , at this stage the report makes no recommendations as to how the planning process can be quickened up .
publication of the full and final barker report is expected to coincide with the 2004 budget .

the salvation army , which commissioned the poll , is using the figures to call on the government to rethink the legislation which would lead to the creation of las vegas-style " super casinos " .
blackpool wants to transform itself into the uk 's first casino resort , with the council believing it will lead to a transformation in the town 's fortunes .
but the survey said 93 % of people believe there are already enough opportunities to gamble and the law should not be relaxed .
major bill cochrane , from the salvation army , denied towns like blackpool would benefit if they became gambling meccas .
' unseen addiction ' he said : " despite talk of regeneration with resort casinos it seems the only people who will truly benefit from the proposed legislation is the gambling industry , which stands to make substantial profits , and the government through increased tax revenue .
" in many ways gambling is an unseen addiction but where it exists it can cause havoc in people 's lives and tear families apart .
" the theme running through our research is that the government is out of step with the public on many issues raised in the draft gambling bill . "
" if you increase access to addictive activities , whether it be gambling , drugs or drinking , the level of abuse and addiction rises " dr adrian bonner , salvation army mps and lords have visited blackpool to look at the plans , which would see the creation of five hotel casinos along the golden mile .
the proposals are the central plank of the town 's " masterplan " to stem a decline in visitor number .
the survey found several of the specific elements of the proposals are opposed by the public .
children would be allowed to play low value fruit machines but 82 % say under-18s should not be able to gamble on them .
the same number say allowing punters to drink alcohol while gambling will make them lose more money .
ninety four percent warn allowing gambling on credit cards puts more people at risk of running up debts .
more than half - 56 % - do not want a casino on their doorstep - a figure that rises to 64 % among women .
study call dr adrian bonner , the salvation army 's head of addiction services , said : " research has shown time and time again that if you increase access to addictive activities , whether it be gambling , drugs or drinking , the level of abuse and addiction rises .
" we want to see the government commission substantial research on the likely impact of the liberalisation before it is decided upon and enacted . "
the charity commissioned the poll to include in its submission to the government 's consultation process , which ends on wednesday .
it was compiled from as survey of 973 adults between 28 and 30 november .
