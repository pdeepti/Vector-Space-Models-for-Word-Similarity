a new study has discovered that more than a million young children in germany are poor .
with little chance of improving their circumstances , most of them will remain impoverished . a study presented by the national industrial welfare organization arbeiterwohlfahrt -lrb- awo -rrb- this week in berlin paints a bleak picture of the poverty that an estimated one million children in germany grow up in and very often remain plagued by .
the phenomenon is a vicious cycle difficult to break out of , according to the study .
children who come from such impoverished backgrounds often can ’ t keep up with their counterparts in kindergarten and are isolated by the time they enter primary school , it says .
poverty deeply-lodged in german society the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- defines as " poor " those who have access to less than 50 percent of the average income of their country .
by those standards , a poor family of two adults and two children lives off of € 1500 -lrb- $ 1620 -rrb- a month in germany .
the head of the awo , manfred ragati , said this week that the widespread belief that most of these children and their parents must be living from social welfare is often wrong .
" more than 70 percent of these parents can not provide properly for their children despite them holding jobs . "
a representative study done by the awo in 2000 indicated that poverty was widespread in germany .
it concluded that every seventh of the 14 million children in the country were poor and that young children weren ’ t provided financial security despite their parents being employed .
health and adjustment problems in the current poverty study , social scientists observed 185 deprived families up to the time their children reached primary school age .
the findings have revealed a host of problems that arise from being poor .
" poverty has taken strong root ; the health of the affected children has often worsened .
such children , who are usually loners in kindergarten , turn into misfits by the time they reach school .
for instance , they often can ’ t go to the movies or to the swimming pool with their peers and are often visited less frequently at home , because they can ’ t invite other children over , " ragati said .
the study , which estimates that almost 90 percent of poor children suffer from chronic illnesses such as headaches and stomach ailments , shows that familial destitution not only leads to undernourishment and social isolation of children but also drastically limits their future .
children from deprived families don ’ t just face problems at school but often are sent to school at a later age than six , the average age for children to begin primary school in germany .
gerda holz , one of the authors of the study , explained that parents are often unable to cope with bringing up their children because they are too busy trying to earn money to secure their existence .
as a result , the parents have no time to take care of and pay attention to their children 's needs .
holz said this often influences children ’ s behavior .
" we see a visible relation between poverty and behavior that conspicuously stands out , " she said .
holz added that children simply can not cope with too little parental support and attention , the lack of concentration due to chronic illnesses and rejection by fellow students .
the situation , she said , was particularly dramatic with single mothers .
more special care and sensitive laws needed the problem of increasing poverty isn ’ t helped by the fact that children are often considered a financial risk by couples in germany because they lower a family 's living standards .
as a result , the awo is demanding that tax law and state aid programs accommodate the various family models that exist in germany today .
it is also calling for child support and family aid to be dependant on income and for jobs to allow more flexible working hours for single parents .
" we need sufficient child-care options to enable one to harmonize family and job , where child-care doesn ’ t just translate into safe-keeping of children .
in particular , special centers to take care of deprived children need to be increased .

a new study has discovered that more than a million young children in germany are poor .
with little chance of improving their circumstances , most of them will remain impoverished . a study presented by the national industrial welfare organization arbeiterwohlfahrt -lrb- awo -rrb- this week in berlin paints a bleak picture of the poverty that an estimated one million children in germany grow up in and very often remain plagued by .
the phenomenon is a vicious cycle difficult to break out of , according to the study .
children who come from such impoverished backgrounds often can ’ t keep up with their counterparts in kindergarten and are isolated by the time they enter primary school , it says .
poverty deeply-lodged in german society the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- defines as " poor " those who have access to less than 50 percent of the average income of their country .
by those standards , a poor family of two adults and two children lives off of € 1500 -lrb- $ 1620 -rrb- a month in germany .
the head of the awo , manfred ragati , said this week that the widespread belief that most of these children and their parents must be living from social welfare is often wrong .
" more than 70 percent of these parents can not provide properly for their children despite them holding jobs . "
a representative study done by the awo in 2000 indicated that poverty was widespread in germany .
it concluded that every seventh of the 14 million children in the country were poor and that young children weren ’ t provided financial security despite their parents being employed .
health and adjustment problems in the current poverty study , social scientists observed 185 deprived families up to the time their children reached primary school age .
the findings have revealed a host of problems that arise from being poor .
" poverty has taken strong root ; the health of the affected children has often worsened .

a new study has discovered that more than a million young children in germany are poor .
with little chance of improving their circumstances , most of them will remain impoverished . a study presented by the national industrial welfare organization arbeiterwohlfahrt -lrb- awo -rrb- this week in berlin paints a bleak picture of the poverty that an estimated one million children in germany grow up in and very often remain plagued by .
the phenomenon is a vicious cycle difficult to break out of , according to the study .
children who come from such impoverished backgrounds often can ’ t keep up with their counterparts in kindergarten and are isolated by the time they enter primary school , it says .
poverty deeply-lodged in german society the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- defines as " poor " those who have access to less than 50 percent of the average income of their country .
by those standards , a poor family of two adults and two children lives off of € 1500 -lrb- $ 1620 -rrb- a month in germany .
the head of the awo , manfred ragati , said this week that the widespread belief that most of these children and their parents must be living from social welfare is often wrong .
" more than 70 percent of these parents can not provide properly for their children despite them holding jobs . "
a representative study done by the awo in 2000 indicated that poverty was widespread in germany .
it concluded that every seventh of the 14 million children in the country were poor and that young children weren ’ t provided financial security despite their parents being employed .
health and adjustment problems in the current poverty study , social scientists observed 185 deprived families up to the time their children reached primary school age .
the findings have revealed a host of problems that arise from being poor .
" poverty has taken strong root ; the health of the affected children has often worsened .
such children , who are usually loners in kindergarten , turn into misfits by the time they reach school .
for instance , they often can ’ t go to the movies or to the swimming pool with their peers and are often visited less frequently at home , because they can ’ t invite other children over , " ragati said .
the study , which estimates that almost 90 percent of poor children suffer from chronic illnesses such as headaches and stomach ailments , shows that familial destitution not only leads to undernourishment and social isolation of children but also drastically limits their future .
children from deprived families don ’ t just face problems at school but often are sent to school at a later age than six , the average age for children to begin primary school in germany .
gerda holz , one of the authors of the study , explained that parents are often unable to cope with bringing up their children because they are too busy trying to earn money to secure their existence .
as a result , the parents have no time to take care of and pay attention to their children 's needs .
holz said this often influences children ’ s behavior .
" we see a visible relation between poverty and behavior that conspicuously stands out , " she said .
holz added that children simply can not cope with too little parental support and attention , the lack of concentration due to chronic illnesses and rejection by fellow students .
the situation , she said , was particularly dramatic with single mothers .
more special care and sensitive laws needed the problem of increasing poverty isn ’ t helped by the fact that children are often considered a financial risk by couples in germany because they lower a family 's living standards .
as a result , the awo is demanding that tax law and state aid programs accommodate the various family models that exist in germany today .
it is also calling for child support and family aid to be dependant on income and for jobs to allow more flexible working hours for single parents .
" we need sufficient child-care options to enable one to harmonize family and job , where child-care doesn ’ t just translate into safe-keeping of children .
in particular , special centers to take care of deprived children need to be increased .

a new study has discovered that more than a million young children in germany are poor .
with little chance of improving their circumstances , most of them will remain impoverished . a study presented by the national industrial welfare organization arbeiterwohlfahrt -lrb- awo -rrb- this week in berlin paints a bleak picture of the poverty that an estimated one million children in germany grow up in and very often remain plagued by .
the phenomenon is a vicious cycle difficult to break out of , according to the study .
children who come from such impoverished backgrounds often can ’ t keep up with their counterparts in kindergarten and are isolated by the time they enter primary school , it says .
poverty deeply-lodged in german society the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- defines as " poor " those who have access to less than 50 percent of the average income of their country .
by those standards , a poor family of two adults and two children lives off of € 1500 -lrb- $ 1620 -rrb- a month in germany .
the head of the awo , manfred ragati , said this week that the widespread belief that most of these children and their parents must be living from social welfare is often wrong .
" more than 70 percent of these parents can not provide properly for their children despite them holding jobs . "
a representative study done by the awo in 2000 indicated that poverty was widespread in germany .
it concluded that every seventh of the 14 million children in the country were poor and that young children weren ’ t provided financial security despite their parents being employed .
health and adjustment problems in the current poverty study , social scientists observed 185 deprived families up to the time their children reached primary school age .

a new study has discovered that more than a million young children in germany are poor .
with little chance of improving their circumstances , most of them will remain impoverished . a study presented by the national industrial welfare organization arbeiterwohlfahrt -lrb- awo -rrb- this week in berlin paints a bleak picture of the poverty that an estimated one million children in germany grow up in and very often remain plagued by .
the phenomenon is a vicious cycle difficult to break out of , according to the study .
children who come from such impoverished backgrounds often can ’ t keep up with their counterparts in kindergarten and are isolated by the time they enter primary school , it says .
poverty deeply-lodged in german society the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- defines as " poor " those who have access to less than 50 percent of the average income of their country .
by those standards , a poor family of two adults and two children lives off of € 1500 -lrb- $ 1620 -rrb- a month in germany .
the head of the awo , manfred ragati , said this week that the widespread belief that most of these children and their parents must be living from social welfare is often wrong .
" more than 70 percent of these parents can not provide properly for their children despite them holding jobs . "
a representative study done by the awo in 2000 indicated that poverty was widespread in germany .
it concluded that every seventh of the 14 million children in the country were poor and that young children weren ’ t provided financial security despite their parents being employed .
health and adjustment problems in the current poverty study , social scientists observed 185 deprived families up to the time their children reached primary school age .
the findings have revealed a host of problems that arise from being poor .
" poverty has taken strong root ; the health of the affected children has often worsened .
such children , who are usually loners in kindergarten , turn into misfits by the time they reach school .
for instance , they often can ’ t go to the movies or to the swimming pool with their peers and are often visited less frequently at home , because they can ’ t invite other children over , " ragati said .
the study , which estimates that almost 90 percent of poor children suffer from chronic illnesses such as headaches and stomach ailments , shows that familial destitution not only leads to undernourishment and social isolation of children but also drastically limits their future .
children from deprived families don ’ t just face problems at school but often are sent to school at a later age than six , the average age for children to begin primary school in germany .
gerda holz , one of the authors of the study , explained that parents are often unable to cope with bringing up their children because they are too busy trying to earn money to secure their existence .
as a result , the parents have no time to take care of and pay attention to their children 's needs .
holz said this often influences children ’ s behavior .
" we see a visible relation between poverty and behavior that conspicuously stands out , " she said .
holz added that children simply can not cope with too little parental support and attention , the lack of concentration due to chronic illnesses and rejection by fellow students .
the situation , she said , was particularly dramatic with single mothers .
more special care and sensitive laws needed the problem of increasing poverty isn ’ t helped by the fact that children are often considered a financial risk by couples in germany because they lower a family 's living standards .
as a result , the awo is demanding that tax law and state aid programs accommodate the various family models that exist in germany today .
it is also calling for child support and family aid to be dependant on income and for jobs to allow more flexible working hours for single parents .
" we need sufficient child-care options to enable one to harmonize family and job , where child-care doesn ’ t just translate into safe-keeping of children .
in particular , special centers to take care of deprived children need to be increased .

a new study has discovered that more than a million young children in germany are poor .
with little chance of improving their circumstances , most of them will remain impoverished . a study presented by the national industrial welfare organization arbeiterwohlfahrt -lrb- awo -rrb- this week in berlin paints a bleak picture of the poverty that an estimated one million children in germany grow up in and very often remain plagued by .
the phenomenon is a vicious cycle difficult to break out of , according to the study .
children who come from such impoverished backgrounds often can ’ t keep up with their counterparts in kindergarten and are isolated by the time they enter primary school , it says .
poverty deeply-lodged in german society the organization for economic cooperation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- defines as " poor " those who have access to less than 50 percent of the average income of their country .
by those standards , a poor family of two adults and two children lives off of € 1500 -lrb- $ 1620 -rrb- a month in germany .
the head of the awo , manfred ragati , said this week that the widespread belief that most of these children and their parents must be living from social welfare is often wrong .
" more than 70 percent of these parents can not provide properly for their children despite them holding jobs . "
a representative study done by the awo in 2000 indicated that poverty was widespread in germany .
it concluded that every seventh of the 14 million children in the country were poor and that young children weren ’ t provided financial security despite their parents being employed .
health and adjustment problems in the current poverty study , social scientists observed 185 deprived families up to the time their children reached primary school age .
the findings have revealed a host of problems that arise from being poor .
" poverty has taken strong root ; the health of the affected children has often worsened .
such children , who are usually loners in kindergarten , turn into misfits by the time they reach school .
for instance , they often can ’ t go to the movies or to the swimming pool with their peers and are often visited less frequently at home , because they can ’ t invite other children over , " ragati said .

local councils were asked by the department for education to identify ethnic groups as part of the survey .
the aim was to monitor the educational progress of pupils .
but joss trathen , from redruth , was upset when pupils were told they could not describe themselves as cornish .
joss pointed out in his letter - written in cornish - that prince charles , the duke of cornwall , had in the past said there was an important responsibility for preserving the cornish way of looking at life .
have your say do you want an independent cornwall ?
he also quoted prince charles as wanting the cornish language as well as its culture and identity to be safeguarded .
joss said he hoped the prince would help all cornish children to be allowed to be recognised as cornish .
he said : " there was space to put down gypsy or irish traveller , so why not cornish ? "
his father andy , said : " the education authority in one london borough had more than 85 ethnic categories on their form .
" but cornwall chose not to include cornish .
