saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way . scotland enjoyed their best result under german coach berti vogts as kenny miller 's second-half equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw with world cup finalists germany in saturday 's euro 2004 qualifier .
fredi bobic gave the visitors the lead after 23 minutes but scotland - managed by the man who led germany to their third european championship success in 1996 - never let their heads drop and miller 's equaliser 20 minutes from time ensured them a merited point .
the result leaves group five still impossible to call .
germany , who visit the faroe islands on wednesday , lead the way with eight points from four games .
scotland also have eight but from five games , while lithuania , who host iceland on wednesday , have seven from five .
passionate display the pressure should also ease on vogts after the memory of some depressing defeats were swept away by a passionate display that handed scotland their most impressive result in years .
they took the initiative from the start , not allowing the visitors to settle as they snapped into the tackle .
germany looked tired and short of ideas .
their last three competitive results have been a a 2-1 home win over the faroes , a 1-1 home draw with lithuania and now this draw at hampden .
scotland , while lacking the necessary penetration , looked likelier to find an opener but were undone by poor marking when torsten frings was given far too much room wide on the right and bobic rose unmarked and to send a powerful header into the ground and over keeper robert douglas . it was a poor goal to concede and perhaps underlined why scotland slipped to a lowly 64th in the fifa standings earlier this week .
they should have found the equaliser four minutes into the second half when cameron miskicked in front of goal after oliver kahn had blocked a fierce steve crawford shot . made amends cameron made amends in the 69th minute , however .
christian woerns handled and cameron 's quickly-taken free kick saw his wolverhampton wanderers team mate miller scamper clear and plant the ball low beyond kahn .
the goal shook germany into action and they could have clinched the win after missing a succession of chances in the closing moments as bobic fired wide while douglas was at full stretch to turn away a schneider free kick .
but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .
" it was a great performance from my team and for scottish football , " said vogts , who has been widely criticised after a series of poor showings in friendlies .
" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .
germany coach rudi voeller said .
" we can not be satisfied with this . " we did n't move well and gave away the ball far too often .
we could n't stamp our authority on the game , especially in midfield .
" in the last 20 minutes the players seemed to realise at last that a draw was not enough .
scotland were getting tired and we had a few chances , but i think a german victory would not have been fair .
two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands on wednesday . "
bobic said his team they did not play their own game .
" only after the equaliser did we start to play football , " said the goalscorer .
" before that we were just fighting .
we should have used our playing skills because that 's what makes the difference between us and scotland but we could n't do that .

but a pro-euro push for the coming years is already in the works . when he addressed the house of commons on monday afternoon , no one was surprised by what britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown had to say .
his announcement on whether or not great britain is ready to adopt europe ’ s common currency was an open secret .
newspapers across the country had already leaked the brown opinion that economic conditions are not yet right for britain to drop the pound for the euro .
in a formal presentation to parliament , brown outlined his arguments for holding back on joining the 12-member euro zone .
he said that three of the five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of adopting the common currency had not been met .
there was not yet sufficient convergence between the economies of britain and the euro zone or sufficient flexibility , brown stated .
the five tests evaluated the impact the euro would have on the british economy , financial services , jobs , housing and investment .
the decision was based on the " most rigorous and comprehensive assessment that the treasury has ever done on an economic issue , " brown told the press on sunday .
" right at the center of it -lsb- the decision -rsb- is what is the national economic interest for the future and that is why the five tests are so important , " he told bbc television monday morning before addressing parliament .
" in principle , i want to join the single currency – in practical terms , we have got to be sure that all the conditions are in the right place . "
membership in the near future ?
while ruling out immediate euro zone membership , brown ’ s statements marked the start of a major government push to reverse widespread public opposition to the euro .
" our view that membership in a successful single currency would be of benefit to the british people as well as to europe is strengthened by the results of our assessment , " brown told the house of commons on monday .
on tuesday , prime minister tony blair will hold a rare joint press conference with chancellor brown to launch a campaign to sell the benefits of the common currency to a nation hesitant to give up its economic autonomy .
but convincing the traditional euro-skeptical country of this will be difficult .
recent polls conducted at the beginning of june showed that 60 percent of the country opposed scrapping the pound , which they ’ ve had since the eighth century .
only 33 percent were in favor of the euro ; the rest were undecided .
many in business and industry who initially were in favor of introducing the euro back in 1997 are now less certain .
they are watching the developments in the rest of europe very closely and biding their time until conditions are just right .
adair turner , former head of the confederation of british industry and now vice president of merril lynch , told deutsche welle that many business leaders are in the " let ’ s wait and see camp or in the i don ’ t know , i still want to consider it camp . "
" the number of people who are totally against the euro for all time has always been small .
most people who are in that camp are arguing on the basis of politics and not economics , " said turner .
politics vs. economics for many political pundits , the overriding opposition to the euro is the real reason behind brown ’ s opting to hold back .
if it recommends joining the currency union , the british government will have to hold a referendum on euro membership .
the vote will likely be a no , a result blair ’ s liberal party can not afford at this time .
" the fact is that tony blair has been forced to make the right decision for the wrong reason , " said the strongly anti-euro sun newspaper in its editorial on monday .
opposition party leaders have also criticized blair and brown ’ s decision to forego membership for the time being .
conservative party leader , iain duncan smith dismissed the economic arguments on bbc television : " the british people don ’ t want to enter , they know this is a political decision , and they know that the economic circumstances are peripheral to that decision . "
" all they -lsb- blair and brown -rsb- are really trying to do is find a moment when they can win the referendum , " smith said .
brown is said to be in favor of holding the referendum before the next general election , which has to be held by mid-2006 at the latest .

saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way . scotland enjoyed their best result under german coach berti vogts as kenny miller 's second-half equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw with world cup finalists germany in saturday 's euro 2004 qualifier .
fredi bobic gave the visitors the lead after 23 minutes but scotland - managed by the man who led germany to their third european championship success in 1996 - never let their heads drop and miller 's equaliser 20 minutes from time ensured them a merited point .
the result leaves group five still impossible to call .
germany , who visit the faroe islands on wednesday , lead the way with eight points from four games .
scotland also have eight but from five games , while lithuania , who host iceland on wednesday , have seven from five .
passionate display the pressure should also ease on vogts after the memory of some depressing defeats were swept away by a passionate display that handed scotland their most impressive result in years .
they took the initiative from the start , not allowing the visitors to settle as they snapped into the tackle .
germany looked tired and short of ideas .
their last three competitive results have been a a 2-1 home win over the faroes , a 1-1 home draw with lithuania and now this draw at hampden .
scotland , while lacking the necessary penetration , looked likelier to find an opener but were undone by poor marking when torsten frings was given far too much room wide on the right and bobic rose unmarked and to send a powerful header into the ground and over keeper robert douglas . it was a poor goal to concede and perhaps underlined why scotland slipped to a lowly 64th in the fifa standings earlier this week .
they should have found the equaliser four minutes into the second half when cameron miskicked in front of goal after oliver kahn had blocked a fierce steve crawford shot . made amends cameron made amends in the 69th minute , however .
christian woerns handled and cameron 's quickly-taken free kick saw his wolverhampton wanderers team mate miller scamper clear and plant the ball low beyond kahn .
the goal shook germany into action and they could have clinched the win after missing a succession of chances in the closing moments as bobic fired wide while douglas was at full stretch to turn away a schneider free kick .
but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .
" it was a great performance from my team and for scottish football , " said vogts , who has been widely criticised after a series of poor showings in friendlies .
" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .
germany coach rudi voeller said .
" we can not be satisfied with this . " we did n't move well and gave away the ball far too often .
we could n't stamp our authority on the game , especially in midfield .
" in the last 20 minutes the players seemed to realise at last that a draw was not enough .
scotland were getting tired and we had a few chances , but i think a german victory would not have been fair .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 09.06.2003 britain says no to euro for now großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british have been against adopting the euro since its introduction on the continent in 2002 britain ’ s government announced on monday that the time is not yet right to switch from the pound to the euro .
but a pro-euro push for the coming years is already in the works . when he addressed the house of commons on monday afternoon , no one was surprised by what britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown had to say .
his announcement on whether or not great britain is ready to adopt europe ’ s common currency was an open secret .
newspapers across the country had already leaked the brown opinion that economic conditions are not yet right for britain to drop the pound for the euro .
in a formal presentation to parliament , brown outlined his arguments for holding back on joining the 12-member euro zone .
he said that three of the five self-imposed economic tests on the benefits of adopting the common currency had not been met .
there was not yet sufficient convergence between the economies of britain and the euro zone or sufficient flexibility , brown stated .
the five tests evaluated the impact the euro would have on the british economy , financial services , jobs , housing and investment .
the decision was based on the " most rigorous and comprehensive assessment that the treasury has ever done on an economic issue , " brown told the press on sunday .
" right at the center of it -lsb- the decision -rsb- is what is the national economic interest for the future and that is why the five tests are so important , " he told bbc television monday morning before addressing parliament .
" in principle , i want to join the single currency – in practical terms , we have got to be sure that all the conditions are in the right place . "
membership in the near future ?
while ruling out immediate euro zone membership , brown ’ s statements marked the start of a major government push to reverse widespread public opposition to the euro .
" our view that membership in a successful single currency would be of benefit to the british people as well as to europe is strengthened by the results of our assessment , " brown told the house of commons on monday .
on tuesday , prime minister tony blair will hold a rare joint press conference with chancellor brown to launch a campaign to sell the benefits of the common currency to a nation hesitant to give up its economic autonomy .
but convincing the traditional euro-skeptical country of this will be difficult .
recent polls conducted at the beginning of june showed that 60 percent of the country opposed scrapping the pound , which they ’ ve had since the eighth century .
only 33 percent were in favor of the euro ; the rest were undecided .
many in business and industry who initially were in favor of introducing the euro back in 1997 are now less certain .
they are watching the developments in the rest of europe very closely and biding their time until conditions are just right .
adair turner , former head of the confederation of british industry and now vice president of merril lynch , told deutsche welle that many business leaders are in the " let ’ s wait and see camp or in the i don ’ t know , i still want to consider it camp . "
" the number of people who are totally against the euro for all time has always been small .
most people who are in that camp are arguing on the basis of politics and not economics , " said turner .
politics vs. economics for many political pundits , the overriding opposition to the euro is the real reason behind brown ’ s opting to hold back .
if it recommends joining the currency union , the british government will have to hold a referendum on euro membership .
the vote will likely be a no , a result blair ’ s liberal party can not afford at this time .
" the fact is that tony blair has been forced to make the right decision for the wrong reason , " said the strongly anti-euro sun newspaper in its editorial on monday .
opposition party leaders have also criticized blair and brown ’ s decision to forego membership for the time being .
conservative party leader , iain duncan smith dismissed the economic arguments on bbc television : " the british people don ’ t want to enter , they know this is a political decision , and they know that the economic circumstances are peripheral to that decision . "
" all they -lsb- blair and brown -rsb- are really trying to do is find a moment when they can win the referendum , " smith said .
brown is said to be in favor of holding the referendum before the next general election , which has to be held by mid-2006 at the latest .
during his speech before parliament , he announced that a draft bill paving the way for the vote on the euro would be published in the fall . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de business in britain cools on euro with the euro zone 's current poor economic performance and germany 's breach of the 3 percent budget deficit , ecomomists in britain are becoming increasingly cautious about joining the monetary union -lrb- nov .

but a world-class culture , shopping and nightlife beckon beyond the beer . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
it 's where tourists can don a pair of lederhosen , gulp one-liter mugs of beer , munch sausages galore , listen to the distinct , thick dialect of the bavarians and dance to the beat of umpah-music - all in the shadow of the alps .
ahhh , the typical german image . but quaint , village-like munich - it 's often called the " village of one million " - also has another side .
as one of the wealthiest cities in germany , munich has an affluent community , drawn from film , television , media and the good old-fashioned aristocracy , that likes to strut its stuff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's city hall and marienkirche the rich and famous even have a name , the " shickeria . "
they add a glossy edge to the city , bringing with them stylish stomping grounds including new bars , restaurants , and trendy boutiques . however , there is one thing that unites everyone in munich , the tourists and glitterati alike : the beer .
beer is one of the main reasons why millions flock to the capital of bavaria every year .
beer is what makes the world 's largest public festival , oktoberfest , so popular and has spawned countless beer gardens throughout the city , devoted to the consumption of this most-favored beverage . beware of rubber-necking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoyment for all the senses at oktoberfest munich is divided by the isar river , with most of the city 's treasures on the left bank .
many of the architectural jewels are concentrated around the marienplatz in the middle of the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- . without having to do much navigating you ca n't help but stumble by the 19th century neo-gothic neues rathaus -lrb- new city hall -rrb- .
fantastic photo opportunities await when the glockenspiel in the center of the rathaus strikes the hour .
copper figures emerge from the clock , dancing to the music of 43 bells .
-lrb- beware of tourist rubber-necking below this most iconic of munich experiences ! -rrb- steps away , there 's a great view from the spire of the gothic st. peter 's church - sometimes even as far as the alps .
and for lavish interiors , the elaborate 18th century rococo ceiling inside the heiliggeistkirche -lrb- church of the holy spirit -rrb- is a must . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english garden the other dominant and extremely popular building in the altstadt , not far from marienplatz , is the frauenkirche -lrb- church of our lady -rrb- , a gothic assembly hall and the final resting place of ludwig the bavarian .
the twin copper domes are one of the defining images of the münich skyline . shop and surf -lrb- and we do n't mean online -rrb- in between all these historical monuments is a great shopping district with a thriving café scene .
power shoppers head straight to maximilianstrasse , where gucci and all the heavy-hitters line the street . when locals are n't sipping coffee at the marienplatz , they are sunning themselves in europe 's largest , and perhaps most famous city park , the englischer garten . there 's a small lake and part of the isar river flows through the park , making it a good place to go boating , swimming and even surfing .
-lrb- yes , real surfing : swells in a portion of the isar river known as eisbach create great surfing conditions - well , at least good enough for alp-locked beach bum wannabes . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese tower the many paths winding through the park are popular with joggers and rollerbladers , and the beer garden at the chinesischer turm -lrb- chinese tower -rrb- , is the gathering place in the summer . south of the altstadt are the adjoining gärtner and glockenbach quarters , both of which have benefited from the city 's rising hipster population .
around gärtnerplatz , and just to the west in glockenbach , independent designers and up-and-coming restauranteurs have set up shop . further east across the river , another neighborhood , haidhausen , is garnering a bit of attention .

but a world-class culture , shopping and nightlife beckon beyond the beer . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
it 's where tourists can don a pair of lederhosen , gulp one-liter mugs of beer , munch sausages galore , listen to the distinct , thick dialect of the bavarians and dance to the beat of umpah-music - all in the shadow of the alps .
ahhh , the typical german image . but quaint , village-like munich - it 's often called the " village of one million " - also has another side .
as one of the wealthiest cities in germany , munich has an affluent community , drawn from film , television , media and the good old-fashioned aristocracy , that likes to strut its stuff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's city hall and marienkirche the rich and famous even have a name , the " shickeria . "
they add a glossy edge to the city , bringing with them stylish stomping grounds including new bars , restaurants , and trendy boutiques . however , there is one thing that unites everyone in munich , the tourists and glitterati alike : the beer .
beer is one of the main reasons why millions flock to the capital of bavaria every year .
beer is what makes the world 's largest public festival , oktoberfest , so popular and has spawned countless beer gardens throughout the city , devoted to the consumption of this most-favored beverage . beware of rubber-necking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoyment for all the senses at oktoberfest munich is divided by the isar river , with most of the city 's treasures on the left bank .
many of the architectural jewels are concentrated around the marienplatz in the middle of the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- . without having to do much navigating you ca n't help but stumble by the 19th century neo-gothic neues rathaus -lrb- new city hall -rrb- .
fantastic photo opportunities await when the glockenspiel in the center of the rathaus strikes the hour .
copper figures emerge from the clock , dancing to the music of 43 bells .
-lrb- beware of tourist rubber-necking below this most iconic of munich experiences ! -rrb- steps away , there 's a great view from the spire of the gothic st. peter 's church - sometimes even as far as the alps .
and for lavish interiors , the elaborate 18th century rococo ceiling inside the heiliggeistkirche -lrb- church of the holy spirit -rrb- is a must . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english garden the other dominant and extremely popular building in the altstadt , not far from marienplatz , is the frauenkirche -lrb- church of our lady -rrb- , a gothic assembly hall and the final resting place of ludwig the bavarian .
the twin copper domes are one of the defining images of the münich skyline . shop and surf -lrb- and we do n't mean online -rrb- in between all these historical monuments is a great shopping district with a thriving café scene .
power shoppers head straight to maximilianstrasse , where gucci and all the heavy-hitters line the street . when locals are n't sipping coffee at the marienplatz , they are sunning themselves in europe 's largest , and perhaps most famous city park , the englischer garten . there 's a small lake and part of the isar river flows through the park , making it a good place to go boating , swimming and even surfing .
-lrb- yes , real surfing : swells in a portion of the isar river known as eisbach create great surfing conditions - well , at least good enough for alp-locked beach bum wannabes . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese tower the many paths winding through the park are popular with joggers and rollerbladers , and the beer garden at the chinesischer turm -lrb- chinese tower -rrb- , is the gathering place in the summer . south of the altstadt are the adjoining gärtner and glockenbach quarters , both of which have benefited from the city 's rising hipster population .
around gärtnerplatz , and just to the west in glockenbach , independent designers and up-and-coming restauranteurs have set up shop . further east across the river , another neighborhood , haidhausen , is garnering a bit of attention .
around weissenburger platz and rosenheimer platz , new restaurants and shops open monthly . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readers share german adventures planning a trip to germany this year ?

saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way . scotland enjoyed their best result under german coach berti vogts as kenny miller 's second-half equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw with world cup finalists germany in saturday 's euro 2004 qualifier .
fredi bobic gave the visitors the lead after 23 minutes but scotland - managed by the man who led germany to their third european championship success in 1996 - never let their heads drop and miller 's equaliser 20 minutes from time ensured them a merited point .
the result leaves group five still impossible to call .
germany , who visit the faroe islands on wednesday , lead the way with eight points from four games .
scotland also have eight but from five games , while lithuania , who host iceland on wednesday , have seven from five .
passionate display the pressure should also ease on vogts after the memory of some depressing defeats were swept away by a passionate display that handed scotland their most impressive result in years .
they took the initiative from the start , not allowing the visitors to settle as they snapped into the tackle .
germany looked tired and short of ideas .
their last three competitive results have been a a 2-1 home win over the faroes , a 1-1 home draw with lithuania and now this draw at hampden .
scotland , while lacking the necessary penetration , looked likelier to find an opener but were undone by poor marking when torsten frings was given far too much room wide on the right and bobic rose unmarked and to send a powerful header into the ground and over keeper robert douglas . it was a poor goal to concede and perhaps underlined why scotland slipped to a lowly 64th in the fifa standings earlier this week .
they should have found the equaliser four minutes into the second half when cameron miskicked in front of goal after oliver kahn had blocked a fierce steve crawford shot . made amends cameron made amends in the 69th minute , however .
christian woerns handled and cameron 's quickly-taken free kick saw his wolverhampton wanderers team mate miller scamper clear and plant the ball low beyond kahn .
the goal shook germany into action and they could have clinched the win after missing a succession of chances in the closing moments as bobic fired wide while douglas was at full stretch to turn away a schneider free kick .
but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .
" it was a great performance from my team and for scottish football , " said vogts , who has been widely criticised after a series of poor showings in friendlies .
" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .
germany coach rudi voeller said .
" we can not be satisfied with this . " we did n't move well and gave away the ball far too often .
we could n't stamp our authority on the game , especially in midfield .
" in the last 20 minutes the players seemed to realise at last that a draw was not enough .
scotland were getting tired and we had a few chances , but i think a german victory would not have been fair .
two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands on wednesday . "
bobic said his team they did not play their own game .
" only after the equaliser did we start to play football , " said the goalscorer .
" before that we were just fighting .
we should have used our playing skills because that 's what makes the difference between us and scotland but we could n't do that .

scotland , while lacking the necessary penetration , looked likelier to find an opener but were undone by poor marking when torsten frings was given far too much room wide on the right and bobic rose unmarked and to send a powerful header into the ground and over keeper robert douglas . it was a poor goal to concede and perhaps underlined why scotland slipped to a lowly 64th in the fifa standings earlier this week .
they should have found the equaliser four minutes into the second half when cameron miskicked in front of goal after oliver kahn had blocked a fierce steve crawford shot . made amends cameron made amends in the 69th minute , however .
christian woerns handled and cameron 's quickly-taken free kick saw his wolverhampton wanderers team mate miller scamper clear and plant the ball low beyond kahn .
the goal shook germany into action and they could have clinched the win after missing a succession of chances in the closing moments as bobic fired wide while douglas was at full stretch to turn away a schneider free kick .
but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .
" it was a great performance from my team and for scottish football , " said vogts , who has been widely criticised after a series of poor showings in friendlies .
" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .
germany coach rudi voeller said .
" we can not be satisfied with this . " we did n't move well and gave away the ball far too often .
we could n't stamp our authority on the game , especially in midfield .
" in the last 20 minutes the players seemed to realise at last that a draw was not enough .
scotland were getting tired and we had a few chances , but i think a german victory would not have been fair .
two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands on wednesday . "
bobic said his team they did not play their own game .
" only after the equaliser did we start to play football , " said the goalscorer .
" before that we were just fighting .
we should have used our playing skills because that 's what makes the difference between us and scotland but we could n't do that .

saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way . scotland enjoyed their best result under german coach berti vogts as kenny miller 's second-half equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw with world cup finalists germany in saturday 's euro 2004 qualifier .
fredi bobic gave the visitors the lead after 23 minutes but scotland - managed by the man who led germany to their third european championship success in 1996 - never let their heads drop and miller 's equaliser 20 minutes from time ensured them a merited point .
the result leaves group five still impossible to call .
germany , who visit the faroe islands on wednesday , lead the way with eight points from four games .
scotland also have eight but from five games , while lithuania , who host iceland on wednesday , have seven from five .
passionate display the pressure should also ease on vogts after the memory of some depressing defeats were swept away by a passionate display that handed scotland their most impressive result in years .
they took the initiative from the start , not allowing the visitors to settle as they snapped into the tackle .
germany looked tired and short of ideas .

poland 's voters gave 77 percent of their " yes " votes to the referendum in joining the eu .
only 23 percent voted " no " with a voter turnout of 58 percent .
" the biggest winner is poland , " said an ebullient lezek miller , the country 's prime minister .
" i am so very happy . "
the vote clears the way to accession for poland , the largest of 10 new countries to join the 15-member european union .
observers say it is one more in a string of victories for the former communist country . in the lead-up to the iraq war , poland profiled itself by supporting the u.s.-led invasion and was promptly awarded a prestigious assignment in guarding postwar iraq and a visit by president george w. bush .
in the union , poland is expected to quickly make its presence felt , with a population of 38 million dwarfing all but five current members of the eu .
european leaders , including poland 's neighbor germany , greeted the results warmly .
" there was never any doubt about poland belonging to europe , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement .
" with their clear vote in favor of the eu the people of poland have taken advantage of this historic chance . "
catholic church , farmers had doubts but there were doubts about whether poles wanted to join the european union .
the country 's farmers , a significant political lobby , were angered that current eu members like france and germany would get double as much in eu farm subsidies .
the polish catholic church was wary the eu would interfere with the country 's anti-abortion stance .
through hard negotiation by the polish government during accession talks in copenhagen in december , and the pro-eu blessings of the pope , the naysayers began to lose footing . a poll last week of polish farmers indicated that 52 percent would vote in favor of the eu during the two-day referendum .
to remove any possible doubts , the government recruited soccer stars and beauty queens in a pro-eu campaign that bombarded airwaves and newsprint leading up to the vote .
their decision to hold the referendum over two days helped as well , with enough people coming the second day to push the country over the 50 percent voter turnout required .
poland is the sixth country of the new 10 to hold a referendum .
the czech republic will hold a referendum next weekend , estonia and latvia will follow in the fall . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder visits poland ahead of eu vote germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .

poland 's voters gave 77 percent of their " yes " votes to the referendum in joining the eu .
only 23 percent voted " no " with a voter turnout of 58 percent .
" the biggest winner is poland , " said an ebullient lezek miller , the country 's prime minister .
" i am so very happy . "
the vote clears the way to accession for poland , the largest of 10 new countries to join the 15-member european union .
observers say it is one more in a string of victories for the former communist country . in the lead-up to the iraq war , poland profiled itself by supporting the u.s.-led invasion and was promptly awarded a prestigious assignment in guarding postwar iraq and a visit by president george w. bush .
in the union , poland is expected to quickly make its presence felt , with a population of 38 million dwarfing all but five current members of the eu .
european leaders , including poland 's neighbor germany , greeted the results warmly .
" there was never any doubt about poland belonging to europe , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement .
" with their clear vote in favor of the eu the people of poland have taken advantage of this historic chance . "
catholic church , farmers had doubts but there were doubts about whether poles wanted to join the european union .
the country 's farmers , a significant political lobby , were angered that current eu members like france and germany would get double as much in eu farm subsidies .
the polish catholic church was wary the eu would interfere with the country 's anti-abortion stance .
through hard negotiation by the polish government during accession talks in copenhagen in december , and the pro-eu blessings of the pope , the naysayers began to lose footing . a poll last week of polish farmers indicated that 52 percent would vote in favor of the eu during the two-day referendum .
to remove any possible doubts , the government recruited soccer stars and beauty queens in a pro-eu campaign that bombarded airwaves and newsprint leading up to the vote .
their decision to hold the referendum over two days helped as well , with enough people coming the second day to push the country over the 50 percent voter turnout required .

saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way . scotland enjoyed their best result under german coach berti vogts as kenny miller 's second-half equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw with world cup finalists germany in saturday 's euro 2004 qualifier .
fredi bobic gave the visitors the lead after 23 minutes but scotland - managed by the man who led germany to their third european championship success in 1996 - never let their heads drop and miller 's equaliser 20 minutes from time ensured them a merited point .
the result leaves group five still impossible to call .
germany , who visit the faroe islands on wednesday , lead the way with eight points from four games .
scotland also have eight but from five games , while lithuania , who host iceland on wednesday , have seven from five .
passionate display the pressure should also ease on vogts after the memory of some depressing defeats were swept away by a passionate display that handed scotland their most impressive result in years .
they took the initiative from the start , not allowing the visitors to settle as they snapped into the tackle .
germany looked tired and short of ideas .
their last three competitive results have been a a 2-1 home win over the faroes , a 1-1 home draw with lithuania and now this draw at hampden .
scotland , while lacking the necessary penetration , looked likelier to find an opener but were undone by poor marking when torsten frings was given far too much room wide on the right and bobic rose unmarked and to send a powerful header into the ground and over keeper robert douglas . it was a poor goal to concede and perhaps underlined why scotland slipped to a lowly 64th in the fifa standings earlier this week .
they should have found the equaliser four minutes into the second half when cameron miskicked in front of goal after oliver kahn had blocked a fierce steve crawford shot . made amends cameron made amends in the 69th minute , however .
christian woerns handled and cameron 's quickly-taken free kick saw his wolverhampton wanderers team mate miller scamper clear and plant the ball low beyond kahn .
the goal shook germany into action and they could have clinched the win after missing a succession of chances in the closing moments as bobic fired wide while douglas was at full stretch to turn away a schneider free kick .
but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .
" it was a great performance from my team and for scottish football , " said vogts , who has been widely criticised after a series of poor showings in friendlies .
" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .
germany coach rudi voeller said .
" we can not be satisfied with this . " we did n't move well and gave away the ball far too often .
we could n't stamp our authority on the game , especially in midfield .
" in the last 20 minutes the players seemed to realise at last that a draw was not enough .
scotland were getting tired and we had a few chances , but i think a german victory would not have been fair .
two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands on wednesday . "
bobic said his team they did not play their own game .
" only after the equaliser did we start to play football , " said the goalscorer .
" before that we were just fighting .
we should have used our playing skills because that 's what makes the difference between us and scotland but we could n't do that .

but a world-class culture , shopping and nightlife beckon beyond the beer . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
it 's where tourists can don a pair of lederhosen , gulp one-liter mugs of beer , munch sausages galore , listen to the distinct , thick dialect of the bavarians and dance to the beat of umpah-music - all in the shadow of the alps .
ahhh , the typical german image . but quaint , village-like munich - it 's often called the " village of one million " - also has another side .
as one of the wealthiest cities in germany , munich has an affluent community , drawn from film , television , media and the good old-fashioned aristocracy , that likes to strut its stuff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's city hall and marienkirche the rich and famous even have a name , the " shickeria . "
they add a glossy edge to the city , bringing with them stylish stomping grounds including new bars , restaurants , and trendy boutiques . however , there is one thing that unites everyone in munich , the tourists and glitterati alike : the beer .
beer is one of the main reasons why millions flock to the capital of bavaria every year .
beer is what makes the world 's largest public festival , oktoberfest , so popular and has spawned countless beer gardens throughout the city , devoted to the consumption of this most-favored beverage . beware of rubber-necking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoyment for all the senses at oktoberfest munich is divided by the isar river , with most of the city 's treasures on the left bank .
many of the architectural jewels are concentrated around the marienplatz in the middle of the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- . without having to do much navigating you ca n't help but stumble by the 19th century neo-gothic neues rathaus -lrb- new city hall -rrb- .
fantastic photo opportunities await when the glockenspiel in the center of the rathaus strikes the hour .
copper figures emerge from the clock , dancing to the music of 43 bells .
-lrb- beware of tourist rubber-necking below this most iconic of munich experiences ! -rrb- steps away , there 's a great view from the spire of the gothic st. peter 's church - sometimes even as far as the alps .
and for lavish interiors , the elaborate 18th century rococo ceiling inside the heiliggeistkirche -lrb- church of the holy spirit -rrb- is a must . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english garden the other dominant and extremely popular building in the altstadt , not far from marienplatz , is the frauenkirche -lrb- church of our lady -rrb- , a gothic assembly hall and the final resting place of ludwig the bavarian .
the twin copper domes are one of the defining images of the münich skyline . shop and surf -lrb- and we do n't mean online -rrb- in between all these historical monuments is a great shopping district with a thriving café scene .
power shoppers head straight to maximilianstrasse , where gucci and all the heavy-hitters line the street . when locals are n't sipping coffee at the marienplatz , they are sunning themselves in europe 's largest , and perhaps most famous city park , the englischer garten . there 's a small lake and part of the isar river flows through the park , making it a good place to go boating , swimming and even surfing .
-lrb- yes , real surfing : swells in a portion of the isar river known as eisbach create great surfing conditions - well , at least good enough for alp-locked beach bum wannabes . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese tower the many paths winding through the park are popular with joggers and rollerbladers , and the beer garden at the chinesischer turm -lrb- chinese tower -rrb- , is the gathering place in the summer . south of the altstadt are the adjoining gärtner and glockenbach quarters , both of which have benefited from the city 's rising hipster population .
around gärtnerplatz , and just to the west in glockenbach , independent designers and up-and-coming restauranteurs have set up shop . further east across the river , another neighborhood , haidhausen , is garnering a bit of attention .
around weissenburger platz and rosenheimer platz , new restaurants and shops open monthly . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readers share german adventures planning a trip to germany this year ?

saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way . scotland enjoyed their best result under german coach berti vogts as kenny miller 's second-half equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw with world cup finalists germany in saturday 's euro 2004 qualifier .
fredi bobic gave the visitors the lead after 23 minutes but scotland - managed by the man who led germany to their third european championship success in 1996 - never let their heads drop and miller 's equaliser 20 minutes from time ensured them a merited point .
the result leaves group five still impossible to call .
germany , who visit the faroe islands on wednesday , lead the way with eight points from four games .
scotland also have eight but from five games , while lithuania , who host iceland on wednesday , have seven from five .
passionate display the pressure should also ease on vogts after the memory of some depressing defeats were swept away by a passionate display that handed scotland their most impressive result in years .
they took the initiative from the start , not allowing the visitors to settle as they snapped into the tackle .
germany looked tired and short of ideas .
their last three competitive results have been a a 2-1 home win over the faroes , a 1-1 home draw with lithuania and now this draw at hampden .
scotland , while lacking the necessary penetration , looked likelier to find an opener but were undone by poor marking when torsten frings was given far too much room wide on the right and bobic rose unmarked and to send a powerful header into the ground and over keeper robert douglas . it was a poor goal to concede and perhaps underlined why scotland slipped to a lowly 64th in the fifa standings earlier this week .
they should have found the equaliser four minutes into the second half when cameron miskicked in front of goal after oliver kahn had blocked a fierce steve crawford shot . made amends cameron made amends in the 69th minute , however .
christian woerns handled and cameron 's quickly-taken free kick saw his wolverhampton wanderers team mate miller scamper clear and plant the ball low beyond kahn .
the goal shook germany into action and they could have clinched the win after missing a succession of chances in the closing moments as bobic fired wide while douglas was at full stretch to turn away a schneider free kick .
but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .
" it was a great performance from my team and for scottish football , " said vogts , who has been widely criticised after a series of poor showings in friendlies .
" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .
germany coach rudi voeller said .
" we can not be satisfied with this . " we did n't move well and gave away the ball far too often .
we could n't stamp our authority on the game , especially in midfield .
" in the last 20 minutes the players seemed to realise at last that a draw was not enough .
scotland were getting tired and we had a few chances , but i think a german victory would not have been fair .
two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands on wednesday . "
bobic said his team they did not play their own game .
" only after the equaliser did we start to play football , " said the goalscorer .
" before that we were just fighting .
we should have used our playing skills because that 's what makes the difference between us and scotland but we could n't do that .

but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .
" it was a great performance from my team and for scottish football , " said vogts , who has been widely criticised after a series of poor showings in friendlies .
" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .
germany coach rudi voeller said .
" we can not be satisfied with this . " we did n't move well and gave away the ball far too often .
we could n't stamp our authority on the game , especially in midfield .
" in the last 20 minutes the players seemed to realise at last that a draw was not enough .
scotland were getting tired and we had a few chances , but i think a german victory would not have been fair .
two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands on wednesday . "
bobic said his team they did not play their own game .
" only after the equaliser did we start to play football , " said the goalscorer .
" before that we were just fighting .
we should have used our playing skills because that 's what makes the difference between us and scotland but we could n't do that .

poland 's voters gave 77 percent of their " yes " votes to the referendum in joining the eu .
only 23 percent voted " no " with a voter turnout of 58 percent .

saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way . scotland enjoyed their best result under german coach berti vogts as kenny miller 's second-half equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw with world cup finalists germany in saturday 's euro 2004 qualifier .
fredi bobic gave the visitors the lead after 23 minutes but scotland - managed by the man who led germany to their third european championship success in 1996 - never let their heads drop and miller 's equaliser 20 minutes from time ensured them a merited point .
the result leaves group five still impossible to call .
germany , who visit the faroe islands on wednesday , lead the way with eight points from four games .
scotland also have eight but from five games , while lithuania , who host iceland on wednesday , have seven from five .
passionate display the pressure should also ease on vogts after the memory of some depressing defeats were swept away by a passionate display that handed scotland their most impressive result in years .
they took the initiative from the start , not allowing the visitors to settle as they snapped into the tackle .
germany looked tired and short of ideas .
their last three competitive results have been a a 2-1 home win over the faroes , a 1-1 home draw with lithuania and now this draw at hampden .
scotland , while lacking the necessary penetration , looked likelier to find an opener but were undone by poor marking when torsten frings was given far too much room wide on the right and bobic rose unmarked and to send a powerful header into the ground and over keeper robert douglas . it was a poor goal to concede and perhaps underlined why scotland slipped to a lowly 64th in the fifa standings earlier this week .
they should have found the equaliser four minutes into the second half when cameron miskicked in front of goal after oliver kahn had blocked a fierce steve crawford shot . made amends cameron made amends in the 69th minute , however .
christian woerns handled and cameron 's quickly-taken free kick saw his wolverhampton wanderers team mate miller scamper clear and plant the ball low beyond kahn .
the goal shook germany into action and they could have clinched the win after missing a succession of chances in the closing moments as bobic fired wide while douglas was at full stretch to turn away a schneider free kick .
but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .
" it was a great performance from my team and for scottish football , " said vogts , who has been widely criticised after a series of poor showings in friendlies .
" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .
germany coach rudi voeller said .
" we can not be satisfied with this . " we did n't move well and gave away the ball far too often .
we could n't stamp our authority on the game , especially in midfield .
" in the last 20 minutes the players seemed to realise at last that a draw was not enough .
scotland were getting tired and we had a few chances , but i think a german victory would not have been fair .
two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands on wednesday . "
bobic said his team they did not play their own game .
" only after the equaliser did we start to play football , " said the goalscorer .

their last three competitive results have been a a 2-1 home win over the faroes , a 1-1 home draw with lithuania and now this draw at hampden .
scotland , while lacking the necessary penetration , looked likelier to find an opener but were undone by poor marking when torsten frings was given far too much room wide on the right and bobic rose unmarked and to send a powerful header into the ground and over keeper robert douglas . it was a poor goal to concede and perhaps underlined why scotland slipped to a lowly 64th in the fifa standings earlier this week .

christian woerns handled and cameron 's quickly-taken free kick saw his wolverhampton wanderers team mate miller scamper clear and plant the ball low beyond kahn .
the goal shook germany into action and they could have clinched the win after missing a succession of chances in the closing moments as bobic fired wide while douglas was at full stretch to turn away a schneider free kick .
but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .

" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .

but a world-class culture , shopping and nightlife beckon beyond the beer . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
it 's where tourists can don a pair of lederhosen , gulp one-liter mugs of beer , munch sausages galore , listen to the distinct , thick dialect of the bavarians and dance to the beat of umpah-music - all in the shadow of the alps .
ahhh , the typical german image . but quaint , village-like munich - it 's often called the " village of one million " - also has another side .
as one of the wealthiest cities in germany , munich has an affluent community , drawn from film , television , media and the good old-fashioned aristocracy , that likes to strut its stuff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's city hall and marienkirche the rich and famous even have a name , the " shickeria . "
they add a glossy edge to the city , bringing with them stylish stomping grounds including new bars , restaurants , and trendy boutiques . however , there is one thing that unites everyone in munich , the tourists and glitterati alike : the beer .
beer is one of the main reasons why millions flock to the capital of bavaria every year .
beer is what makes the world 's largest public festival , oktoberfest , so popular and has spawned countless beer gardens throughout the city , devoted to the consumption of this most-favored beverage . beware of rubber-necking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoyment for all the senses at oktoberfest munich is divided by the isar river , with most of the city 's treasures on the left bank .
many of the architectural jewels are concentrated around the marienplatz in the middle of the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- . without having to do much navigating you ca n't help but stumble by the 19th century neo-gothic neues rathaus -lrb- new city hall -rrb- .
fantastic photo opportunities await when the glockenspiel in the center of the rathaus strikes the hour .
copper figures emerge from the clock , dancing to the music of 43 bells .
-lrb- beware of tourist rubber-necking below this most iconic of munich experiences ! -rrb- steps away , there 's a great view from the spire of the gothic st. peter 's church - sometimes even as far as the alps .
and for lavish interiors , the elaborate 18th century rococo ceiling inside the heiliggeistkirche -lrb- church of the holy spirit -rrb- is a must . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english garden the other dominant and extremely popular building in the altstadt , not far from marienplatz , is the frauenkirche -lrb- church of our lady -rrb- , a gothic assembly hall and the final resting place of ludwig the bavarian .
the twin copper domes are one of the defining images of the münich skyline . shop and surf -lrb- and we do n't mean online -rrb- in between all these historical monuments is a great shopping district with a thriving café scene .
power shoppers head straight to maximilianstrasse , where gucci and all the heavy-hitters line the street . when locals are n't sipping coffee at the marienplatz , they are sunning themselves in europe 's largest , and perhaps most famous city park , the englischer garten . there 's a small lake and part of the isar river flows through the park , making it a good place to go boating , swimming and even surfing .
-lrb- yes , real surfing : swells in a portion of the isar river known as eisbach create great surfing conditions - well , at least good enough for alp-locked beach bum wannabes . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese tower the many paths winding through the park are popular with joggers and rollerbladers , and the beer garden at the chinesischer turm -lrb- chinese tower -rrb- , is the gathering place in the summer . south of the altstadt are the adjoining gärtner and glockenbach quarters , both of which have benefited from the city 's rising hipster population .
around gärtnerplatz , and just to the west in glockenbach , independent designers and up-and-coming restauranteurs have set up shop . further east across the river , another neighborhood , haidhausen , is garnering a bit of attention .
around weissenburger platz and rosenheimer platz , new restaurants and shops open monthly . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de readers share german adventures planning a trip to germany this year ?

poland 's voters gave 77 percent of their " yes " votes to the referendum in joining the eu .
only 23 percent voted " no " with a voter turnout of 58 percent .
" the biggest winner is poland , " said an ebullient lezek miller , the country 's prime minister .
" i am so very happy . "
the vote clears the way to accession for poland , the largest of 10 new countries to join the 15-member european union .
observers say it is one more in a string of victories for the former communist country . in the lead-up to the iraq war , poland profiled itself by supporting the u.s.-led invasion and was promptly awarded a prestigious assignment in guarding postwar iraq and a visit by president george w. bush .
in the union , poland is expected to quickly make its presence felt , with a population of 38 million dwarfing all but five current members of the eu .
european leaders , including poland 's neighbor germany , greeted the results warmly .
" there was never any doubt about poland belonging to europe , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement .
" with their clear vote in favor of the eu the people of poland have taken advantage of this historic chance . "
catholic church , farmers had doubts but there were doubts about whether poles wanted to join the european union .
the country 's farmers , a significant political lobby , were angered that current eu members like france and germany would get double as much in eu farm subsidies .
the polish catholic church was wary the eu would interfere with the country 's anti-abortion stance .
through hard negotiation by the polish government during accession talks in copenhagen in december , and the pro-eu blessings of the pope , the naysayers began to lose footing . a poll last week of polish farmers indicated that 52 percent would vote in favor of the eu during the two-day referendum .
to remove any possible doubts , the government recruited soccer stars and beauty queens in a pro-eu campaign that bombarded airwaves and newsprint leading up to the vote .
their decision to hold the referendum over two days helped as well , with enough people coming the second day to push the country over the 50 percent voter turnout required .

poland 's voters gave 77 percent of their " yes " votes to the referendum in joining the eu .
only 23 percent voted " no " with a voter turnout of 58 percent .
" the biggest winner is poland , " said an ebullient lezek miller , the country 's prime minister .
" i am so very happy . "
the vote clears the way to accession for poland , the largest of 10 new countries to join the 15-member european union .
observers say it is one more in a string of victories for the former communist country . in the lead-up to the iraq war , poland profiled itself by supporting the u.s.-led invasion and was promptly awarded a prestigious assignment in guarding postwar iraq and a visit by president george w. bush .
in the union , poland is expected to quickly make its presence felt , with a population of 38 million dwarfing all but five current members of the eu .
european leaders , including poland 's neighbor germany , greeted the results warmly .
" there was never any doubt about poland belonging to europe , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement .
" with their clear vote in favor of the eu the people of poland have taken advantage of this historic chance . "
catholic church , farmers had doubts but there were doubts about whether poles wanted to join the european union .
the country 's farmers , a significant political lobby , were angered that current eu members like france and germany would get double as much in eu farm subsidies .
the polish catholic church was wary the eu would interfere with the country 's anti-abortion stance .

saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way . scotland enjoyed their best result under german coach berti vogts as kenny miller 's second-half equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw with world cup finalists germany in saturday 's euro 2004 qualifier .
fredi bobic gave the visitors the lead after 23 minutes but scotland - managed by the man who led germany to their third european championship success in 1996 - never let their heads drop and miller 's equaliser 20 minutes from time ensured them a merited point .
the result leaves group five still impossible to call .
germany , who visit the faroe islands on wednesday , lead the way with eight points from four games .
scotland also have eight but from five games , while lithuania , who host iceland on wednesday , have seven from five .
passionate display the pressure should also ease on vogts after the memory of some depressing defeats were swept away by a passionate display that handed scotland their most impressive result in years .
they took the initiative from the start , not allowing the visitors to settle as they snapped into the tackle .
germany looked tired and short of ideas .
their last three competitive results have been a a 2-1 home win over the faroes , a 1-1 home draw with lithuania and now this draw at hampden .
scotland , while lacking the necessary penetration , looked likelier to find an opener but were undone by poor marking when torsten frings was given far too much room wide on the right and bobic rose unmarked and to send a powerful header into the ground and over keeper robert douglas . it was a poor goal to concede and perhaps underlined why scotland slipped to a lowly 64th in the fifa standings earlier this week .
they should have found the equaliser four minutes into the second half when cameron miskicked in front of goal after oliver kahn had blocked a fierce steve crawford shot . made amends cameron made amends in the 69th minute , however .
christian woerns handled and cameron 's quickly-taken free kick saw his wolverhampton wanderers team mate miller scamper clear and plant the ball low beyond kahn .
the goal shook germany into action and they could have clinched the win after missing a succession of chances in the closing moments as bobic fired wide while douglas was at full stretch to turn away a schneider free kick .
but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .
" it was a great performance from my team and for scottish football , " said vogts , who has been widely criticised after a series of poor showings in friendlies .
" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .
germany coach rudi voeller said .
" we can not be satisfied with this . " we did n't move well and gave away the ball far too often .
we could n't stamp our authority on the game , especially in midfield .
" in the last 20 minutes the players seemed to realise at last that a draw was not enough .
scotland were getting tired and we had a few chances , but i think a german victory would not have been fair .
two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands on wednesday . "
bobic said his team they did not play their own game .
" only after the equaliser did we start to play football , " said the goalscorer .
" before that we were just fighting .

but a world-class culture , shopping and nightlife beckon beyond the beer . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
it 's where tourists can don a pair of lederhosen , gulp one-liter mugs of beer , munch sausages galore , listen to the distinct , thick dialect of the bavarians and dance to the beat of umpah-music - all in the shadow of the alps .
ahhh , the typical german image . but quaint , village-like munich - it 's often called the " village of one million " - also has another side .
as one of the wealthiest cities in germany , munich has an affluent community , drawn from film , television , media and the good old-fashioned aristocracy , that likes to strut its stuff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's city hall and marienkirche the rich and famous even have a name , the " shickeria . "
they add a glossy edge to the city , bringing with them stylish stomping grounds including new bars , restaurants , and trendy boutiques . however , there is one thing that unites everyone in munich , the tourists and glitterati alike : the beer .
beer is one of the main reasons why millions flock to the capital of bavaria every year .
beer is what makes the world 's largest public festival , oktoberfest , so popular and has spawned countless beer gardens throughout the city , devoted to the consumption of this most-favored beverage . beware of rubber-necking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoyment for all the senses at oktoberfest munich is divided by the isar river , with most of the city 's treasures on the left bank .
many of the architectural jewels are concentrated around the marienplatz in the middle of the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- . without having to do much navigating you ca n't help but stumble by the 19th century neo-gothic neues rathaus -lrb- new city hall -rrb- .
fantastic photo opportunities await when the glockenspiel in the center of the rathaus strikes the hour .
copper figures emerge from the clock , dancing to the music of 43 bells .
-lrb- beware of tourist rubber-necking below this most iconic of munich experiences ! -rrb- steps away , there 's a great view from the spire of the gothic st. peter 's church - sometimes even as far as the alps .
and for lavish interiors , the elaborate 18th century rococo ceiling inside the heiliggeistkirche -lrb- church of the holy spirit -rrb- is a must . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english garden the other dominant and extremely popular building in the altstadt , not far from marienplatz , is the frauenkirche -lrb- church of our lady -rrb- , a gothic assembly hall and the final resting place of ludwig the bavarian .
the twin copper domes are one of the defining images of the münich skyline . shop and surf -lrb- and we do n't mean online -rrb- in between all these historical monuments is a great shopping district with a thriving café scene .
power shoppers head straight to maximilianstrasse , where gucci and all the heavy-hitters line the street . when locals are n't sipping coffee at the marienplatz , they are sunning themselves in europe 's largest , and perhaps most famous city park , the englischer garten . there 's a small lake and part of the isar river flows through the park , making it a good place to go boating , swimming and even surfing .
-lrb- yes , real surfing : swells in a portion of the isar river known as eisbach create great surfing conditions - well , at least good enough for alp-locked beach bum wannabes . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese tower the many paths winding through the park are popular with joggers and rollerbladers , and the beer garden at the chinesischer turm -lrb- chinese tower -rrb- , is the gathering place in the summer . south of the altstadt are the adjoining gärtner and glockenbach quarters , both of which have benefited from the city 's rising hipster population .

saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way . scotland enjoyed their best result under german coach berti vogts as kenny miller 's second-half equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw with world cup finalists germany in saturday 's euro 2004 qualifier .
fredi bobic gave the visitors the lead after 23 minutes but scotland - managed by the man who led germany to their third european championship success in 1996 - never let their heads drop and miller 's equaliser 20 minutes from time ensured them a merited point .
the result leaves group five still impossible to call .
germany , who visit the faroe islands on wednesday , lead the way with eight points from four games .
scotland also have eight but from five games , while lithuania , who host iceland on wednesday , have seven from five .
passionate display the pressure should also ease on vogts after the memory of some depressing defeats were swept away by a passionate display that handed scotland their most impressive result in years .
they took the initiative from the start , not allowing the visitors to settle as they snapped into the tackle .
germany looked tired and short of ideas .
their last three competitive results have been a a 2-1 home win over the faroes , a 1-1 home draw with lithuania and now this draw at hampden .
scotland , while lacking the necessary penetration , looked likelier to find an opener but were undone by poor marking when torsten frings was given far too much room wide on the right and bobic rose unmarked and to send a powerful header into the ground and over keeper robert douglas . it was a poor goal to concede and perhaps underlined why scotland slipped to a lowly 64th in the fifa standings earlier this week .
they should have found the equaliser four minutes into the second half when cameron miskicked in front of goal after oliver kahn had blocked a fierce steve crawford shot . made amends cameron made amends in the 69th minute , however .
christian woerns handled and cameron 's quickly-taken free kick saw his wolverhampton wanderers team mate miller scamper clear and plant the ball low beyond kahn .
the goal shook germany into action and they could have clinched the win after missing a succession of chances in the closing moments as bobic fired wide while douglas was at full stretch to turn away a schneider free kick .
but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .
" it was a great performance from my team and for scottish football , " said vogts , who has been widely criticised after a series of poor showings in friendlies .
" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .
germany coach rudi voeller said .
" we can not be satisfied with this . " we did n't move well and gave away the ball far too often .
we could n't stamp our authority on the game , especially in midfield .
" in the last 20 minutes the players seemed to realise at last that a draw was not enough .
scotland were getting tired and we had a few chances , but i think a german victory would not have been fair .
two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands on wednesday . "
bobic said his team they did not play their own game .
" only after the equaliser did we start to play football , " said the goalscorer .

but a world-class culture , shopping and nightlife beckon beyond the beer . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
it 's where tourists can don a pair of lederhosen , gulp one-liter mugs of beer , munch sausages galore , listen to the distinct , thick dialect of the bavarians and dance to the beat of umpah-music - all in the shadow of the alps .
ahhh , the typical german image . but quaint , village-like munich - it 's often called the " village of one million " - also has another side .
as one of the wealthiest cities in germany , munich has an affluent community , drawn from film , television , media and the good old-fashioned aristocracy , that likes to strut its stuff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's city hall and marienkirche the rich and famous even have a name , the " shickeria . "
they add a glossy edge to the city , bringing with them stylish stomping grounds including new bars , restaurants , and trendy boutiques . however , there is one thing that unites everyone in munich , the tourists and glitterati alike : the beer .
beer is one of the main reasons why millions flock to the capital of bavaria every year .
beer is what makes the world 's largest public festival , oktoberfest , so popular and has spawned countless beer gardens throughout the city , devoted to the consumption of this most-favored beverage . beware of rubber-necking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoyment for all the senses at oktoberfest munich is divided by the isar river , with most of the city 's treasures on the left bank .
many of the architectural jewels are concentrated around the marienplatz in the middle of the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- . without having to do much navigating you ca n't help but stumble by the 19th century neo-gothic neues rathaus -lrb- new city hall -rrb- .
fantastic photo opportunities await when the glockenspiel in the center of the rathaus strikes the hour .
copper figures emerge from the clock , dancing to the music of 43 bells .
-lrb- beware of tourist rubber-necking below this most iconic of munich experiences ! -rrb- steps away , there 's a great view from the spire of the gothic st. peter 's church - sometimes even as far as the alps .
and for lavish interiors , the elaborate 18th century rococo ceiling inside the heiliggeistkirche -lrb- church of the holy spirit -rrb- is a must . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english garden the other dominant and extremely popular building in the altstadt , not far from marienplatz , is the frauenkirche -lrb- church of our lady -rrb- , a gothic assembly hall and the final resting place of ludwig the bavarian .
the twin copper domes are one of the defining images of the münich skyline . shop and surf -lrb- and we do n't mean online -rrb- in between all these historical monuments is a great shopping district with a thriving café scene .
power shoppers head straight to maximilianstrasse , where gucci and all the heavy-hitters line the street . when locals are n't sipping coffee at the marienplatz , they are sunning themselves in europe 's largest , and perhaps most famous city park , the englischer garten . there 's a small lake and part of the isar river flows through the park , making it a good place to go boating , swimming and even surfing .
-lrb- yes , real surfing : swells in a portion of the isar river known as eisbach create great surfing conditions - well , at least good enough for alp-locked beach bum wannabes . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese tower the many paths winding through the park are popular with joggers and rollerbladers , and the beer garden at the chinesischer turm -lrb- chinese tower -rrb- , is the gathering place in the summer . south of the altstadt are the adjoining gärtner and glockenbach quarters , both of which have benefited from the city 's rising hipster population .
around gärtnerplatz , and just to the west in glockenbach , independent designers and up-and-coming restauranteurs have set up shop . further east across the river , another neighborhood , haidhausen , is garnering a bit of attention .

but a world-class culture , shopping and nightlife beckon beyond the beer . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
it 's where tourists can don a pair of lederhosen , gulp one-liter mugs of beer , munch sausages galore , listen to the distinct , thick dialect of the bavarians and dance to the beat of umpah-music - all in the shadow of the alps .
ahhh , the typical german image . but quaint , village-like munich - it 's often called the " village of one million " - also has another side .
as one of the wealthiest cities in germany , munich has an affluent community , drawn from film , television , media and the good old-fashioned aristocracy , that likes to strut its stuff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's city hall and marienkirche the rich and famous even have a name , the " shickeria . "
they add a glossy edge to the city , bringing with them stylish stomping grounds including new bars , restaurants , and trendy boutiques . however , there is one thing that unites everyone in munich , the tourists and glitterati alike : the beer .
beer is one of the main reasons why millions flock to the capital of bavaria every year .
beer is what makes the world 's largest public festival , oktoberfest , so popular and has spawned countless beer gardens throughout the city , devoted to the consumption of this most-favored beverage . beware of rubber-necking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoyment for all the senses at oktoberfest munich is divided by the isar river , with most of the city 's treasures on the left bank .
many of the architectural jewels are concentrated around the marienplatz in the middle of the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- . without having to do much navigating you ca n't help but stumble by the 19th century neo-gothic neues rathaus -lrb- new city hall -rrb- .

power shoppers head straight to maximilianstrasse , where gucci and all the heavy-hitters line the street . when locals are n't sipping coffee at the marienplatz , they are sunning themselves in europe 's largest , and perhaps most famous city park , the englischer garten . there 's a small lake and part of the isar river flows through the park , making it a good place to go boating , swimming and even surfing .

poland 's voters gave 77 percent of their " yes " votes to the referendum in joining the eu .
only 23 percent voted " no " with a voter turnout of 58 percent .
" the biggest winner is poland , " said an ebullient lezek miller , the country 's prime minister .
" i am so very happy . "
the vote clears the way to accession for poland , the largest of 10 new countries to join the 15-member european union .
observers say it is one more in a string of victories for the former communist country . in the lead-up to the iraq war , poland profiled itself by supporting the u.s.-led invasion and was promptly awarded a prestigious assignment in guarding postwar iraq and a visit by president george w. bush .
in the union , poland is expected to quickly make its presence felt , with a population of 38 million dwarfing all but five current members of the eu .
european leaders , including poland 's neighbor germany , greeted the results warmly .
" there was never any doubt about poland belonging to europe , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement .
" with their clear vote in favor of the eu the people of poland have taken advantage of this historic chance . "
catholic church , farmers had doubts but there were doubts about whether poles wanted to join the european union .
the country 's farmers , a significant political lobby , were angered that current eu members like france and germany would get double as much in eu farm subsidies .
the polish catholic church was wary the eu would interfere with the country 's anti-abortion stance .
through hard negotiation by the polish government during accession talks in copenhagen in december , and the pro-eu blessings of the pope , the naysayers began to lose footing . a poll last week of polish farmers indicated that 52 percent would vote in favor of the eu during the two-day referendum .
to remove any possible doubts , the government recruited soccer stars and beauty queens in a pro-eu campaign that bombarded airwaves and newsprint leading up to the vote .
their decision to hold the referendum over two days helped as well , with enough people coming the second day to push the country over the 50 percent voter turnout required .
poland is the sixth country of the new 10 to hold a referendum .
the czech republic will hold a referendum next weekend , estonia and latvia will follow in the fall . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder visits poland ahead of eu vote germany 's chancellor traveled to poland wednesday to rally the " yes " vote ahead of this weekend 's eu accession referendum .

saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way . scotland enjoyed their best result under german coach berti vogts as kenny miller 's second-half equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw with world cup finalists germany in saturday 's euro 2004 qualifier .
fredi bobic gave the visitors the lead after 23 minutes but scotland - managed by the man who led germany to their third european championship success in 1996 - never let their heads drop and miller 's equaliser 20 minutes from time ensured them a merited point .
the result leaves group five still impossible to call .
germany , who visit the faroe islands on wednesday , lead the way with eight points from four games .
scotland also have eight but from five games , while lithuania , who host iceland on wednesday , have seven from five .
passionate display the pressure should also ease on vogts after the memory of some depressing defeats were swept away by a passionate display that handed scotland their most impressive result in years .
they took the initiative from the start , not allowing the visitors to settle as they snapped into the tackle .
germany looked tired and short of ideas .
their last three competitive results have been a a 2-1 home win over the faroes , a 1-1 home draw with lithuania and now this draw at hampden .
scotland , while lacking the necessary penetration , looked likelier to find an opener but were undone by poor marking when torsten frings was given far too much room wide on the right and bobic rose unmarked and to send a powerful header into the ground and over keeper robert douglas . it was a poor goal to concede and perhaps underlined why scotland slipped to a lowly 64th in the fifa standings earlier this week .
they should have found the equaliser four minutes into the second half when cameron miskicked in front of goal after oliver kahn had blocked a fierce steve crawford shot . made amends cameron made amends in the 69th minute , however .
christian woerns handled and cameron 's quickly-taken free kick saw his wolverhampton wanderers team mate miller scamper clear and plant the ball low beyond kahn .
the goal shook germany into action and they could have clinched the win after missing a succession of chances in the closing moments as bobic fired wide while douglas was at full stretch to turn away a schneider free kick .
but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .
" it was a great performance from my team and for scottish football , " said vogts , who has been widely criticised after a series of poor showings in friendlies .
" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .
germany coach rudi voeller said .
" we can not be satisfied with this . " we did n't move well and gave away the ball far too often .
we could n't stamp our authority on the game , especially in midfield .
" in the last 20 minutes the players seemed to realise at last that a draw was not enough .
scotland were getting tired and we had a few chances , but i think a german victory would not have been fair .
two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands on wednesday . "
bobic said his team they did not play their own game .
" only after the equaliser did we start to play football , " said the goalscorer .

poland 's voters gave 77 percent of their " yes " votes to the referendum in joining the eu .
only 23 percent voted " no " with a voter turnout of 58 percent .
" the biggest winner is poland , " said an ebullient lezek miller , the country 's prime minister .
" i am so very happy . "
the vote clears the way to accession for poland , the largest of 10 new countries to join the 15-member european union .
observers say it is one more in a string of victories for the former communist country . in the lead-up to the iraq war , poland profiled itself by supporting the u.s.-led invasion and was promptly awarded a prestigious assignment in guarding postwar iraq and a visit by president george w. bush .
in the union , poland is expected to quickly make its presence felt , with a population of 38 million dwarfing all but five current members of the eu .
european leaders , including poland 's neighbor germany , greeted the results warmly .
" there was never any doubt about poland belonging to europe , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement .
" with their clear vote in favor of the eu the people of poland have taken advantage of this historic chance . "
catholic church , farmers had doubts but there were doubts about whether poles wanted to join the european union .
the country 's farmers , a significant political lobby , were angered that current eu members like france and germany would get double as much in eu farm subsidies .
the polish catholic church was wary the eu would interfere with the country 's anti-abortion stance .
through hard negotiation by the polish government during accession talks in copenhagen in december , and the pro-eu blessings of the pope , the naysayers began to lose footing . a poll last week of polish farmers indicated that 52 percent would vote in favor of the eu during the two-day referendum .
to remove any possible doubts , the government recruited soccer stars and beauty queens in a pro-eu campaign that bombarded airwaves and newsprint leading up to the vote .
their decision to hold the referendum over two days helped as well , with enough people coming the second day to push the country over the 50 percent voter turnout required .

saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way . scotland enjoyed their best result under german coach berti vogts as kenny miller 's second-half equaliser earned them a 1-1 draw with world cup finalists germany in saturday 's euro 2004 qualifier .
fredi bobic gave the visitors the lead after 23 minutes but scotland - managed by the man who led germany to their third european championship success in 1996 - never let their heads drop and miller 's equaliser 20 minutes from time ensured them a merited point .
the result leaves group five still impossible to call .
germany , who visit the faroe islands on wednesday , lead the way with eight points from four games .
scotland also have eight but from five games , while lithuania , who host iceland on wednesday , have seven from five .
passionate display the pressure should also ease on vogts after the memory of some depressing defeats were swept away by a passionate display that handed scotland their most impressive result in years .
they took the initiative from the start , not allowing the visitors to settle as they snapped into the tackle .
germany looked tired and short of ideas .
their last three competitive results have been a a 2-1 home win over the faroes , a 1-1 home draw with lithuania and now this draw at hampden .
scotland , while lacking the necessary penetration , looked likelier to find an opener but were undone by poor marking when torsten frings was given far too much room wide on the right and bobic rose unmarked and to send a powerful header into the ground and over keeper robert douglas . it was a poor goal to concede and perhaps underlined why scotland slipped to a lowly 64th in the fifa standings earlier this week .
they should have found the equaliser four minutes into the second half when cameron miskicked in front of goal after oliver kahn had blocked a fierce steve crawford shot . made amends cameron made amends in the 69th minute , however .
christian woerns handled and cameron 's quickly-taken free kick saw his wolverhampton wanderers team mate miller scamper clear and plant the ball low beyond kahn .
the goal shook germany into action and they could have clinched the win after missing a succession of chances in the closing moments as bobic fired wide while douglas was at full stretch to turn away a schneider free kick .
but scotland held out to take a point and a deserved ovation from most of the 46,000 fans .
" it was a great performance from my team and for scottish football , " said vogts , who has been widely criticised after a series of poor showings in friendlies .
" the support was good , it was a great match , a great equaliser .
in the first half they had one chance , one goal - but we came back . "
vogts had special praise for impressive celtic midfielder paul lambert , who he persuaded to come out of international retirement to help in the qualifying campaign .
" i saw a big scottish captain , he was the leader on the pitch , worked hard , kept the ball very well and it was an outstanding performance , " said vogts , who now has to try to prize a few more months out of the 33-year-old .
germany coach rudi voeller said .
" we can not be satisfied with this . " we did n't move well and gave away the ball far too often .
we could n't stamp our authority on the game , especially in midfield .
" in the last 20 minutes the players seemed to realise at last that a draw was not enough .
scotland were getting tired and we had a few chances , but i think a german victory would not have been fair .
two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands on wednesday . "
bobic said his team they did not play their own game .
" only after the equaliser did we start to play football , " said the goalscorer .
" before that we were just fighting .
we should have used our playing skills because that 's what makes the difference between us and scotland but we could n't do that .

but a world-class culture , shopping and nightlife beckon beyond the beer . for many good reasons , munich is the second most popular destination in germany .
it 's where tourists can don a pair of lederhosen , gulp one-liter mugs of beer , munch sausages galore , listen to the distinct , thick dialect of the bavarians and dance to the beat of umpah-music - all in the shadow of the alps .
ahhh , the typical german image . but quaint , village-like munich - it 's often called the " village of one million " - also has another side .
as one of the wealthiest cities in germany , munich has an affluent community , drawn from film , television , media and the good old-fashioned aristocracy , that likes to strut its stuff . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's city hall and marienkirche the rich and famous even have a name , the " shickeria . "
they add a glossy edge to the city , bringing with them stylish stomping grounds including new bars , restaurants , and trendy boutiques . however , there is one thing that unites everyone in munich , the tourists and glitterati alike : the beer .
beer is one of the main reasons why millions flock to the capital of bavaria every year .
beer is what makes the world 's largest public festival , oktoberfest , so popular and has spawned countless beer gardens throughout the city , devoted to the consumption of this most-favored beverage . beware of rubber-necking bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enjoyment for all the senses at oktoberfest munich is divided by the isar river , with most of the city 's treasures on the left bank .
many of the architectural jewels are concentrated around the marienplatz in the middle of the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- . without having to do much navigating you ca n't help but stumble by the 19th century neo-gothic neues rathaus -lrb- new city hall -rrb- .
fantastic photo opportunities await when the glockenspiel in the center of the rathaus strikes the hour .
copper figures emerge from the clock , dancing to the music of 43 bells .
-lrb- beware of tourist rubber-necking below this most iconic of munich experiences ! -rrb- steps away , there 's a great view from the spire of the gothic st. peter 's church - sometimes even as far as the alps .
and for lavish interiors , the elaborate 18th century rococo ceiling inside the heiliggeistkirche -lrb- church of the holy spirit -rrb- is a must . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the english garden the other dominant and extremely popular building in the altstadt , not far from marienplatz , is the frauenkirche -lrb- church of our lady -rrb- , a gothic assembly hall and the final resting place of ludwig the bavarian .
the twin copper domes are one of the defining images of the münich skyline . shop and surf -lrb- and we do n't mean online -rrb- in between all these historical monuments is a great shopping district with a thriving café scene .
power shoppers head straight to maximilianstrasse , where gucci and all the heavy-hitters line the street . when locals are n't sipping coffee at the marienplatz , they are sunning themselves in europe 's largest , and perhaps most famous city park , the englischer garten . there 's a small lake and part of the isar river flows through the park , making it a good place to go boating , swimming and even surfing .
-lrb- yes , real surfing : swells in a portion of the isar river known as eisbach create great surfing conditions - well , at least good enough for alp-locked beach bum wannabes . -rrb- bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chinese tower the many paths winding through the park are popular with joggers and rollerbladers , and the beer garden at the chinesischer turm -lrb- chinese tower -rrb- , is the gathering place in the summer . south of the altstadt are the adjoining gärtner and glockenbach quarters , both of which have benefited from the city 's rising hipster population .
around gärtnerplatz , and just to the west in glockenbach , independent designers and up-and-coming restauranteurs have set up shop . further east across the river , another neighborhood , haidhausen , is garnering a bit of attention .

poland 's voters gave 77 percent of their " yes " votes to the referendum in joining the eu .
only 23 percent voted " no " with a voter turnout of 58 percent .
" the biggest winner is poland , " said an ebullient lezek miller , the country 's prime minister .
" i am so very happy . "
the vote clears the way to accession for poland , the largest of 10 new countries to join the 15-member european union .
observers say it is one more in a string of victories for the former communist country . in the lead-up to the iraq war , poland profiled itself by supporting the u.s.-led invasion and was promptly awarded a prestigious assignment in guarding postwar iraq and a visit by president george w. bush .
in the union , poland is expected to quickly make its presence felt , with a population of 38 million dwarfing all but five current members of the eu .
european leaders , including poland 's neighbor germany , greeted the results warmly .
" there was never any doubt about poland belonging to europe , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement .
" with their clear vote in favor of the eu the people of poland have taken advantage of this historic chance . "
catholic church , farmers had doubts but there were doubts about whether poles wanted to join the european union .
the country 's farmers , a significant political lobby , were angered that current eu members like france and germany would get double as much in eu farm subsidies .
the polish catholic church was wary the eu would interfere with the country 's anti-abortion stance .
through hard negotiation by the polish government during accession talks in copenhagen in december , and the pro-eu blessings of the pope , the naysayers began to lose footing . a poll last week of polish farmers indicated that 52 percent would vote in favor of the eu during the two-day referendum .
to remove any possible doubts , the government recruited soccer stars and beauty queens in a pro-eu campaign that bombarded airwaves and newsprint leading up to the vote .

poland 's voters gave 77 percent of their " yes " votes to the referendum in joining the eu .
only 23 percent voted " no " with a voter turnout of 58 percent .
" the biggest winner is poland , " said an ebullient lezek miller , the country 's prime minister .
" i am so very happy . "
the vote clears the way to accession for poland , the largest of 10 new countries to join the 15-member european union .
observers say it is one more in a string of victories for the former communist country . in the lead-up to the iraq war , poland profiled itself by supporting the u.s.-led invasion and was promptly awarded a prestigious assignment in guarding postwar iraq and a visit by president george w. bush .
in the union , poland is expected to quickly make its presence felt , with a population of 38 million dwarfing all but five current members of the eu .
european leaders , including poland 's neighbor germany , greeted the results warmly .
" there was never any doubt about poland belonging to europe , " german chancellor gerhard schröder said in a statement .
" with their clear vote in favor of the eu the people of poland have taken advantage of this historic chance . "
catholic church , farmers had doubts but there were doubts about whether poles wanted to join the european union .
the country 's farmers , a significant political lobby , were angered that current eu members like france and germany would get double as much in eu farm subsidies .
the polish catholic church was wary the eu would interfere with the country 's anti-abortion stance .
through hard negotiation by the polish government during accession talks in copenhagen in december , and the pro-eu blessings of the pope , the naysayers began to lose footing . a poll last week of polish farmers indicated that 52 percent would vote in favor of the eu during the two-day referendum .
to remove any possible doubts , the government recruited soccer stars and beauty queens in a pro-eu campaign that bombarded airwaves and newsprint leading up to the vote .

the council for the protection of rural england warns of the " needless destruction " of devon countryside if the go-ahead is given .
the plans are for 3,500 new dwellings at sherford , south hams and 2,900 houses , as well as employment development , at broadclyst , near exeter .
the devon branch of cpre wants the plans to be withdrawn and replaced by more sustainable alternatives .
new towns , new problems ? "
these proposals miss the point , which is how to make plymouth a place people want to live , work and invest in " jim woolcombe , council for the protection of rural england " plymouth 's housing needs are best met within the existing urban area , not outside it , " said jim woolcombe , chairman of cpre devon .
" those promoting the new settlement at sherford claim that it would help meet plymouth 's housing shortage .
" yet people want access to local services and employment and to retain links with the communities of which they are a part .
" it is impossible to ensure the new homes will go to local people .
" rather than meet local need for affordable housing the new settlements are likely to fuel further migration into devon . "
representatives of plymouth 's business community , including some developers , have also expressed concerns about the potential impact a new development would have on efforts to regenerate the city .
' serious harm ' " building a new settlement outside plymouth will undoubtedly harm prospects for the city 's regeneration by diverting resources , investment and effort away from areas in plymouth that need it most , " said mr woolcombe .
" we would like to see constructive alternatives considered .
" these proposals miss the point , which is how to make plymouth a place people want to live , work and invest in . "
the cpre said proposals for a new settlement in countryside at broadclyst near exeter were equally worrying .
it would be a dormitory settlement isolated from exeter 's economic centre , fostering car dependency and increasing congestion .
the council said it would do serious harm to east devon 's countryside and the quality of life of those who live and work there .
