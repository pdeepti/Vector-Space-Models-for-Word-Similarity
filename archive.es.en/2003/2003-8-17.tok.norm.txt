military and humanitarian aid should be separate from one another , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces as protection for civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .
first the military enters , then the aid organizations follow up with their humanitarian assistance ; the two tasks can not be combined . nina werkhäuser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend . after nearly a decade of discussion and several delays in the selection of a design , construction on berlin ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust is finally getting underway .
under the watchful eye of u.s. star architect peter eisenman , the first of a total 2,700 concrete steles will be selected and erected on a giant open square between the brandenburg gate and the city ’ s newly redeveloped potsdamer platz .
the presentation on saturday of the first group of gray concrete blocks , each measuring close to five meters in height and weighing several tons , is the first step towards completion of the mammoth monument in early 2005 .
having commissioned 10 differently-sized concrete slabs , the 71-year-old eisenman , who is regarded as one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture , is due to cast his eye over them before finally deciding which model will be duplicated in serial production .
starting in september the steles will be delivered to the site and slowly put in position .
after having dragged on for so long , first in the federal parliament , where politicians debated the very nature of constructing a physical memorial to the holocaust , and then in the architectural competition where experts took their time theorizing the question of what just such a monument should look like to the actual selection and financing of the project , the slow building process seems only fitting .
an undulating field of reflection the memorial itself is unlike any monument designed for berlin so far .
with the thousands of concrete steles lined up in rows across a 19,000-square-meter open area , it is slightly reminiscent of a graveyard .
" the place of no meaning , " as eisenman once referred to the site in the hopes of dispelling fears that he was trying to symbolize the death of the holocaust , however is intended as a confrontation with the past .
the visitor , who finds himself winding his way through the forest of steles , will be struck by how distant the busy city center seems , and how quiet and reflective – but not graveyard-like – the atmosphere is .
eisenman has said the design should give the impression of an " undulating field . "
there is no entrance or exit to the site ; no prescribed path way through the steles .
the uneven ground and the varying heigths of the steles are designed to create the sense of insecurity , but not overwhelming loss , eisenman has suggested .
the memorial will also include a subterranean information center at the edge of the site which will house a permanent exhibition dedicated to six million victims of the holocaust .
undaunted by graffiti risk despite the sensitivity of the project , eisenman has rejected having tight security around the memorial when it is opened .
set on one of berlin 's most prominent streets , close to the german capital 's central tiergarten park , some fear it could be an easy target for anti-semitic or attacks .
but eisenman wishes his monument to stay open for people to walk through whenever they want .
" like a prison or concentration camp , " eisenmann said the monument should survive attacks unscathed , as the steles are " all made out of concrete . "
he also said this week he would be unperturbed if the finished memorial became a target for graffiti artists .
in an interview with the german weekly news magazine stern , the architect acknowledged that " there are these destructive feelings once in a while , " but he added , " we can not keep everything squeaky clean .
that would be the same behavior as in the 1930s . "
eisenman previously said he did n't want the 2,700 steles to be treated with a special anti-graffiti-agent , maintaining that sprayers would find a way to paint on the stones if they really wanted to .
no bratwurst allowed but if graffiti is allowed , traditional german sausages are not .
eisenman said the most important thing for him is that no bratwurst stand is set up near the memorial when it opens to the public on may 8 , 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii .

after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend . after nearly a decade of discussion and several delays in the selection of a design , construction on berlin ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust is finally getting underway .
under the watchful eye of u.s. star architect peter eisenman , the first of a total 2,700 concrete steles will be selected and erected on a giant open square between the brandenburg gate and the city ’ s newly redeveloped potsdamer platz .
the presentation on saturday of the first group of gray concrete blocks , each measuring close to five meters in height and weighing several tons , is the first step towards completion of the mammoth monument in early 2005 .
having commissioned 10 differently-sized concrete slabs , the 71-year-old eisenman , who is regarded as one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture , is due to cast his eye over them before finally deciding which model will be duplicated in serial production .
starting in september the steles will be delivered to the site and slowly put in position .
after having dragged on for so long , first in the federal parliament , where politicians debated the very nature of constructing a physical memorial to the holocaust , and then in the architectural competition where experts took their time theorizing the question of what just such a monument should look like to the actual selection and financing of the project , the slow building process seems only fitting .
an undulating field of reflection the memorial itself is unlike any monument designed for berlin so far .
with the thousands of concrete steles lined up in rows across a 19,000-square-meter open area , it is slightly reminiscent of a graveyard .
" the place of no meaning , " as eisenman once referred to the site in the hopes of dispelling fears that he was trying to symbolize the death of the holocaust , however is intended as a confrontation with the past .
the visitor , who finds himself winding his way through the forest of steles , will be struck by how distant the busy city center seems , and how quiet and reflective – but not graveyard-like – the atmosphere is .
eisenman has said the design should give the impression of an " undulating field . "
there is no entrance or exit to the site ; no prescribed path way through the steles .
the uneven ground and the varying heigths of the steles are designed to create the sense of insecurity , but not overwhelming loss , eisenman has suggested .
the memorial will also include a subterranean information center at the edge of the site which will house a permanent exhibition dedicated to six million victims of the holocaust .
undaunted by graffiti risk despite the sensitivity of the project , eisenman has rejected having tight security around the memorial when it is opened .
set on one of berlin 's most prominent streets , close to the german capital 's central tiergarten park , some fear it could be an easy target for anti-semitic or attacks .
but eisenman wishes his monument to stay open for people to walk through whenever they want .
" like a prison or concentration camp , " eisenmann said the monument should survive attacks unscathed , as the steles are " all made out of concrete . "
he also said this week he would be unperturbed if the finished memorial became a target for graffiti artists .
in an interview with the german weekly news magazine stern , the architect acknowledged that " there are these destructive feelings once in a while , " but he added , " we can not keep everything squeaky clean .
that would be the same behavior as in the 1930s . "
eisenman previously said he did n't want the 2,700 steles to be treated with a special anti-graffiti-agent , maintaining that sprayers would find a way to paint on the stones if they really wanted to .
no bratwurst allowed but if graffiti is allowed , traditional german sausages are not .
eisenman said the most important thing for him is that no bratwurst stand is set up near the memorial when it opens to the public on may 8 , 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii .

military and humanitarian aid should be separate from one another , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces as protection for civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .

" we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .
first the military enters , then the aid organizations follow up with their humanitarian assistance ; the two tasks can not be combined . nina werkhäuser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend . after nearly a decade of discussion and several delays in the selection of a design , construction on berlin ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust is finally getting underway .
under the watchful eye of u.s. star architect peter eisenman , the first of a total 2,700 concrete steles will be selected and erected on a giant open square between the brandenburg gate and the city ’ s newly redeveloped potsdamer platz .
the presentation on saturday of the first group of gray concrete blocks , each measuring close to five meters in height and weighing several tons , is the first step towards completion of the mammoth monument in early 2005 .
having commissioned 10 differently-sized concrete slabs , the 71-year-old eisenman , who is regarded as one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture , is due to cast his eye over them before finally deciding which model will be duplicated in serial production .
starting in september the steles will be delivered to the site and slowly put in position .
after having dragged on for so long , first in the federal parliament , where politicians debated the very nature of constructing a physical memorial to the holocaust , and then in the architectural competition where experts took their time theorizing the question of what just such a monument should look like to the actual selection and financing of the project , the slow building process seems only fitting .
an undulating field of reflection the memorial itself is unlike any monument designed for berlin so far .
with the thousands of concrete steles lined up in rows across a 19,000-square-meter open area , it is slightly reminiscent of a graveyard .
" the place of no meaning , " as eisenman once referred to the site in the hopes of dispelling fears that he was trying to symbolize the death of the holocaust , however is intended as a confrontation with the past .
the visitor , who finds himself winding his way through the forest of steles , will be struck by how distant the busy city center seems , and how quiet and reflective – but not graveyard-like – the atmosphere is .
eisenman has said the design should give the impression of an " undulating field . "
there is no entrance or exit to the site ; no prescribed path way through the steles .
the uneven ground and the varying heigths of the steles are designed to create the sense of insecurity , but not overwhelming loss , eisenman has suggested .
the memorial will also include a subterranean information center at the edge of the site which will house a permanent exhibition dedicated to six million victims of the holocaust .
undaunted by graffiti risk despite the sensitivity of the project , eisenman has rejected having tight security around the memorial when it is opened .
set on one of berlin 's most prominent streets , close to the german capital 's central tiergarten park , some fear it could be an easy target for anti-semitic or attacks .
but eisenman wishes his monument to stay open for people to walk through whenever they want .
" like a prison or concentration camp , " eisenmann said the monument should survive attacks unscathed , as the steles are " all made out of concrete . "
he also said this week he would be unperturbed if the finished memorial became a target for graffiti artists .
in an interview with the german weekly news magazine stern , the architect acknowledged that " there are these destructive feelings once in a while , " but he added , " we can not keep everything squeaky clean .
that would be the same behavior as in the 1930s . "
eisenman previously said he did n't want the 2,700 steles to be treated with a special anti-graffiti-agent , maintaining that sprayers would find a way to paint on the stones if they really wanted to .
no bratwurst allowed but if graffiti is allowed , traditional german sausages are not .
eisenman said the most important thing for him is that no bratwurst stand is set up near the memorial when it opens to the public on may 8 , 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii .

the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .

after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend . after nearly a decade of discussion and several delays in the selection of a design , construction on berlin ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust is finally getting underway .
under the watchful eye of u.s. star architect peter eisenman , the first of a total 2,700 concrete steles will be selected and erected on a giant open square between the brandenburg gate and the city ’ s newly redeveloped potsdamer platz .
the presentation on saturday of the first group of gray concrete blocks , each measuring close to five meters in height and weighing several tons , is the first step towards completion of the mammoth monument in early 2005 .
having commissioned 10 differently-sized concrete slabs , the 71-year-old eisenman , who is regarded as one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture , is due to cast his eye over them before finally deciding which model will be duplicated in serial production .
starting in september the steles will be delivered to the site and slowly put in position .
after having dragged on for so long , first in the federal parliament , where politicians debated the very nature of constructing a physical memorial to the holocaust , and then in the architectural competition where experts took their time theorizing the question of what just such a monument should look like to the actual selection and financing of the project , the slow building process seems only fitting .
an undulating field of reflection the memorial itself is unlike any monument designed for berlin so far .
with the thousands of concrete steles lined up in rows across a 19,000-square-meter open area , it is slightly reminiscent of a graveyard .
" the place of no meaning , " as eisenman once referred to the site in the hopes of dispelling fears that he was trying to symbolize the death of the holocaust , however is intended as a confrontation with the past .
the visitor , who finds himself winding his way through the forest of steles , will be struck by how distant the busy city center seems , and how quiet and reflective – but not graveyard-like – the atmosphere is .
eisenman has said the design should give the impression of an " undulating field . "
there is no entrance or exit to the site ; no prescribed path way through the steles .
the uneven ground and the varying heigths of the steles are designed to create the sense of insecurity , but not overwhelming loss , eisenman has suggested .
the memorial will also include a subterranean information center at the edge of the site which will house a permanent exhibition dedicated to six million victims of the holocaust .
undaunted by graffiti risk despite the sensitivity of the project , eisenman has rejected having tight security around the memorial when it is opened .
set on one of berlin 's most prominent streets , close to the german capital 's central tiergarten park , some fear it could be an easy target for anti-semitic or attacks .
but eisenman wishes his monument to stay open for people to walk through whenever they want .
" like a prison or concentration camp , " eisenmann said the monument should survive attacks unscathed , as the steles are " all made out of concrete . "
he also said this week he would be unperturbed if the finished memorial became a target for graffiti artists .
in an interview with the german weekly news magazine stern , the architect acknowledged that " there are these destructive feelings once in a while , " but he added , " we can not keep everything squeaky clean .
that would be the same behavior as in the 1930s . "
eisenman previously said he did n't want the 2,700 steles to be treated with a special anti-graffiti-agent , maintaining that sprayers would find a way to paint on the stones if they really wanted to .
no bratwurst allowed but if graffiti is allowed , traditional german sausages are not .
eisenman said the most important thing for him is that no bratwurst stand is set up near the memorial when it opens to the public on may 8 , 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii .

after having dragged on for so long , first in the federal parliament , where politicians debated the very nature of constructing a physical memorial to the holocaust , and then in the architectural competition where experts took their time theorizing the question of what just such a monument should look like to the actual selection and financing of the project , the slow building process seems only fitting .
an undulating field of reflection the memorial itself is unlike any monument designed for berlin so far .
with the thousands of concrete steles lined up in rows across a 19,000-square-meter open area , it is slightly reminiscent of a graveyard .
" the place of no meaning , " as eisenman once referred to the site in the hopes of dispelling fears that he was trying to symbolize the death of the holocaust , however is intended as a confrontation with the past .
the visitor , who finds himself winding his way through the forest of steles , will be struck by how distant the busy city center seems , and how quiet and reflective – but not graveyard-like – the atmosphere is .
eisenman has said the design should give the impression of an " undulating field . "
there is no entrance or exit to the site ; no prescribed path way through the steles .
the uneven ground and the varying heigths of the steles are designed to create the sense of insecurity , but not overwhelming loss , eisenman has suggested .
the memorial will also include a subterranean information center at the edge of the site which will house a permanent exhibition dedicated to six million victims of the holocaust .
undaunted by graffiti risk despite the sensitivity of the project , eisenman has rejected having tight security around the memorial when it is opened .
set on one of berlin 's most prominent streets , close to the german capital 's central tiergarten park , some fear it could be an easy target for anti-semitic or attacks .
but eisenman wishes his monument to stay open for people to walk through whenever they want .
" like a prison or concentration camp , " eisenmann said the monument should survive attacks unscathed , as the steles are " all made out of concrete . "
he also said this week he would be unperturbed if the finished memorial became a target for graffiti artists .
in an interview with the german weekly news magazine stern , the architect acknowledged that " there are these destructive feelings once in a while , " but he added , " we can not keep everything squeaky clean .
that would be the same behavior as in the 1930s . "
eisenman previously said he did n't want the 2,700 steles to be treated with a special anti-graffiti-agent , maintaining that sprayers would find a way to paint on the stones if they really wanted to .
no bratwurst allowed but if graffiti is allowed , traditional german sausages are not .
eisenman said the most important thing for him is that no bratwurst stand is set up near the memorial when it opens to the public on may 8 , 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii .

military and humanitarian aid should be separate from one another , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces as protection for civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .
first the military enters , then the aid organizations follow up with their humanitarian assistance ; the two tasks can not be combined . nina werkhäuser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend . after nearly a decade of discussion and several delays in the selection of a design , construction on berlin ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust is finally getting underway .
under the watchful eye of u.s. star architect peter eisenman , the first of a total 2,700 concrete steles will be selected and erected on a giant open square between the brandenburg gate and the city ’ s newly redeveloped potsdamer platz .
the presentation on saturday of the first group of gray concrete blocks , each measuring close to five meters in height and weighing several tons , is the first step towards completion of the mammoth monument in early 2005 .
having commissioned 10 differently-sized concrete slabs , the 71-year-old eisenman , who is regarded as one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture , is due to cast his eye over them before finally deciding which model will be duplicated in serial production .
starting in september the steles will be delivered to the site and slowly put in position .
after having dragged on for so long , first in the federal parliament , where politicians debated the very nature of constructing a physical memorial to the holocaust , and then in the architectural competition where experts took their time theorizing the question of what just such a monument should look like to the actual selection and financing of the project , the slow building process seems only fitting .

there is no entrance or exit to the site ; no prescribed path way through the steles .
the uneven ground and the varying heigths of the steles are designed to create the sense of insecurity , but not overwhelming loss , eisenman has suggested .

after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend . after nearly a decade of discussion and several delays in the selection of a design , construction on berlin ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust is finally getting underway .
under the watchful eye of u.s. star architect peter eisenman , the first of a total 2,700 concrete steles will be selected and erected on a giant open square between the brandenburg gate and the city ’ s newly redeveloped potsdamer platz .
the presentation on saturday of the first group of gray concrete blocks , each measuring close to five meters in height and weighing several tons , is the first step towards completion of the mammoth monument in early 2005 .
having commissioned 10 differently-sized concrete slabs , the 71-year-old eisenman , who is regarded as one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture , is due to cast his eye over them before finally deciding which model will be duplicated in serial production .
starting in september the steles will be delivered to the site and slowly put in position .
after having dragged on for so long , first in the federal parliament , where politicians debated the very nature of constructing a physical memorial to the holocaust , and then in the architectural competition where experts took their time theorizing the question of what just such a monument should look like to the actual selection and financing of the project , the slow building process seems only fitting .
an undulating field of reflection the memorial itself is unlike any monument designed for berlin so far .
with the thousands of concrete steles lined up in rows across a 19,000-square-meter open area , it is slightly reminiscent of a graveyard .
" the place of no meaning , " as eisenman once referred to the site in the hopes of dispelling fears that he was trying to symbolize the death of the holocaust , however is intended as a confrontation with the past .
the visitor , who finds himself winding his way through the forest of steles , will be struck by how distant the busy city center seems , and how quiet and reflective – but not graveyard-like – the atmosphere is .
eisenman has said the design should give the impression of an " undulating field . "
there is no entrance or exit to the site ; no prescribed path way through the steles .
the uneven ground and the varying heigths of the steles are designed to create the sense of insecurity , but not overwhelming loss , eisenman has suggested .
the memorial will also include a subterranean information center at the edge of the site which will house a permanent exhibition dedicated to six million victims of the holocaust .
undaunted by graffiti risk despite the sensitivity of the project , eisenman has rejected having tight security around the memorial when it is opened .
set on one of berlin 's most prominent streets , close to the german capital 's central tiergarten park , some fear it could be an easy target for anti-semitic or attacks .
but eisenman wishes his monument to stay open for people to walk through whenever they want .
" like a prison or concentration camp , " eisenmann said the monument should survive attacks unscathed , as the steles are " all made out of concrete . "
he also said this week he would be unperturbed if the finished memorial became a target for graffiti artists .
in an interview with the german weekly news magazine stern , the architect acknowledged that " there are these destructive feelings once in a while , " but he added , " we can not keep everything squeaky clean .
that would be the same behavior as in the 1930s . "
eisenman previously said he did n't want the 2,700 steles to be treated with a special anti-graffiti-agent , maintaining that sprayers would find a way to paint on the stones if they really wanted to .
no bratwurst allowed but if graffiti is allowed , traditional german sausages are not .
eisenman said the most important thing for him is that no bratwurst stand is set up near the memorial when it opens to the public on may 8 , 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii .
the commercialization of and profiting from the suffering of the holocaust is something he adamantly rejects . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to finally start holocaust memorial the 27.3 million euro holocuast memorial , fraught with delays , is expected to be opened in spring of 2005 -lrb- april 5 , 2003 -rrb- .

" we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .

baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.08.2003 berlin holocaust memorial takes shape großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " undulating field " of concrete steles dedicated to victims of the holocaust .
after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend . after nearly a decade of discussion and several delays in the selection of a design , construction on berlin ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust is finally getting underway .
under the watchful eye of u.s. star architect peter eisenman , the first of a total 2,700 concrete steles will be selected and erected on a giant open square between the brandenburg gate and the city ’ s newly redeveloped potsdamer platz .
the presentation on saturday of the first group of gray concrete blocks , each measuring close to five meters in height and weighing several tons , is the first step towards completion of the mammoth monument in early 2005 .
having commissioned 10 differently-sized concrete slabs , the 71-year-old eisenman , who is regarded as one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture , is due to cast his eye over them before finally deciding which model will be duplicated in serial production .
starting in september the steles will be delivered to the site and slowly put in position .
after having dragged on for so long , first in the federal parliament , where politicians debated the very nature of constructing a physical memorial to the holocaust , and then in the architectural competition where experts took their time theorizing the question of what just such a monument should look like to the actual selection and financing of the project , the slow building process seems only fitting .
an undulating field of reflection the memorial itself is unlike any monument designed for berlin so far .
with the thousands of concrete steles lined up in rows across a 19,000-square-meter open area , it is slightly reminiscent of a graveyard .
" the place of no meaning , " as eisenman once referred to the site in the hopes of dispelling fears that he was trying to symbolize the death of the holocaust , however is intended as a confrontation with the past .
the visitor , who finds himself winding his way through the forest of steles , will be struck by how distant the busy city center seems , and how quiet and reflective – but not graveyard-like – the atmosphere is .
eisenman has said the design should give the impression of an " undulating field . "
there is no entrance or exit to the site ; no prescribed path way through the steles .
the uneven ground and the varying heigths of the steles are designed to create the sense of insecurity , but not overwhelming loss , eisenman has suggested .
the memorial will also include a subterranean information center at the edge of the site which will house a permanent exhibition dedicated to six million victims of the holocaust .
undaunted by graffiti risk despite the sensitivity of the project , eisenman has rejected having tight security around the memorial when it is opened .
set on one of berlin 's most prominent streets , close to the german capital 's central tiergarten park , some fear it could be an easy target for anti-semitic or attacks .
but eisenman wishes his monument to stay open for people to walk through whenever they want .
" like a prison or concentration camp , " eisenmann said the monument should survive attacks unscathed , as the steles are " all made out of concrete . "
he also said this week he would be unperturbed if the finished memorial became a target for graffiti artists .
in an interview with the german weekly news magazine stern , the architect acknowledged that " there are these destructive feelings once in a while , " but he added , " we can not keep everything squeaky clean .
that would be the same behavior as in the 1930s . "
eisenman previously said he did n't want the 2,700 steles to be treated with a special anti-graffiti-agent , maintaining that sprayers would find a way to paint on the stones if they really wanted to .
no bratwurst allowed but if graffiti is allowed , traditional german sausages are not .
eisenman said the most important thing for him is that no bratwurst stand is set up near the memorial when it opens to the public on may 8 , 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii .
the commercialization of and profiting from the suffering of the holocaust is something he adamantly rejects . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin to finally start holocaust memorial the 27.3 million euro holocuast memorial , fraught with delays , is expected to be opened in spring of 2005 -lrb- april 5 , 2003 -rrb- .

after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend . after nearly a decade of discussion and several delays in the selection of a design , construction on berlin ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust is finally getting underway .
under the watchful eye of u.s. star architect peter eisenman , the first of a total 2,700 concrete steles will be selected and erected on a giant open square between the brandenburg gate and the city ’ s newly redeveloped potsdamer platz .
the presentation on saturday of the first group of gray concrete blocks , each measuring close to five meters in height and weighing several tons , is the first step towards completion of the mammoth monument in early 2005 .
having commissioned 10 differently-sized concrete slabs , the 71-year-old eisenman , who is regarded as one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture , is due to cast his eye over them before finally deciding which model will be duplicated in serial production .
starting in september the steles will be delivered to the site and slowly put in position .
after having dragged on for so long , first in the federal parliament , where politicians debated the very nature of constructing a physical memorial to the holocaust , and then in the architectural competition where experts took their time theorizing the question of what just such a monument should look like to the actual selection and financing of the project , the slow building process seems only fitting .
an undulating field of reflection the memorial itself is unlike any monument designed for berlin so far .
with the thousands of concrete steles lined up in rows across a 19,000-square-meter open area , it is slightly reminiscent of a graveyard .
" the place of no meaning , " as eisenman once referred to the site in the hopes of dispelling fears that he was trying to symbolize the death of the holocaust , however is intended as a confrontation with the past .
the visitor , who finds himself winding his way through the forest of steles , will be struck by how distant the busy city center seems , and how quiet and reflective – but not graveyard-like – the atmosphere is .
eisenman has said the design should give the impression of an " undulating field . "
there is no entrance or exit to the site ; no prescribed path way through the steles .
the uneven ground and the varying heigths of the steles are designed to create the sense of insecurity , but not overwhelming loss , eisenman has suggested .
the memorial will also include a subterranean information center at the edge of the site which will house a permanent exhibition dedicated to six million victims of the holocaust .
undaunted by graffiti risk despite the sensitivity of the project , eisenman has rejected having tight security around the memorial when it is opened .
set on one of berlin 's most prominent streets , close to the german capital 's central tiergarten park , some fear it could be an easy target for anti-semitic or attacks .
but eisenman wishes his monument to stay open for people to walk through whenever they want .
" like a prison or concentration camp , " eisenmann said the monument should survive attacks unscathed , as the steles are " all made out of concrete . "
he also said this week he would be unperturbed if the finished memorial became a target for graffiti artists .
in an interview with the german weekly news magazine stern , the architect acknowledged that " there are these destructive feelings once in a while , " but he added , " we can not keep everything squeaky clean .
that would be the same behavior as in the 1930s . "
eisenman previously said he did n't want the 2,700 steles to be treated with a special anti-graffiti-agent , maintaining that sprayers would find a way to paint on the stones if they really wanted to .
no bratwurst allowed but if graffiti is allowed , traditional german sausages are not .
eisenman said the most important thing for him is that no bratwurst stand is set up near the memorial when it opens to the public on may 8 , 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii .

military and humanitarian aid should be separate from one another , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces as protection for civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .

" we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .

after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend . after nearly a decade of discussion and several delays in the selection of a design , construction on berlin ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust is finally getting underway .
under the watchful eye of u.s. star architect peter eisenman , the first of a total 2,700 concrete steles will be selected and erected on a giant open square between the brandenburg gate and the city ’ s newly redeveloped potsdamer platz .
the presentation on saturday of the first group of gray concrete blocks , each measuring close to five meters in height and weighing several tons , is the first step towards completion of the mammoth monument in early 2005 .
having commissioned 10 differently-sized concrete slabs , the 71-year-old eisenman , who is regarded as one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture , is due to cast his eye over them before finally deciding which model will be duplicated in serial production .
starting in september the steles will be delivered to the site and slowly put in position .
after having dragged on for so long , first in the federal parliament , where politicians debated the very nature of constructing a physical memorial to the holocaust , and then in the architectural competition where experts took their time theorizing the question of what just such a monument should look like to the actual selection and financing of the project , the slow building process seems only fitting .
an undulating field of reflection the memorial itself is unlike any monument designed for berlin so far .
with the thousands of concrete steles lined up in rows across a 19,000-square-meter open area , it is slightly reminiscent of a graveyard .
" the place of no meaning , " as eisenman once referred to the site in the hopes of dispelling fears that he was trying to symbolize the death of the holocaust , however is intended as a confrontation with the past .
the visitor , who finds himself winding his way through the forest of steles , will be struck by how distant the busy city center seems , and how quiet and reflective – but not graveyard-like – the atmosphere is .
eisenman has said the design should give the impression of an " undulating field . "
there is no entrance or exit to the site ; no prescribed path way through the steles .
the uneven ground and the varying heigths of the steles are designed to create the sense of insecurity , but not overwhelming loss , eisenman has suggested .
the memorial will also include a subterranean information center at the edge of the site which will house a permanent exhibition dedicated to six million victims of the holocaust .
undaunted by graffiti risk despite the sensitivity of the project , eisenman has rejected having tight security around the memorial when it is opened .
set on one of berlin 's most prominent streets , close to the german capital 's central tiergarten park , some fear it could be an easy target for anti-semitic or attacks .
but eisenman wishes his monument to stay open for people to walk through whenever they want .
" like a prison or concentration camp , " eisenmann said the monument should survive attacks unscathed , as the steles are " all made out of concrete . "
he also said this week he would be unperturbed if the finished memorial became a target for graffiti artists .
in an interview with the german weekly news magazine stern , the architect acknowledged that " there are these destructive feelings once in a while , " but he added , " we can not keep everything squeaky clean .
that would be the same behavior as in the 1930s . "
eisenman previously said he did n't want the 2,700 steles to be treated with a special anti-graffiti-agent , maintaining that sprayers would find a way to paint on the stones if they really wanted to .
no bratwurst allowed but if graffiti is allowed , traditional german sausages are not .
eisenman said the most important thing for him is that no bratwurst stand is set up near the memorial when it opens to the public on may 8 , 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii .

after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend . after nearly a decade of discussion and several delays in the selection of a design , construction on berlin ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust is finally getting underway .
under the watchful eye of u.s. star architect peter eisenman , the first of a total 2,700 concrete steles will be selected and erected on a giant open square between the brandenburg gate and the city ’ s newly redeveloped potsdamer platz .
the presentation on saturday of the first group of gray concrete blocks , each measuring close to five meters in height and weighing several tons , is the first step towards completion of the mammoth monument in early 2005 .
having commissioned 10 differently-sized concrete slabs , the 71-year-old eisenman , who is regarded as one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture , is due to cast his eye over them before finally deciding which model will be duplicated in serial production .

military and humanitarian aid should be separate from one another , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces as protection for civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .

humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .
first the military enters , then the aid organizations follow up with their humanitarian assistance ; the two tasks can not be combined . nina werkhäuser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend . after nearly a decade of discussion and several delays in the selection of a design , construction on berlin ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust is finally getting underway .
under the watchful eye of u.s. star architect peter eisenman , the first of a total 2,700 concrete steles will be selected and erected on a giant open square between the brandenburg gate and the city ’ s newly redeveloped potsdamer platz .
the presentation on saturday of the first group of gray concrete blocks , each measuring close to five meters in height and weighing several tons , is the first step towards completion of the mammoth monument in early 2005 .
having commissioned 10 differently-sized concrete slabs , the 71-year-old eisenman , who is regarded as one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture , is due to cast his eye over them before finally deciding which model will be duplicated in serial production .
starting in september the steles will be delivered to the site and slowly put in position .
after having dragged on for so long , first in the federal parliament , where politicians debated the very nature of constructing a physical memorial to the holocaust , and then in the architectural competition where experts took their time theorizing the question of what just such a monument should look like to the actual selection and financing of the project , the slow building process seems only fitting .
an undulating field of reflection the memorial itself is unlike any monument designed for berlin so far .
with the thousands of concrete steles lined up in rows across a 19,000-square-meter open area , it is slightly reminiscent of a graveyard .
" the place of no meaning , " as eisenman once referred to the site in the hopes of dispelling fears that he was trying to symbolize the death of the holocaust , however is intended as a confrontation with the past .
the visitor , who finds himself winding his way through the forest of steles , will be struck by how distant the busy city center seems , and how quiet and reflective – but not graveyard-like – the atmosphere is .
eisenman has said the design should give the impression of an " undulating field . "
there is no entrance or exit to the site ; no prescribed path way through the steles .
the uneven ground and the varying heigths of the steles are designed to create the sense of insecurity , but not overwhelming loss , eisenman has suggested .
the memorial will also include a subterranean information center at the edge of the site which will house a permanent exhibition dedicated to six million victims of the holocaust .
undaunted by graffiti risk despite the sensitivity of the project , eisenman has rejected having tight security around the memorial when it is opened .
set on one of berlin 's most prominent streets , close to the german capital 's central tiergarten park , some fear it could be an easy target for anti-semitic or attacks .
but eisenman wishes his monument to stay open for people to walk through whenever they want .
" like a prison or concentration camp , " eisenmann said the monument should survive attacks unscathed , as the steles are " all made out of concrete . "
he also said this week he would be unperturbed if the finished memorial became a target for graffiti artists .
in an interview with the german weekly news magazine stern , the architect acknowledged that " there are these destructive feelings once in a while , " but he added , " we can not keep everything squeaky clean .
that would be the same behavior as in the 1930s . "
eisenman previously said he did n't want the 2,700 steles to be treated with a special anti-graffiti-agent , maintaining that sprayers would find a way to paint on the stones if they really wanted to .
no bratwurst allowed but if graffiti is allowed , traditional german sausages are not .
eisenman said the most important thing for him is that no bratwurst stand is set up near the memorial when it opens to the public on may 8 , 2005 , 60 years after the end of world war ii .

after years of delays , berlin 's controversial holocaust memorial designed by peter eisenman moves into a crucial phase this weekend . after nearly a decade of discussion and several delays in the selection of a design , construction on berlin ’ s memorial to the victims of the holocaust is finally getting underway .
under the watchful eye of u.s. star architect peter eisenman , the first of a total 2,700 concrete steles will be selected and erected on a giant open square between the brandenburg gate and the city ’ s newly redeveloped potsdamer platz .
the presentation on saturday of the first group of gray concrete blocks , each measuring close to five meters in height and weighing several tons , is the first step towards completion of the mammoth monument in early 2005 .
having commissioned 10 differently-sized concrete slabs , the 71-year-old eisenman , who is regarded as one of the most important forces in contemporary architecture , is due to cast his eye over them before finally deciding which model will be duplicated in serial production .
starting in september the steles will be delivered to the site and slowly put in position .
after having dragged on for so long , first in the federal parliament , where politicians debated the very nature of constructing a physical memorial to the holocaust , and then in the architectural competition where experts took their time theorizing the question of what just such a monument should look like to the actual selection and financing of the project , the slow building process seems only fitting .
an undulating field of reflection the memorial itself is unlike any monument designed for berlin so far .
with the thousands of concrete steles lined up in rows across a 19,000-square-meter open area , it is slightly reminiscent of a graveyard .
" the place of no meaning , " as eisenman once referred to the site in the hopes of dispelling fears that he was trying to symbolize the death of the holocaust , however is intended as a confrontation with the past .

military and humanitarian aid should be separate from one another , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces as protection for civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .

the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .
first the military enters , then the aid organizations follow up with their humanitarian assistance ; the two tasks can not be combined . nina werkhäuser send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it says that the transfers could devastate the south west coast if there was a major spill .
large tankers are mooring in the bay to receive crude oil brought by smaller tankers from the baltic for transport to the far east .
each operation involves up to two million barrels and takes about 10 to 14 days , with about six to eight smaller tankers loading a large vessel .
the oil is similar to that in the 1999 erika and 2002 prestige incidents , which caused widespread damage to the french and spanish coasts .
economic fears the bay has been used for transfers for some time , but these were mainly one-off operations of less persistent pollutants or in response to emergency situations .
the current transfers are being carried out for commercial reasons only .
if the area has to be used , it should be used wisely , with adequate counter pollution equipment on standby councillor stuart hughes there have been two transfers in the last two months .
the next transfer begins on monday august 18 after the mt iran hormoz arrives in the bay .
the council says a total release of cargo would affect the entire coast of the south west .
the effects to the economy would be devastating , having a similar impact to the foot-and-mouth outbreak , it says .
regulations governing the area are still in draft form after five years of discussion .
now the council is discussing its concerns with the government , the maritime and coastguard agency and the department of transport .
heritage site councillor stuart hughes , said : " we want to see better regulation of the area and for this to be strictly monitored to minimise the pollution risk .
" if the area has to be used , it should be used wisely , with a dedicated contingency plan for these operations and adequate counter pollution equipment on standby in the area to be deployed at a moment 's notice , as there would be if the operation was taking place in a british port .
" we think the current arrangements are insufficient . "
much of the devon coastline is already protected under world heritage site status .
it is the only natural heritage site on the british mainland to be recognised by unesco .
the county council has already called for urgent protection for devon 's coastline through the establishment of an internationally recognised particularly sensitive sea areas -lrb- pssa 's -rrb- .
in addition , the council has called for the devon coast to be recognised as a national marine environmental high risk area -lrb- mehra -rrb- .
this policy , recommended by lord donaldson 's inquiry following the braer disaster in 1993 , advises tankers and other potentially polluting vessels to avoid the area .
