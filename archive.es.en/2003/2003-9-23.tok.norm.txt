bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .
but since becoming bundesliga champion in 2002 , the club has fallen on hard times .
last year the team only managed third place and this season dortmund failed to qualify for the lucrative and prestigious champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . as the only bundesliga club listed on the stock exchange , losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
in an effort to help its finances , the club announced on monday that the players had agreed to take a 20 percent pay cut , should the team not bring in the necessary revenue by making it to the uefa cup and bundesliga finals . but the show of solidarity by the players is unlikely to deter eichel or his boss and known soccer fan chancellor gerhard schröder from revamping the rules for weekend shift tax allowances . “ the chancellor is in complete agreement with me that this situation is untenable , but that lower-income earners – for whom this law was originally meant – shouldn ’ t be penalized , ” said eichel . schröder ’ s government , strapped for cash itself these days , is extremely aware that germans will have little sympathy for millionaire soccer stars and their big-business clubs as towns and cities across the country are being forced to close swimming pools , fire policemen and cut back on services due to a shortage of tax revenues . outrage over " florida rolf " the drive to change the tax allowance rules for well-paid athletes comes on the heels of broad public outrage that the german social security system was paying welfare to some citizens that were living abroad .
one recipient in particular , a so-called “ florida rolf ” whose apartment in miami is paid for by german taxpayers , became a lighting rod for criticism over how social security is misused . after smelling blood over dortmund ’ s tax plans , eichel may be inclined to go after other sports that are even more flagrant in their creative use of germany ’ s welfare system .
ice hockey and basketball teams frequently allow their players to receive unemployment for the two to three months out of the year that there are no matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be on the dole ?
jürgen leister , a lawyer who represents the interests of sport professionals within the services trade union verdi , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the practice was also completely legal .
“ it does make me a little queasy , but that ’ s the law , ” he told the paper . even worse , although players often have only one-season contracts , many have already negotiated options for extending them for the following year .
leister said the players only needed to be reachable by the labor office while they were collecting dole payments that frequently total around € 3,000 a month . “ but when was the last time you heard of a pro getting a job via a placement center ? ”

with nato locked in internal strife , jaap de hoop scheffer of the netherlands is conflict-free choice as the new secretary general of the alliance . jaap de hoop scheffer , a christian democrat from the netherlands , was among the first to speak out in favor of the united states proceeding in the war against iraq without a united nations mandate .
though in contrast to his counterparts in spain , italy and britain he was barely audible in the cacophony of european voices , his " yes " went down well in washington . the lawyer , who is seen as a bit of a bore in his native holland consistently stresses the importance of europe in the alliance and the role it has to play in ensuring nato is equipped to deal with future issues .
the new candidate is also in favor of a particular military role , which pleases both the " old " and " new " europeans , as u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld dubbed those nations opposed to and in favor of the u.s. stance , respectively . clever mediator hoop scheffer 's political contemporaries speak highly of his outstanding ability to forge compromises and the skill with which he balances on diplomatic tightropes .
his one-time superior , the former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , which is currently a much needed quality back at nato headquarters .
gone is the cold war era when a nato leader could give off a mere growl to keep the warsaw pact in check .
these days the top diplomat needs a honed dove-like coo if he is to keep the illustrious 17 , soon to be 26 , member nations on course , and succeed at building the apparently necessary maze of bridges between the two sides of the atlantic . the u.s. , which is undoubtedly the greatest military might in the alliance , sees nato as a kind of toolbox to be used in the handling of missions such as that of international security troops in afghanistan .
on the other side of the coin there is europe which favors an independent military role , and the new alliance leader will have to negotiate between these two poles . a harmless leader overall , the relative ease with which jaap de hoop scheffer was elected to head up the alliance is an indication that the meaning of the transatlantic alliance is no longer such that london , paris , berlin or london felt it worth igniting a full-scale row over personnel issues . de hoop scheffer will harm no one , although france uttered some initial skepticism about the man who was reported to have an excellent relationship to u.s. president george w. bush .
that particular rumor seeped out into the world when , during an interview with the u.s. vice president dick cheney at the start of september , de hoop scheffer was spontaneously joined by the president himself as he coincidentally entered the room and sat down to join in .
paris was soon soothed into giving the dutch man a chance with news that de hoop scheffer is not only in favor of a strong europe , but also speaks fluent french , and even considers watching french movies one of his hobbies . back home in the netherlands , nato 's new leader 's own political party had refused to let him run as a candidate for prime minister on the grounds that his charisma was simply not up to the job .
but jan peter balkenende who ultimately led the christian democrats to election victory rewarded his political contemporary with the post of foreign minister . now both de hoop scheffer and the netherlands are being rewarded again , this time for remaining faithful to the u.s. , whose leaders evidently do n't count charisma as a prerequisite for the job . bernd riegert is deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch foreign minister slated to head nato career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term .

with nato locked in internal strife , jaap de hoop scheffer of the netherlands is conflict-free choice as the new secretary general of the alliance . jaap de hoop scheffer , a christian democrat from the netherlands , was among the first to speak out in favor of the united states proceeding in the war against iraq without a united nations mandate .
though in contrast to his counterparts in spain , italy and britain he was barely audible in the cacophony of european voices , his " yes " went down well in washington . the lawyer , who is seen as a bit of a bore in his native holland consistently stresses the importance of europe in the alliance and the role it has to play in ensuring nato is equipped to deal with future issues .
the new candidate is also in favor of a particular military role , which pleases both the " old " and " new " europeans , as u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld dubbed those nations opposed to and in favor of the u.s. stance , respectively . clever mediator hoop scheffer 's political contemporaries speak highly of his outstanding ability to forge compromises and the skill with which he balances on diplomatic tightropes .
his one-time superior , the former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , which is currently a much needed quality back at nato headquarters .
gone is the cold war era when a nato leader could give off a mere growl to keep the warsaw pact in check .
these days the top diplomat needs a honed dove-like coo if he is to keep the illustrious 17 , soon to be 26 , member nations on course , and succeed at building the apparently necessary maze of bridges between the two sides of the atlantic . the u.s. , which is undoubtedly the greatest military might in the alliance , sees nato as a kind of toolbox to be used in the handling of missions such as that of international security troops in afghanistan .
on the other side of the coin there is europe which favors an independent military role , and the new alliance leader will have to negotiate between these two poles . a harmless leader overall , the relative ease with which jaap de hoop scheffer was elected to head up the alliance is an indication that the meaning of the transatlantic alliance is no longer such that london , paris , berlin or london felt it worth igniting a full-scale row over personnel issues . de hoop scheffer will harm no one , although france uttered some initial skepticism about the man who was reported to have an excellent relationship to u.s. president george w. bush .
that particular rumor seeped out into the world when , during an interview with the u.s. vice president dick cheney at the start of september , de hoop scheffer was spontaneously joined by the president himself as he coincidentally entered the room and sat down to join in .
paris was soon soothed into giving the dutch man a chance with news that de hoop scheffer is not only in favor of a strong europe , but also speaks fluent french , and even considers watching french movies one of his hobbies . back home in the netherlands , nato 's new leader 's own political party had refused to let him run as a candidate for prime minister on the grounds that his charisma was simply not up to the job .
but jan peter balkenende who ultimately led the christian democrats to election victory rewarded his political contemporary with the post of foreign minister . now both de hoop scheffer and the netherlands are being rewarded again , this time for remaining faithful to the u.s. , whose leaders evidently do n't count charisma as a prerequisite for the job . bernd riegert is deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch foreign minister slated to head nato career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term .

it was the brainchild of herta heuwer , whose contribution to berlin 's culinary landscape was so highly regarded that a commemorative plaque was erected following her death in 1999 .
even the great pillar of fast food culture , the hamburger , is believed to have its roots in germany . in 1906 an entrepreneur and son of a german immigrant who went by the name of erich playowski , began serving small meatballs covered with melted cheese in white bread at his snack bar next to an ohio football field .
he named them after his home town of hamburg , and a legend was born .
the tradition evolves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from pizza to hamburgers , sushi to falafal , the fast food menu is growing all the time .
berlin alone boasts a massive 2,000 fast food stands with representatives from italy , china , japan , turkey , greece , the arab nations and northern africa . nonetheless , the supply never seems to be fully exhausted and , it seems , as long as foreigners continue to knock at germany 's door , berliners will continue to be wooed by a growing array of exotic and greasy taste sensations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bratwurst for the weekend , sir ?

chancellor schröder and president bush hope to put transatlantic relations back on track this week with their first one-on-one meeting in 16 months in new york .
but disagreements over iraq are likely to persist . german chancellor gerhard schröder is ostensibly traveling to new york to address the united nations general assembly and celebrate the 30th anniversary of german u.n. membership , but few observers doubt that the most important part of his three-day trip will be a 30 minute meeting with u.s. president george bush on wednesday . the encounter will be the first time the two leaders have held bilateral talks since they fell out over the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as one of the most vocal critics of the war , schröder has long been considered a persona non grata for bush . bush is said to have been not only angered by schröder ’ s decision to use anti-war rhetoric to boost his flagging reelection campaign last year , but also by comments from a later sacked german cabinet member that said bush was using foreign conflicts to distract from domestic problems just as adolph hitler did . thawing relations but there have been increasing signs of a thaw in german-american relations in recent weeks and the meeting in new york will underline that bush is perhaps ready to put his differences with schröder aside in order to improve ties between the two countries . in an interview with fox news on monday evening bush expressed understanding for germany ’ s anti-war position and the pacifism that grew out of the country ’ s experiences in world war ii .
he said he looked forward to “ substantive talks ” with schröder and also praised germany ’ s “ active role ” in afghanistan .
“ i appreciate this support , ” bush said . as the u.s. costs and casualties in postwar iraq continue to mount , bush has been compelled to return to the united nations in order to seek international help in stabilizing the country .
he is hoping the u.n. security council will agree to a new resolution that would encourage more nations to send peacekeepers . schröder , who is particularly keen to end the bad blood with the grudge-holding texan , is likely hoping to mediate between bush and other war opponents including french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
after talking with bush , schröder will meet with the french and russian leaders later on wednesday in new york . as schröder ’ s left berlin on monday , a german government official was at pains to say the trilateral summit was not an attempt to form renewed opposition to washington .
“ it ’ s definitely not signaling an opposing axis to the cooperation with the usa , ” the official told reporters being briefed on the chancellor ’ s trip .
“ germany certainly doesn ’ t see itself as an opposing pole to the united states . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and while hosting a three-way summit with france and britain in berlin over the weekend , schröder appeared to take the middle ground between chirac and staunch u.s. ally british prime minister tony blair . in an editorial published in the new york times on friday , schröder said germany was prepared to share the burden in iraq .
“ it is true that germany and the united states disagreed on how best to deal with saddam hussein 's regime .
there is no point in continuing this debate , ” schröder wrote .
“ we should now look toward the future .
we must work together to win the peace . ” pushing for a stronger u.n. role but schröder ’ s desire to make amends with bush doesn ’ t mean he will likely back away from german and french demands for a stronger role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq .
both countries are pushing for a speedy transition from u.s. occupation to iraqi sovereignty , but washington has so far dismissed a quick transfer of power as unrealistic . schröder has also made clear the united states can not expect berlin to send troops to help stabilize iraq , since the german bundeswehr is already pushed to the limit with thousands of soldiers on peacekeeping duty in afghanistan and elsewhere .
instead , berlin has offered to help train iraqi policemen and take part in other reconstruction projects . “ germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , ” schröder wrote in the new york times . after meeting bush , schröder will also address the u.n. general assembly in a 15 minute speech .
it will be the first speech from a german chancellor to the world body since willy brandt spoke in 1973 . besides reaffirming germany ’ s strong backing of the united nations and its belief in multilateralism to solve international conflicts , schröder is likely to propose revamping the u.n. security council to make it more relevant to the challenges of the 21st century .

chancellor schröder and president bush hope to put transatlantic relations back on track this week with their first one-on-one meeting in 16 months in new york .
but disagreements over iraq are likely to persist . german chancellor gerhard schröder is ostensibly traveling to new york to address the united nations general assembly and celebrate the 30th anniversary of german u.n. membership , but few observers doubt that the most important part of his three-day trip will be a 30 minute meeting with u.s. president george bush on wednesday . the encounter will be the first time the two leaders have held bilateral talks since they fell out over the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as one of the most vocal critics of the war , schröder has long been considered a persona non grata for bush . bush is said to have been not only angered by schröder ’ s decision to use anti-war rhetoric to boost his flagging reelection campaign last year , but also by comments from a later sacked german cabinet member that said bush was using foreign conflicts to distract from domestic problems just as adolph hitler did . thawing relations but there have been increasing signs of a thaw in german-american relations in recent weeks and the meeting in new york will underline that bush is perhaps ready to put his differences with schröder aside in order to improve ties between the two countries . in an interview with fox news on monday evening bush expressed understanding for germany ’ s anti-war position and the pacifism that grew out of the country ’ s experiences in world war ii .
he said he looked forward to “ substantive talks ” with schröder and also praised germany ’ s “ active role ” in afghanistan .
“ i appreciate this support , ” bush said . as the u.s. costs and casualties in postwar iraq continue to mount , bush has been compelled to return to the united nations in order to seek international help in stabilizing the country .
he is hoping the u.n. security council will agree to a new resolution that would encourage more nations to send peacekeepers . schröder , who is particularly keen to end the bad blood with the grudge-holding texan , is likely hoping to mediate between bush and other war opponents including french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
after talking with bush , schröder will meet with the french and russian leaders later on wednesday in new york . as schröder ’ s left berlin on monday , a german government official was at pains to say the trilateral summit was not an attempt to form renewed opposition to washington .
“ it ’ s definitely not signaling an opposing axis to the cooperation with the usa , ” the official told reporters being briefed on the chancellor ’ s trip .
“ germany certainly doesn ’ t see itself as an opposing pole to the united states . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and while hosting a three-way summit with france and britain in berlin over the weekend , schröder appeared to take the middle ground between chirac and staunch u.s. ally british prime minister tony blair . in an editorial published in the new york times on friday , schröder said germany was prepared to share the burden in iraq .
“ it is true that germany and the united states disagreed on how best to deal with saddam hussein 's regime .
there is no point in continuing this debate , ” schröder wrote .
“ we should now look toward the future .
we must work together to win the peace . ” pushing for a stronger u.n. role but schröder ’ s desire to make amends with bush doesn ’ t mean he will likely back away from german and french demands for a stronger role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq .
both countries are pushing for a speedy transition from u.s. occupation to iraqi sovereignty , but washington has so far dismissed a quick transfer of power as unrealistic . schröder has also made clear the united states can not expect berlin to send troops to help stabilize iraq , since the german bundeswehr is already pushed to the limit with thousands of soldiers on peacekeeping duty in afghanistan and elsewhere .
instead , berlin has offered to help train iraqi policemen and take part in other reconstruction projects . “ germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , ” schröder wrote in the new york times . after meeting bush , schröder will also address the u.n. general assembly in a 15 minute speech .
it will be the first speech from a german chancellor to the world body since willy brandt spoke in 1973 . besides reaffirming germany ’ s strong backing of the united nations and its belief in multilateralism to solve international conflicts , schröder is likely to propose revamping the u.n. security council to make it more relevant to the challenges of the 21st century .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 23.09.2003 a david vs. goliath fight over proposed software patent rules großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : linux creator linus torvalds says new eu patent rules endanger open-source software .
a controversial software patent directive up for a vote in the european parliament has stirred up intense debate .
critics claim the ruling would stifle innovation and put smaller software companies out of business . a vote on the proposed guidelines , called the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions , has already been delayed twice due to impassioned protests by backers of open-source software .
they say passage of the regulation would have dire consequences for newcomers in the market and developers of free software products .
the draft directive , which has been through 120 amendments , is being debated on tuesday in the parliament and is expected to come to a vote on wednesday .
in most eu countries , software is treated in the same way as the written word and receives copyright protection .
the new guidelines seek to introduce patenting and its proponents say it will harmonize laws that currently differ across eu states .
but critics have lashed out at the proposal , saying it only benefits larger companies and is a job killer .
smaller companies , which are often the most innovative , will suffer the most , according to jeremy newton of the law firm nabarro nathanson .
“ to go out and seek patent protection is costly and very demanding .
small companies will say , ‘ we can ’ t afford this protection . ’
that is a fact of life , ” he told vnunet.com , a technology news website .
two of the world ’ s most renowned figures in the open-source community , linus torvalds and alan cox , have written an open letter to the european parliament urging it to reject the proposal .
“ unlike traditional patents , software patents do not encourage innovation and r & d. quite the contrary , ” they wrote .
torvalds invented the linux basic core and cox is one of the most influential linux developers .
linux is a operating system similar to microsoft windows , whose source code is available to everyone free of charge .
it has become a formidable force in the software industry , but software patents could threaten its open-source development model .
a clearer framework the british mep who introduced the directive last year , arlene mccarthy , defended the proposed guidelines on tuesday in strasbourg , seat of the european parliament , saying it would help protect scientists and companies against competition from american software firms and make the legal framework around computer-related patents more consistent and understandable .
the german federation of information , telecommunication and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- has come out in support of the proposed rules , arguing smaller firms will benefit by protecting their inventions with patents .
“ innovation costs time and effort .
a patent will enable companies to regain some of that investment , ” susanne schopf , head of bitkom ’ s legal protection department , told german television .
according to the directive ’ s backers , more than 20,000 computer-related patents have already been issued on software developments in the eu .
they say the 120 amendments that have made to the draft guidelines since its introduction ensure that only inventions that represent significant technical developments are eligible for patents .
“ u.s.-style mess ” critics such as torvalds and cox , however , say the directive is worded in such a way that virtually any software or electronic business process could be patented , which is already the case in the u.s.
“ in principle we are in favor of harmonisation , but not so that it goes into a u.s.-style mess , ” john holden , senior research analyst at butler group , told vnunet.com.
but he added that patent legislation has not stopped innovation in the u.s. computer scientists , software developers and representatives of small and medium-sized companies across the eu have expressed concern over the proposed change in the law .
last month , a group of 12 leading economists also urged the european parliament to reject the directive , warning that it could produce “ extensive portfolios of software patents ” that favor large corporations . “ while some small and medium-sized firms will be able to prosper in this environment , many will not , ” the letter said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de linux penguins invade germany in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system .

a controversial software patent directive up for a vote in the european parliament has stirred up intense debate .
critics claim the ruling would stifle innovation and put smaller software companies out of business . a vote on the proposed guidelines , called the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions , has already been delayed twice due to impassioned protests by backers of open-source software .
they say passage of the regulation would have dire consequences for newcomers in the market and developers of free software products .
the draft directive , which has been through 120 amendments , is being debated on tuesday in the parliament and is expected to come to a vote on wednesday .
in most eu countries , software is treated in the same way as the written word and receives copyright protection .
the new guidelines seek to introduce patenting and its proponents say it will harmonize laws that currently differ across eu states .
but critics have lashed out at the proposal , saying it only benefits larger companies and is a job killer .
smaller companies , which are often the most innovative , will suffer the most , according to jeremy newton of the law firm nabarro nathanson .
“ to go out and seek patent protection is costly and very demanding .
small companies will say , ‘ we can ’ t afford this protection . ’
that is a fact of life , ” he told vnunet.com , a technology news website .
two of the world ’ s most renowned figures in the open-source community , linus torvalds and alan cox , have written an open letter to the european parliament urging it to reject the proposal .
“ unlike traditional patents , software patents do not encourage innovation and r & d. quite the contrary , ” they wrote .
torvalds invented the linux basic core and cox is one of the most influential linux developers .
linux is a operating system similar to microsoft windows , whose source code is available to everyone free of charge .
it has become a formidable force in the software industry , but software patents could threaten its open-source development model .
a clearer framework the british mep who introduced the directive last year , arlene mccarthy , defended the proposed guidelines on tuesday in strasbourg , seat of the european parliament , saying it would help protect scientists and companies against competition from american software firms and make the legal framework around computer-related patents more consistent and understandable .
the german federation of information , telecommunication and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- has come out in support of the proposed rules , arguing smaller firms will benefit by protecting their inventions with patents .
“ innovation costs time and effort .
a patent will enable companies to regain some of that investment , ” susanne schopf , head of bitkom ’ s legal protection department , told german television .
according to the directive ’ s backers , more than 20,000 computer-related patents have already been issued on software developments in the eu .
they say the 120 amendments that have made to the draft guidelines since its introduction ensure that only inventions that represent significant technical developments are eligible for patents .
“ u.s.-style mess ” critics such as torvalds and cox , however , say the directive is worded in such a way that virtually any software or electronic business process could be patented , which is already the case in the u.s.
“ in principle we are in favor of harmonisation , but not so that it goes into a u.s.-style mess , ” john holden , senior research analyst at butler group , told vnunet.com.
but he added that patent legislation has not stopped innovation in the u.s. computer scientists , software developers and representatives of small and medium-sized companies across the eu have expressed concern over the proposed change in the law .
last month , a group of 12 leading economists also urged the european parliament to reject the directive , warning that it could produce “ extensive portfolios of software patents ” that favor large corporations . “ while some small and medium-sized firms will be able to prosper in this environment , many will not , ” the letter said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de linux penguins invade germany in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .
but since becoming bundesliga champion in 2002 , the club has fallen on hard times .
last year the team only managed third place and this season dortmund failed to qualify for the lucrative and prestigious champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . as the only bundesliga club listed on the stock exchange , losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
in an effort to help its finances , the club announced on monday that the players had agreed to take a 20 percent pay cut , should the team not bring in the necessary revenue by making it to the uefa cup and bundesliga finals . but the show of solidarity by the players is unlikely to deter eichel or his boss and known soccer fan chancellor gerhard schröder from revamping the rules for weekend shift tax allowances . “ the chancellor is in complete agreement with me that this situation is untenable , but that lower-income earners – for whom this law was originally meant – shouldn ’ t be penalized , ” said eichel . schröder ’ s government , strapped for cash itself these days , is extremely aware that germans will have little sympathy for millionaire soccer stars and their big-business clubs as towns and cities across the country are being forced to close swimming pools , fire policemen and cut back on services due to a shortage of tax revenues . outrage over " florida rolf " the drive to change the tax allowance rules for well-paid athletes comes on the heels of broad public outrage that the german social security system was paying welfare to some citizens that were living abroad .
one recipient in particular , a so-called “ florida rolf ” whose apartment in miami is paid for by german taxpayers , became a lighting rod for criticism over how social security is misused . after smelling blood over dortmund ’ s tax plans , eichel may be inclined to go after other sports that are even more flagrant in their creative use of germany ’ s welfare system .
ice hockey and basketball teams frequently allow their players to receive unemployment for the two to three months out of the year that there are no matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be on the dole ?
jürgen leister , a lawyer who represents the interests of sport professionals within the services trade union verdi , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the practice was also completely legal .
“ it does make me a little queasy , but that ’ s the law , ” he told the paper . even worse , although players often have only one-season contracts , many have already negotiated options for extending them for the following year .
leister said the players only needed to be reachable by the labor office while they were collecting dole payments that frequently total around € 3,000 a month . “ but when was the last time you heard of a pro getting a job via a placement center ? ”

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .
but since becoming bundesliga champion in 2002 , the club has fallen on hard times .
last year the team only managed third place and this season dortmund failed to qualify for the lucrative and prestigious champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . as the only bundesliga club listed on the stock exchange , losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
in an effort to help its finances , the club announced on monday that the players had agreed to take a 20 percent pay cut , should the team not bring in the necessary revenue by making it to the uefa cup and bundesliga finals . but the show of solidarity by the players is unlikely to deter eichel or his boss and known soccer fan chancellor gerhard schröder from revamping the rules for weekend shift tax allowances . “ the chancellor is in complete agreement with me that this situation is untenable , but that lower-income earners – for whom this law was originally meant – shouldn ’ t be penalized , ” said eichel . schröder ’ s government , strapped for cash itself these days , is extremely aware that germans will have little sympathy for millionaire soccer stars and their big-business clubs as towns and cities across the country are being forced to close swimming pools , fire policemen and cut back on services due to a shortage of tax revenues . outrage over " florida rolf " the drive to change the tax allowance rules for well-paid athletes comes on the heels of broad public outrage that the german social security system was paying welfare to some citizens that were living abroad .

wolfgang schäuble and friedrich merz were also reelected as the group 's deputy chairmen , despite confusion over whether merz would again stand for the post .
he had suggested he would not run because he was vehemently opposed to the health system reforms agreed on between the government and his party .
after a night of discussion with merkel , merz finally agreed to run for reelection and to support the compromise on the reforms in a parliamentary vote on friday .
tuesday 's vote within the parliamentary group is seen as an indicator of politicians ' strength .

now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .
but since becoming bundesliga champion in 2002 , the club has fallen on hard times .
last year the team only managed third place and this season dortmund failed to qualify for the lucrative and prestigious champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . as the only bundesliga club listed on the stock exchange , losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
in an effort to help its finances , the club announced on monday that the players had agreed to take a 20 percent pay cut , should the team not bring in the necessary revenue by making it to the uefa cup and bundesliga finals . but the show of solidarity by the players is unlikely to deter eichel or his boss and known soccer fan chancellor gerhard schröder from revamping the rules for weekend shift tax allowances . “ the chancellor is in complete agreement with me that this situation is untenable , but that lower-income earners – for whom this law was originally meant – shouldn ’ t be penalized , ” said eichel . schröder ’ s government , strapped for cash itself these days , is extremely aware that germans will have little sympathy for millionaire soccer stars and their big-business clubs as towns and cities across the country are being forced to close swimming pools , fire policemen and cut back on services due to a shortage of tax revenues . outrage over " florida rolf " the drive to change the tax allowance rules for well-paid athletes comes on the heels of broad public outrage that the german social security system was paying welfare to some citizens that were living abroad .
one recipient in particular , a so-called “ florida rolf ” whose apartment in miami is paid for by german taxpayers , became a lighting rod for criticism over how social security is misused . after smelling blood over dortmund ’ s tax plans , eichel may be inclined to go after other sports that are even more flagrant in their creative use of germany ’ s welfare system .
ice hockey and basketball teams frequently allow their players to receive unemployment for the two to three months out of the year that there are no matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be on the dole ?
jürgen leister , a lawyer who represents the interests of sport professionals within the services trade union verdi , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the practice was also completely legal .
“ it does make me a little queasy , but that ’ s the law , ” he told the paper . even worse , although players often have only one-season contracts , many have already negotiated options for extending them for the following year .
leister said the players only needed to be reachable by the labor office while they were collecting dole payments that frequently total around € 3,000 a month . “ but when was the last time you heard of a pro getting a job via a placement center ? ”

with nato locked in internal strife , jaap de hoop scheffer of the netherlands is conflict-free choice as the new secretary general of the alliance . jaap de hoop scheffer , a christian democrat from the netherlands , was among the first to speak out in favor of the united states proceeding in the war against iraq without a united nations mandate .
though in contrast to his counterparts in spain , italy and britain he was barely audible in the cacophony of european voices , his " yes " went down well in washington . the lawyer , who is seen as a bit of a bore in his native holland consistently stresses the importance of europe in the alliance and the role it has to play in ensuring nato is equipped to deal with future issues .
the new candidate is also in favor of a particular military role , which pleases both the " old " and " new " europeans , as u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld dubbed those nations opposed to and in favor of the u.s. stance , respectively . clever mediator hoop scheffer 's political contemporaries speak highly of his outstanding ability to forge compromises and the skill with which he balances on diplomatic tightropes .
his one-time superior , the former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , which is currently a much needed quality back at nato headquarters .
gone is the cold war era when a nato leader could give off a mere growl to keep the warsaw pact in check .
these days the top diplomat needs a honed dove-like coo if he is to keep the illustrious 17 , soon to be 26 , member nations on course , and succeed at building the apparently necessary maze of bridges between the two sides of the atlantic . the u.s. , which is undoubtedly the greatest military might in the alliance , sees nato as a kind of toolbox to be used in the handling of missions such as that of international security troops in afghanistan .
on the other side of the coin there is europe which favors an independent military role , and the new alliance leader will have to negotiate between these two poles . a harmless leader overall , the relative ease with which jaap de hoop scheffer was elected to head up the alliance is an indication that the meaning of the transatlantic alliance is no longer such that london , paris , berlin or london felt it worth igniting a full-scale row over personnel issues . de hoop scheffer will harm no one , although france uttered some initial skepticism about the man who was reported to have an excellent relationship to u.s. president george w. bush .
that particular rumor seeped out into the world when , during an interview with the u.s. vice president dick cheney at the start of september , de hoop scheffer was spontaneously joined by the president himself as he coincidentally entered the room and sat down to join in .
paris was soon soothed into giving the dutch man a chance with news that de hoop scheffer is not only in favor of a strong europe , but also speaks fluent french , and even considers watching french movies one of his hobbies . back home in the netherlands , nato 's new leader 's own political party had refused to let him run as a candidate for prime minister on the grounds that his charisma was simply not up to the job .
but jan peter balkenende who ultimately led the christian democrats to election victory rewarded his political contemporary with the post of foreign minister . now both de hoop scheffer and the netherlands are being rewarded again , this time for remaining faithful to the u.s. , whose leaders evidently do n't count charisma as a prerequisite for the job . bernd riegert is deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch foreign minister slated to head nato career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term .

the € 225 million -lrb- $ 258 million -rrb- , frozen in foreign bank accounts for over a decade , stemmed from the east german state 's foreign trade company novum .
the long-running legal dispute was settled when the berlin court decided the firm , which mainly worked with austrian companies , belonged to the former east german communist party , the sed , and not the austrian communist party -lrb- kpo -rrb- .
a previous court decision had determined novum belonged to the kpo .
german law says that assets earned illegally by the sed - which now includes novum 's fortune - should be used for nonprofit purposes to benefit eastern germany . more briefs 23.09.2003 -pipe- convicted 9/11 terrorist reiterates innocence 22.09.2003 -pipe- germany set for eu budget refund 22.09.2003 -pipe- germany to take part in iraq donor conference 22.09.2003 -pipe- police arrest dresden bomb suspect 22.09.2003 -pipe- germans wins elephant polo tournament 22.09.2003 -pipe- goethe institute opens doors in kabul 19.09.2003 -pipe- campaign to boost eu awareness 19.09.2003 -pipe- increase in children born to foreign parents radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

chancellor schröder and president bush hope to put transatlantic relations back on track this week with their first one-on-one meeting in 16 months in new york .
but disagreements over iraq are likely to persist . german chancellor gerhard schröder is ostensibly traveling to new york to address the united nations general assembly and celebrate the 30th anniversary of german u.n. membership , but few observers doubt that the most important part of his three-day trip will be a 30 minute meeting with u.s. president george bush on wednesday . the encounter will be the first time the two leaders have held bilateral talks since they fell out over the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as one of the most vocal critics of the war , schröder has long been considered a persona non grata for bush . bush is said to have been not only angered by schröder ’ s decision to use anti-war rhetoric to boost his flagging reelection campaign last year , but also by comments from a later sacked german cabinet member that said bush was using foreign conflicts to distract from domestic problems just as adolph hitler did . thawing relations but there have been increasing signs of a thaw in german-american relations in recent weeks and the meeting in new york will underline that bush is perhaps ready to put his differences with schröder aside in order to improve ties between the two countries . in an interview with fox news on monday evening bush expressed understanding for germany ’ s anti-war position and the pacifism that grew out of the country ’ s experiences in world war ii .
he said he looked forward to “ substantive talks ” with schröder and also praised germany ’ s “ active role ” in afghanistan .
“ i appreciate this support , ” bush said . as the u.s. costs and casualties in postwar iraq continue to mount , bush has been compelled to return to the united nations in order to seek international help in stabilizing the country .
he is hoping the u.n. security council will agree to a new resolution that would encourage more nations to send peacekeepers . schröder , who is particularly keen to end the bad blood with the grudge-holding texan , is likely hoping to mediate between bush and other war opponents including french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
after talking with bush , schröder will meet with the french and russian leaders later on wednesday in new york . as schröder ’ s left berlin on monday , a german government official was at pains to say the trilateral summit was not an attempt to form renewed opposition to washington .
“ it ’ s definitely not signaling an opposing axis to the cooperation with the usa , ” the official told reporters being briefed on the chancellor ’ s trip .
“ germany certainly doesn ’ t see itself as an opposing pole to the united states . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and while hosting a three-way summit with france and britain in berlin over the weekend , schröder appeared to take the middle ground between chirac and staunch u.s. ally british prime minister tony blair . in an editorial published in the new york times on friday , schröder said germany was prepared to share the burden in iraq .
“ it is true that germany and the united states disagreed on how best to deal with saddam hussein 's regime .
there is no point in continuing this debate , ” schröder wrote .
“ we should now look toward the future .
we must work together to win the peace . ” pushing for a stronger u.n. role but schröder ’ s desire to make amends with bush doesn ’ t mean he will likely back away from german and french demands for a stronger role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq .
both countries are pushing for a speedy transition from u.s. occupation to iraqi sovereignty , but washington has so far dismissed a quick transfer of power as unrealistic . schröder has also made clear the united states can not expect berlin to send troops to help stabilize iraq , since the german bundeswehr is already pushed to the limit with thousands of soldiers on peacekeeping duty in afghanistan and elsewhere .
instead , berlin has offered to help train iraqi policemen and take part in other reconstruction projects . “ germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , ” schröder wrote in the new york times . after meeting bush , schröder will also address the u.n. general assembly in a 15 minute speech .
it will be the first speech from a german chancellor to the world body since willy brandt spoke in 1973 . besides reaffirming germany ’ s strong backing of the united nations and its belief in multilateralism to solve international conflicts , schröder is likely to propose revamping the u.n. security council to make it more relevant to the challenges of the 21st century .

chancellor schröder and president bush hope to put transatlantic relations back on track this week with their first one-on-one meeting in 16 months in new york .
but disagreements over iraq are likely to persist . german chancellor gerhard schröder is ostensibly traveling to new york to address the united nations general assembly and celebrate the 30th anniversary of german u.n. membership , but few observers doubt that the most important part of his three-day trip will be a 30 minute meeting with u.s. president george bush on wednesday . the encounter will be the first time the two leaders have held bilateral talks since they fell out over the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as one of the most vocal critics of the war , schröder has long been considered a persona non grata for bush . bush is said to have been not only angered by schröder ’ s decision to use anti-war rhetoric to boost his flagging reelection campaign last year , but also by comments from a later sacked german cabinet member that said bush was using foreign conflicts to distract from domestic problems just as adolph hitler did . thawing relations but there have been increasing signs of a thaw in german-american relations in recent weeks and the meeting in new york will underline that bush is perhaps ready to put his differences with schröder aside in order to improve ties between the two countries . in an interview with fox news on monday evening bush expressed understanding for germany ’ s anti-war position and the pacifism that grew out of the country ’ s experiences in world war ii .
he said he looked forward to “ substantive talks ” with schröder and also praised germany ’ s “ active role ” in afghanistan .
“ i appreciate this support , ” bush said . as the u.s. costs and casualties in postwar iraq continue to mount , bush has been compelled to return to the united nations in order to seek international help in stabilizing the country .
he is hoping the u.n. security council will agree to a new resolution that would encourage more nations to send peacekeepers . schröder , who is particularly keen to end the bad blood with the grudge-holding texan , is likely hoping to mediate between bush and other war opponents including french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
after talking with bush , schröder will meet with the french and russian leaders later on wednesday in new york . as schröder ’ s left berlin on monday , a german government official was at pains to say the trilateral summit was not an attempt to form renewed opposition to washington .
“ it ’ s definitely not signaling an opposing axis to the cooperation with the usa , ” the official told reporters being briefed on the chancellor ’ s trip .
“ germany certainly doesn ’ t see itself as an opposing pole to the united states . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and while hosting a three-way summit with france and britain in berlin over the weekend , schröder appeared to take the middle ground between chirac and staunch u.s. ally british prime minister tony blair . in an editorial published in the new york times on friday , schröder said germany was prepared to share the burden in iraq .
“ it is true that germany and the united states disagreed on how best to deal with saddam hussein 's regime .
there is no point in continuing this debate , ” schröder wrote .
“ we should now look toward the future .
we must work together to win the peace . ” pushing for a stronger u.n. role but schröder ’ s desire to make amends with bush doesn ’ t mean he will likely back away from german and french demands for a stronger role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq .
both countries are pushing for a speedy transition from u.s. occupation to iraqi sovereignty , but washington has so far dismissed a quick transfer of power as unrealistic . schröder has also made clear the united states can not expect berlin to send troops to help stabilize iraq , since the german bundeswehr is already pushed to the limit with thousands of soldiers on peacekeeping duty in afghanistan and elsewhere .
instead , berlin has offered to help train iraqi policemen and take part in other reconstruction projects . “ germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , ” schröder wrote in the new york times . after meeting bush , schröder will also address the u.n. general assembly in a 15 minute speech .
it will be the first speech from a german chancellor to the world body since willy brandt spoke in 1973 . besides reaffirming germany ’ s strong backing of the united nations and its belief in multilateralism to solve international conflicts , schröder is likely to propose revamping the u.n. security council to make it more relevant to the challenges of the 21st century .
such changes could include berlin ’ s goal of attaining a permanent german seat on the council . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin summit scores high for attempt at compromise despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise .

a controversial software patent directive up for a vote in the european parliament has stirred up intense debate .
critics claim the ruling would stifle innovation and put smaller software companies out of business . a vote on the proposed guidelines , called the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions , has already been delayed twice due to impassioned protests by backers of open-source software .
they say passage of the regulation would have dire consequences for newcomers in the market and developers of free software products .
the draft directive , which has been through 120 amendments , is being debated on tuesday in the parliament and is expected to come to a vote on wednesday .
in most eu countries , software is treated in the same way as the written word and receives copyright protection .
the new guidelines seek to introduce patenting and its proponents say it will harmonize laws that currently differ across eu states .
but critics have lashed out at the proposal , saying it only benefits larger companies and is a job killer .
smaller companies , which are often the most innovative , will suffer the most , according to jeremy newton of the law firm nabarro nathanson .
“ to go out and seek patent protection is costly and very demanding .
small companies will say , ‘ we can ’ t afford this protection . ’
that is a fact of life , ” he told vnunet.com , a technology news website .
two of the world ’ s most renowned figures in the open-source community , linus torvalds and alan cox , have written an open letter to the european parliament urging it to reject the proposal .
“ unlike traditional patents , software patents do not encourage innovation and r & d. quite the contrary , ” they wrote .
torvalds invented the linux basic core and cox is one of the most influential linux developers .
linux is a operating system similar to microsoft windows , whose source code is available to everyone free of charge .
it has become a formidable force in the software industry , but software patents could threaten its open-source development model .
a clearer framework the british mep who introduced the directive last year , arlene mccarthy , defended the proposed guidelines on tuesday in strasbourg , seat of the european parliament , saying it would help protect scientists and companies against competition from american software firms and make the legal framework around computer-related patents more consistent and understandable .
the german federation of information , telecommunication and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- has come out in support of the proposed rules , arguing smaller firms will benefit by protecting their inventions with patents .
“ innovation costs time and effort .
a patent will enable companies to regain some of that investment , ” susanne schopf , head of bitkom ’ s legal protection department , told german television .
according to the directive ’ s backers , more than 20,000 computer-related patents have already been issued on software developments in the eu .
they say the 120 amendments that have made to the draft guidelines since its introduction ensure that only inventions that represent significant technical developments are eligible for patents .
“ u.s.-style mess ” critics such as torvalds and cox , however , say the directive is worded in such a way that virtually any software or electronic business process could be patented , which is already the case in the u.s.
“ in principle we are in favor of harmonisation , but not so that it goes into a u.s.-style mess , ” john holden , senior research analyst at butler group , told vnunet.com.
but he added that patent legislation has not stopped innovation in the u.s. computer scientists , software developers and representatives of small and medium-sized companies across the eu have expressed concern over the proposed change in the law .
last month , a group of 12 leading economists also urged the european parliament to reject the directive , warning that it could produce “ extensive portfolios of software patents ” that favor large corporations . “ while some small and medium-sized firms will be able to prosper in this environment , many will not , ” the letter said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de linux penguins invade germany in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system .

chancellor schröder and president bush hope to put transatlantic relations back on track this week with their first one-on-one meeting in 16 months in new york .
but disagreements over iraq are likely to persist . german chancellor gerhard schröder is ostensibly traveling to new york to address the united nations general assembly and celebrate the 30th anniversary of german u.n. membership , but few observers doubt that the most important part of his three-day trip will be a 30 minute meeting with u.s. president george bush on wednesday . the encounter will be the first time the two leaders have held bilateral talks since they fell out over the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as one of the most vocal critics of the war , schröder has long been considered a persona non grata for bush . bush is said to have been not only angered by schröder ’ s decision to use anti-war rhetoric to boost his flagging reelection campaign last year , but also by comments from a later sacked german cabinet member that said bush was using foreign conflicts to distract from domestic problems just as adolph hitler did . thawing relations but there have been increasing signs of a thaw in german-american relations in recent weeks and the meeting in new york will underline that bush is perhaps ready to put his differences with schröder aside in order to improve ties between the two countries . in an interview with fox news on monday evening bush expressed understanding for germany ’ s anti-war position and the pacifism that grew out of the country ’ s experiences in world war ii .
he said he looked forward to “ substantive talks ” with schröder and also praised germany ’ s “ active role ” in afghanistan .
“ i appreciate this support , ” bush said . as the u.s. costs and casualties in postwar iraq continue to mount , bush has been compelled to return to the united nations in order to seek international help in stabilizing the country .
he is hoping the u.n. security council will agree to a new resolution that would encourage more nations to send peacekeepers . schröder , who is particularly keen to end the bad blood with the grudge-holding texan , is likely hoping to mediate between bush and other war opponents including french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
after talking with bush , schröder will meet with the french and russian leaders later on wednesday in new york . as schröder ’ s left berlin on monday , a german government official was at pains to say the trilateral summit was not an attempt to form renewed opposition to washington .
“ it ’ s definitely not signaling an opposing axis to the cooperation with the usa , ” the official told reporters being briefed on the chancellor ’ s trip .
“ germany certainly doesn ’ t see itself as an opposing pole to the united states . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and while hosting a three-way summit with france and britain in berlin over the weekend , schröder appeared to take the middle ground between chirac and staunch u.s. ally british prime minister tony blair . in an editorial published in the new york times on friday , schröder said germany was prepared to share the burden in iraq .
“ it is true that germany and the united states disagreed on how best to deal with saddam hussein 's regime .
there is no point in continuing this debate , ” schröder wrote .
“ we should now look toward the future .
we must work together to win the peace . ” pushing for a stronger u.n. role but schröder ’ s desire to make amends with bush doesn ’ t mean he will likely back away from german and french demands for a stronger role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq .
both countries are pushing for a speedy transition from u.s. occupation to iraqi sovereignty , but washington has so far dismissed a quick transfer of power as unrealistic . schröder has also made clear the united states can not expect berlin to send troops to help stabilize iraq , since the german bundeswehr is already pushed to the limit with thousands of soldiers on peacekeeping duty in afghanistan and elsewhere .
instead , berlin has offered to help train iraqi policemen and take part in other reconstruction projects . “ germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , ” schröder wrote in the new york times . after meeting bush , schröder will also address the u.n. general assembly in a 15 minute speech .
it will be the first speech from a german chancellor to the world body since willy brandt spoke in 1973 . besides reaffirming germany ’ s strong backing of the united nations and its belief in multilateralism to solve international conflicts , schröder is likely to propose revamping the u.n. security council to make it more relevant to the challenges of the 21st century .

it will be the first speech from a german chancellor to the world body since willy brandt spoke in 1973 . besides reaffirming germany ’ s strong backing of the united nations and its belief in multilateralism to solve international conflicts , schröder is likely to propose revamping the u.n. security council to make it more relevant to the challenges of the 21st century .
such changes could include berlin ’ s goal of attaining a permanent german seat on the council . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin summit scores high for attempt at compromise despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise .

as the modern world continues its saucy and long-standing love affair with fast food , a berlin museum has whipped together a feast of alimentary icons in an exhibition which explores the social phenomenon of junk food . be it standing , moving , on the go or in between meals , we all eat fast food - even german chancellor gerhard schröder .
be it in helsinki , st. petersberg or closer to home in paderborn , people are addicted to fast food , a panacea for spontaneous cravings .
welcome to the microcosmo of plastic packaging , plastic forks and deep-frozen foods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new exhibition at the domäne dahlem museum in berlin seeks to shed new light on the social phenomenon of fast food . it 's an elemental experience for junk food junkies and provides the chance for them to get their biggest fix yet .
room upon room of exhibits paint the bigger picture of the sometimes delicious , sometimes depressing world of the universal snack bar .
from french fries to pizza " imbissbuden - essen ohne grenzen " -lrb- snack bars - food without frontiers -rrb- is a cooperation between the museum and publicist jon von wetzlar which seeks to explore the architectonic , culinary and sociological effects of these urban anarchists on their surroundings .
with photos , videos , paintings , visuals , sound installations , light effects and even smell sensations , the exhibition , like most snack bars , has something for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an array of items contributed to the show by artist patricia waller include crocheted french fries , hamburgers and pizza slices that have proven especially popular with the show 's younger visitors . the walls are lined with photographs depicting the kitchy uniqueness of dozens of snack bars discovered by von wetzlar during a research odyssey around the outskirts of berlin .
the images , which include joints with glaringly green artificial lawns and compulsory high tables , were shot by photographer christoph buckstegen , have been compiled in a book entitled urban anarchisten - die kultur der imbissbude -lrb- urban anarchists - the culture of the snack bar -rrb- .
modest beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the show 's curators , berlin got its first taste of fast food some 200 years ago when a pioneering foodie opened a cinnamon pretzel stand in the city 's spandau district .
it was then 120 years later that the popular bockwurst sausage made its first fast food appearance , followed by a berlin creation that is still a firm favorite .
the berliner currywurst , sausage smothered in sauce , is like a large frankfurter sausage cut into pieces then doused in tomato ketchup and sprinkled with a generous helping of curry powder .
it was the brainchild of herta heuwer , whose contribution to berlin 's culinary landscape was so highly regarded that a commemorative plaque was erected following her death in 1999 .
even the great pillar of fast food culture , the hamburger , is believed to have its roots in germany . in 1906 an entrepreneur and son of a german immigrant who went by the name of erich playowski , began serving small meatballs covered with melted cheese in white bread at his snack bar next to an ohio football field .
he named them after his home town of hamburg , and a legend was born .
the tradition evolves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from pizza to hamburgers , sushi to falafal , the fast food menu is growing all the time .
berlin alone boasts a massive 2,000 fast food stands with representatives from italy , china , japan , turkey , greece , the arab nations and northern africa . nonetheless , the supply never seems to be fully exhausted and , it seems , as long as foreigners continue to knock at germany 's door , berliners will continue to be wooed by a growing array of exotic and greasy taste sensations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bratwurst for the weekend , sir ?

a controversial software patent directive up for a vote in the european parliament has stirred up intense debate .
critics claim the ruling would stifle innovation and put smaller software companies out of business . a vote on the proposed guidelines , called the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions , has already been delayed twice due to impassioned protests by backers of open-source software .
they say passage of the regulation would have dire consequences for newcomers in the market and developers of free software products .
the draft directive , which has been through 120 amendments , is being debated on tuesday in the parliament and is expected to come to a vote on wednesday .
in most eu countries , software is treated in the same way as the written word and receives copyright protection .
the new guidelines seek to introduce patenting and its proponents say it will harmonize laws that currently differ across eu states .
but critics have lashed out at the proposal , saying it only benefits larger companies and is a job killer .
smaller companies , which are often the most innovative , will suffer the most , according to jeremy newton of the law firm nabarro nathanson .
“ to go out and seek patent protection is costly and very demanding .
small companies will say , ‘ we can ’ t afford this protection . ’
that is a fact of life , ” he told vnunet.com , a technology news website .
two of the world ’ s most renowned figures in the open-source community , linus torvalds and alan cox , have written an open letter to the european parliament urging it to reject the proposal .
“ unlike traditional patents , software patents do not encourage innovation and r & d. quite the contrary , ” they wrote .
torvalds invented the linux basic core and cox is one of the most influential linux developers .
linux is a operating system similar to microsoft windows , whose source code is available to everyone free of charge .
it has become a formidable force in the software industry , but software patents could threaten its open-source development model .
a clearer framework the british mep who introduced the directive last year , arlene mccarthy , defended the proposed guidelines on tuesday in strasbourg , seat of the european parliament , saying it would help protect scientists and companies against competition from american software firms and make the legal framework around computer-related patents more consistent and understandable .
the german federation of information , telecommunication and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- has come out in support of the proposed rules , arguing smaller firms will benefit by protecting their inventions with patents .
“ innovation costs time and effort .
a patent will enable companies to regain some of that investment , ” susanne schopf , head of bitkom ’ s legal protection department , told german television .
according to the directive ’ s backers , more than 20,000 computer-related patents have already been issued on software developments in the eu .
they say the 120 amendments that have made to the draft guidelines since its introduction ensure that only inventions that represent significant technical developments are eligible for patents .
“ u.s.-style mess ” critics such as torvalds and cox , however , say the directive is worded in such a way that virtually any software or electronic business process could be patented , which is already the case in the u.s.
“ in principle we are in favor of harmonisation , but not so that it goes into a u.s.-style mess , ” john holden , senior research analyst at butler group , told vnunet.com.
but he added that patent legislation has not stopped innovation in the u.s. computer scientists , software developers and representatives of small and medium-sized companies across the eu have expressed concern over the proposed change in the law .
last month , a group of 12 leading economists also urged the european parliament to reject the directive , warning that it could produce “ extensive portfolios of software patents ” that favor large corporations . “ while some small and medium-sized firms will be able to prosper in this environment , many will not , ” the letter said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de linux penguins invade germany in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .
but since becoming bundesliga champion in 2002 , the club has fallen on hard times .
last year the team only managed third place and this season dortmund failed to qualify for the lucrative and prestigious champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . as the only bundesliga club listed on the stock exchange , losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
in an effort to help its finances , the club announced on monday that the players had agreed to take a 20 percent pay cut , should the team not bring in the necessary revenue by making it to the uefa cup and bundesliga finals . but the show of solidarity by the players is unlikely to deter eichel or his boss and known soccer fan chancellor gerhard schröder from revamping the rules for weekend shift tax allowances . “ the chancellor is in complete agreement with me that this situation is untenable , but that lower-income earners – for whom this law was originally meant – shouldn ’ t be penalized , ” said eichel . schröder ’ s government , strapped for cash itself these days , is extremely aware that germans will have little sympathy for millionaire soccer stars and their big-business clubs as towns and cities across the country are being forced to close swimming pools , fire policemen and cut back on services due to a shortage of tax revenues . outrage over " florida rolf " the drive to change the tax allowance rules for well-paid athletes comes on the heels of broad public outrage that the german social security system was paying welfare to some citizens that were living abroad .
one recipient in particular , a so-called “ florida rolf ” whose apartment in miami is paid for by german taxpayers , became a lighting rod for criticism over how social security is misused . after smelling blood over dortmund ’ s tax plans , eichel may be inclined to go after other sports that are even more flagrant in their creative use of germany ’ s welfare system .
ice hockey and basketball teams frequently allow their players to receive unemployment for the two to three months out of the year that there are no matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be on the dole ?
jürgen leister , a lawyer who represents the interests of sport professionals within the services trade union verdi , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the practice was also completely legal .
“ it does make me a little queasy , but that ’ s the law , ” he told the paper . even worse , although players often have only one-season contracts , many have already negotiated options for extending them for the following year .
leister said the players only needed to be reachable by the labor office while they were collecting dole payments that frequently total around € 3,000 a month . “ but when was the last time you heard of a pro getting a job via a placement center ? ”

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .
but since becoming bundesliga champion in 2002 , the club has fallen on hard times .
last year the team only managed third place and this season dortmund failed to qualify for the lucrative and prestigious champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . as the only bundesliga club listed on the stock exchange , losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .

with nato locked in internal strife , jaap de hoop scheffer of the netherlands is conflict-free choice as the new secretary general of the alliance . jaap de hoop scheffer , a christian democrat from the netherlands , was among the first to speak out in favor of the united states proceeding in the war against iraq without a united nations mandate .
though in contrast to his counterparts in spain , italy and britain he was barely audible in the cacophony of european voices , his " yes " went down well in washington . the lawyer , who is seen as a bit of a bore in his native holland consistently stresses the importance of europe in the alliance and the role it has to play in ensuring nato is equipped to deal with future issues .
the new candidate is also in favor of a particular military role , which pleases both the " old " and " new " europeans , as u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld dubbed those nations opposed to and in favor of the u.s. stance , respectively . clever mediator hoop scheffer 's political contemporaries speak highly of his outstanding ability to forge compromises and the skill with which he balances on diplomatic tightropes .
his one-time superior , the former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , which is currently a much needed quality back at nato headquarters .
gone is the cold war era when a nato leader could give off a mere growl to keep the warsaw pact in check .
these days the top diplomat needs a honed dove-like coo if he is to keep the illustrious 17 , soon to be 26 , member nations on course , and succeed at building the apparently necessary maze of bridges between the two sides of the atlantic . the u.s. , which is undoubtedly the greatest military might in the alliance , sees nato as a kind of toolbox to be used in the handling of missions such as that of international security troops in afghanistan .
on the other side of the coin there is europe which favors an independent military role , and the new alliance leader will have to negotiate between these two poles . a harmless leader overall , the relative ease with which jaap de hoop scheffer was elected to head up the alliance is an indication that the meaning of the transatlantic alliance is no longer such that london , paris , berlin or london felt it worth igniting a full-scale row over personnel issues . de hoop scheffer will harm no one , although france uttered some initial skepticism about the man who was reported to have an excellent relationship to u.s. president george w. bush .
that particular rumor seeped out into the world when , during an interview with the u.s. vice president dick cheney at the start of september , de hoop scheffer was spontaneously joined by the president himself as he coincidentally entered the room and sat down to join in .
paris was soon soothed into giving the dutch man a chance with news that de hoop scheffer is not only in favor of a strong europe , but also speaks fluent french , and even considers watching french movies one of his hobbies . back home in the netherlands , nato 's new leader 's own political party had refused to let him run as a candidate for prime minister on the grounds that his charisma was simply not up to the job .
but jan peter balkenende who ultimately led the christian democrats to election victory rewarded his political contemporary with the post of foreign minister . now both de hoop scheffer and the netherlands are being rewarded again , this time for remaining faithful to the u.s. , whose leaders evidently do n't count charisma as a prerequisite for the job . bernd riegert is deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch foreign minister slated to head nato career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term .

with nato locked in internal strife , jaap de hoop scheffer of the netherlands is conflict-free choice as the new secretary general of the alliance . jaap de hoop scheffer , a christian democrat from the netherlands , was among the first to speak out in favor of the united states proceeding in the war against iraq without a united nations mandate .
though in contrast to his counterparts in spain , italy and britain he was barely audible in the cacophony of european voices , his " yes " went down well in washington . the lawyer , who is seen as a bit of a bore in his native holland consistently stresses the importance of europe in the alliance and the role it has to play in ensuring nato is equipped to deal with future issues .
the new candidate is also in favor of a particular military role , which pleases both the " old " and " new " europeans , as u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld dubbed those nations opposed to and in favor of the u.s. stance , respectively . clever mediator hoop scheffer 's political contemporaries speak highly of his outstanding ability to forge compromises and the skill with which he balances on diplomatic tightropes .

as the modern world continues its saucy and long-standing love affair with fast food , a berlin museum has whipped together a feast of alimentary icons in an exhibition which explores the social phenomenon of junk food . be it standing , moving , on the go or in between meals , we all eat fast food - even german chancellor gerhard schröder .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new exhibition at the domäne dahlem museum in berlin seeks to shed new light on the social phenomenon of fast food . it 's an elemental experience for junk food junkies and provides the chance for them to get their biggest fix yet .
room upon room of exhibits paint the bigger picture of the sometimes delicious , sometimes depressing world of the universal snack bar .
from french fries to pizza " imbissbuden - essen ohne grenzen " -lrb- snack bars - food without frontiers -rrb- is a cooperation between the museum and publicist jon von wetzlar which seeks to explore the architectonic , culinary and sociological effects of these urban anarchists on their surroundings .

it was then 120 years later that the popular bockwurst sausage made its first fast food appearance , followed by a berlin creation that is still a firm favorite .
the berliner currywurst , sausage smothered in sauce , is like a large frankfurter sausage cut into pieces then doused in tomato ketchup and sprinkled with a generous helping of curry powder .
it was the brainchild of herta heuwer , whose contribution to berlin 's culinary landscape was so highly regarded that a commemorative plaque was erected following her death in 1999 .
even the great pillar of fast food culture , the hamburger , is believed to have its roots in germany . in 1906 an entrepreneur and son of a german immigrant who went by the name of erich playowski , began serving small meatballs covered with melted cheese in white bread at his snack bar next to an ohio football field .

as the modern world continues its saucy and long-standing love affair with fast food , a berlin museum has whipped together a feast of alimentary icons in an exhibition which explores the social phenomenon of junk food . be it standing , moving , on the go or in between meals , we all eat fast food - even german chancellor gerhard schröder .
be it in helsinki , st. petersberg or closer to home in paderborn , people are addicted to fast food , a panacea for spontaneous cravings .
welcome to the microcosmo of plastic packaging , plastic forks and deep-frozen foods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new exhibition at the domäne dahlem museum in berlin seeks to shed new light on the social phenomenon of fast food . it 's an elemental experience for junk food junkies and provides the chance for them to get their biggest fix yet .
room upon room of exhibits paint the bigger picture of the sometimes delicious , sometimes depressing world of the universal snack bar .
from french fries to pizza " imbissbuden - essen ohne grenzen " -lrb- snack bars - food without frontiers -rrb- is a cooperation between the museum and publicist jon von wetzlar which seeks to explore the architectonic , culinary and sociological effects of these urban anarchists on their surroundings .
with photos , videos , paintings , visuals , sound installations , light effects and even smell sensations , the exhibition , like most snack bars , has something for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an array of items contributed to the show by artist patricia waller include crocheted french fries , hamburgers and pizza slices that have proven especially popular with the show 's younger visitors . the walls are lined with photographs depicting the kitchy uniqueness of dozens of snack bars discovered by von wetzlar during a research odyssey around the outskirts of berlin .
the images , which include joints with glaringly green artificial lawns and compulsory high tables , were shot by photographer christoph buckstegen , have been compiled in a book entitled urban anarchisten - die kultur der imbissbude -lrb- urban anarchists - the culture of the snack bar -rrb- .
modest beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the show 's curators , berlin got its first taste of fast food some 200 years ago when a pioneering foodie opened a cinnamon pretzel stand in the city 's spandau district .
it was then 120 years later that the popular bockwurst sausage made its first fast food appearance , followed by a berlin creation that is still a firm favorite .
the berliner currywurst , sausage smothered in sauce , is like a large frankfurter sausage cut into pieces then doused in tomato ketchup and sprinkled with a generous helping of curry powder .
it was the brainchild of herta heuwer , whose contribution to berlin 's culinary landscape was so highly regarded that a commemorative plaque was erected following her death in 1999 .
even the great pillar of fast food culture , the hamburger , is believed to have its roots in germany . in 1906 an entrepreneur and son of a german immigrant who went by the name of erich playowski , began serving small meatballs covered with melted cheese in white bread at his snack bar next to an ohio football field .
he named them after his home town of hamburg , and a legend was born .
the tradition evolves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from pizza to hamburgers , sushi to falafal , the fast food menu is growing all the time .
berlin alone boasts a massive 2,000 fast food stands with representatives from italy , china , japan , turkey , greece , the arab nations and northern africa . nonetheless , the supply never seems to be fully exhausted and , it seems , as long as foreigners continue to knock at germany 's door , berliners will continue to be wooed by a growing array of exotic and greasy taste sensations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bratwurst for the weekend , sir ?

with nato locked in internal strife , jaap de hoop scheffer of the netherlands is conflict-free choice as the new secretary general of the alliance . jaap de hoop scheffer , a christian democrat from the netherlands , was among the first to speak out in favor of the united states proceeding in the war against iraq without a united nations mandate .
though in contrast to his counterparts in spain , italy and britain he was barely audible in the cacophony of european voices , his " yes " went down well in washington . the lawyer , who is seen as a bit of a bore in his native holland consistently stresses the importance of europe in the alliance and the role it has to play in ensuring nato is equipped to deal with future issues .
the new candidate is also in favor of a particular military role , which pleases both the " old " and " new " europeans , as u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld dubbed those nations opposed to and in favor of the u.s. stance , respectively . clever mediator hoop scheffer 's political contemporaries speak highly of his outstanding ability to forge compromises and the skill with which he balances on diplomatic tightropes .
his one-time superior , the former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , which is currently a much needed quality back at nato headquarters .
gone is the cold war era when a nato leader could give off a mere growl to keep the warsaw pact in check .
these days the top diplomat needs a honed dove-like coo if he is to keep the illustrious 17 , soon to be 26 , member nations on course , and succeed at building the apparently necessary maze of bridges between the two sides of the atlantic . the u.s. , which is undoubtedly the greatest military might in the alliance , sees nato as a kind of toolbox to be used in the handling of missions such as that of international security troops in afghanistan .
on the other side of the coin there is europe which favors an independent military role , and the new alliance leader will have to negotiate between these two poles . a harmless leader overall , the relative ease with which jaap de hoop scheffer was elected to head up the alliance is an indication that the meaning of the transatlantic alliance is no longer such that london , paris , berlin or london felt it worth igniting a full-scale row over personnel issues . de hoop scheffer will harm no one , although france uttered some initial skepticism about the man who was reported to have an excellent relationship to u.s. president george w. bush .
that particular rumor seeped out into the world when , during an interview with the u.s. vice president dick cheney at the start of september , de hoop scheffer was spontaneously joined by the president himself as he coincidentally entered the room and sat down to join in .
paris was soon soothed into giving the dutch man a chance with news that de hoop scheffer is not only in favor of a strong europe , but also speaks fluent french , and even considers watching french movies one of his hobbies . back home in the netherlands , nato 's new leader 's own political party had refused to let him run as a candidate for prime minister on the grounds that his charisma was simply not up to the job .
but jan peter balkenende who ultimately led the christian democrats to election victory rewarded his political contemporary with the post of foreign minister . now both de hoop scheffer and the netherlands are being rewarded again , this time for remaining faithful to the u.s. , whose leaders evidently do n't count charisma as a prerequisite for the job . bernd riegert is deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch foreign minister slated to head nato career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .
but since becoming bundesliga champion in 2002 , the club has fallen on hard times .
last year the team only managed third place and this season dortmund failed to qualify for the lucrative and prestigious champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . as the only bundesliga club listed on the stock exchange , losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
in an effort to help its finances , the club announced on monday that the players had agreed to take a 20 percent pay cut , should the team not bring in the necessary revenue by making it to the uefa cup and bundesliga finals . but the show of solidarity by the players is unlikely to deter eichel or his boss and known soccer fan chancellor gerhard schröder from revamping the rules for weekend shift tax allowances . “ the chancellor is in complete agreement with me that this situation is untenable , but that lower-income earners – for whom this law was originally meant – shouldn ’ t be penalized , ” said eichel . schröder ’ s government , strapped for cash itself these days , is extremely aware that germans will have little sympathy for millionaire soccer stars and their big-business clubs as towns and cities across the country are being forced to close swimming pools , fire policemen and cut back on services due to a shortage of tax revenues . outrage over " florida rolf " the drive to change the tax allowance rules for well-paid athletes comes on the heels of broad public outrage that the german social security system was paying welfare to some citizens that were living abroad .
one recipient in particular , a so-called “ florida rolf ” whose apartment in miami is paid for by german taxpayers , became a lighting rod for criticism over how social security is misused . after smelling blood over dortmund ’ s tax plans , eichel may be inclined to go after other sports that are even more flagrant in their creative use of germany ’ s welfare system .
ice hockey and basketball teams frequently allow their players to receive unemployment for the two to three months out of the year that there are no matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be on the dole ?
jürgen leister , a lawyer who represents the interests of sport professionals within the services trade union verdi , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the practice was also completely legal .
“ it does make me a little queasy , but that ’ s the law , ” he told the paper . even worse , although players often have only one-season contracts , many have already negotiated options for extending them for the following year .
leister said the players only needed to be reachable by the labor office while they were collecting dole payments that frequently total around € 3,000 a month . “ but when was the last time you heard of a pro getting a job via a placement center ? ”

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .
but since becoming bundesliga champion in 2002 , the club has fallen on hard times .
last year the team only managed third place and this season dortmund failed to qualify for the lucrative and prestigious champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . as the only bundesliga club listed on the stock exchange , losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
in an effort to help its finances , the club announced on monday that the players had agreed to take a 20 percent pay cut , should the team not bring in the necessary revenue by making it to the uefa cup and bundesliga finals . but the show of solidarity by the players is unlikely to deter eichel or his boss and known soccer fan chancellor gerhard schröder from revamping the rules for weekend shift tax allowances . “ the chancellor is in complete agreement with me that this situation is untenable , but that lower-income earners – for whom this law was originally meant – shouldn ’ t be penalized , ” said eichel . schröder ’ s government , strapped for cash itself these days , is extremely aware that germans will have little sympathy for millionaire soccer stars and their big-business clubs as towns and cities across the country are being forced to close swimming pools , fire policemen and cut back on services due to a shortage of tax revenues . outrage over " florida rolf " the drive to change the tax allowance rules for well-paid athletes comes on the heels of broad public outrage that the german social security system was paying welfare to some citizens that were living abroad .
one recipient in particular , a so-called “ florida rolf ” whose apartment in miami is paid for by german taxpayers , became a lighting rod for criticism over how social security is misused . after smelling blood over dortmund ’ s tax plans , eichel may be inclined to go after other sports that are even more flagrant in their creative use of germany ’ s welfare system .
ice hockey and basketball teams frequently allow their players to receive unemployment for the two to three months out of the year that there are no matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be on the dole ?
jürgen leister , a lawyer who represents the interests of sport professionals within the services trade union verdi , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the practice was also completely legal .
“ it does make me a little queasy , but that ’ s the law , ” he told the paper . even worse , although players often have only one-season contracts , many have already negotiated options for extending them for the following year .
leister said the players only needed to be reachable by the labor office while they were collecting dole payments that frequently total around € 3,000 a month . “ but when was the last time you heard of a pro getting a job via a placement center ? ”

a controversial software patent directive up for a vote in the european parliament has stirred up intense debate .
critics claim the ruling would stifle innovation and put smaller software companies out of business . a vote on the proposed guidelines , called the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions , has already been delayed twice due to impassioned protests by backers of open-source software .
they say passage of the regulation would have dire consequences for newcomers in the market and developers of free software products .
the draft directive , which has been through 120 amendments , is being debated on tuesday in the parliament and is expected to come to a vote on wednesday .
in most eu countries , software is treated in the same way as the written word and receives copyright protection .
the new guidelines seek to introduce patenting and its proponents say it will harmonize laws that currently differ across eu states .
but critics have lashed out at the proposal , saying it only benefits larger companies and is a job killer .
smaller companies , which are often the most innovative , will suffer the most , according to jeremy newton of the law firm nabarro nathanson .
“ to go out and seek patent protection is costly and very demanding .
small companies will say , ‘ we can ’ t afford this protection . ’
that is a fact of life , ” he told vnunet.com , a technology news website .
two of the world ’ s most renowned figures in the open-source community , linus torvalds and alan cox , have written an open letter to the european parliament urging it to reject the proposal .
“ unlike traditional patents , software patents do not encourage innovation and r & d. quite the contrary , ” they wrote .
torvalds invented the linux basic core and cox is one of the most influential linux developers .
linux is a operating system similar to microsoft windows , whose source code is available to everyone free of charge .
it has become a formidable force in the software industry , but software patents could threaten its open-source development model .
a clearer framework the british mep who introduced the directive last year , arlene mccarthy , defended the proposed guidelines on tuesday in strasbourg , seat of the european parliament , saying it would help protect scientists and companies against competition from american software firms and make the legal framework around computer-related patents more consistent and understandable .
the german federation of information , telecommunication and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- has come out in support of the proposed rules , arguing smaller firms will benefit by protecting their inventions with patents .
“ innovation costs time and effort .
a patent will enable companies to regain some of that investment , ” susanne schopf , head of bitkom ’ s legal protection department , told german television .
according to the directive ’ s backers , more than 20,000 computer-related patents have already been issued on software developments in the eu .
they say the 120 amendments that have made to the draft guidelines since its introduction ensure that only inventions that represent significant technical developments are eligible for patents .
“ u.s.-style mess ” critics such as torvalds and cox , however , say the directive is worded in such a way that virtually any software or electronic business process could be patented , which is already the case in the u.s.
“ in principle we are in favor of harmonisation , but not so that it goes into a u.s.-style mess , ” john holden , senior research analyst at butler group , told vnunet.com.
but he added that patent legislation has not stopped innovation in the u.s. computer scientists , software developers and representatives of small and medium-sized companies across the eu have expressed concern over the proposed change in the law .
last month , a group of 12 leading economists also urged the european parliament to reject the directive , warning that it could produce “ extensive portfolios of software patents ” that favor large corporations . “ while some small and medium-sized firms will be able to prosper in this environment , many will not , ” the letter said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de linux penguins invade germany in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system .

as the modern world continues its saucy and long-standing love affair with fast food , a berlin museum has whipped together a feast of alimentary icons in an exhibition which explores the social phenomenon of junk food . be it standing , moving , on the go or in between meals , we all eat fast food - even german chancellor gerhard schröder .
be it in helsinki , st. petersberg or closer to home in paderborn , people are addicted to fast food , a panacea for spontaneous cravings .
welcome to the microcosmo of plastic packaging , plastic forks and deep-frozen foods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new exhibition at the domäne dahlem museum in berlin seeks to shed new light on the social phenomenon of fast food . it 's an elemental experience for junk food junkies and provides the chance for them to get their biggest fix yet .
room upon room of exhibits paint the bigger picture of the sometimes delicious , sometimes depressing world of the universal snack bar .
from french fries to pizza " imbissbuden - essen ohne grenzen " -lrb- snack bars - food without frontiers -rrb- is a cooperation between the museum and publicist jon von wetzlar which seeks to explore the architectonic , culinary and sociological effects of these urban anarchists on their surroundings .
with photos , videos , paintings , visuals , sound installations , light effects and even smell sensations , the exhibition , like most snack bars , has something for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an array of items contributed to the show by artist patricia waller include crocheted french fries , hamburgers and pizza slices that have proven especially popular with the show 's younger visitors . the walls are lined with photographs depicting the kitchy uniqueness of dozens of snack bars discovered by von wetzlar during a research odyssey around the outskirts of berlin .
the images , which include joints with glaringly green artificial lawns and compulsory high tables , were shot by photographer christoph buckstegen , have been compiled in a book entitled urban anarchisten - die kultur der imbissbude -lrb- urban anarchists - the culture of the snack bar -rrb- .
modest beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the show 's curators , berlin got its first taste of fast food some 200 years ago when a pioneering foodie opened a cinnamon pretzel stand in the city 's spandau district .
it was then 120 years later that the popular bockwurst sausage made its first fast food appearance , followed by a berlin creation that is still a firm favorite .
the berliner currywurst , sausage smothered in sauce , is like a large frankfurter sausage cut into pieces then doused in tomato ketchup and sprinkled with a generous helping of curry powder .
it was the brainchild of herta heuwer , whose contribution to berlin 's culinary landscape was so highly regarded that a commemorative plaque was erected following her death in 1999 .
even the great pillar of fast food culture , the hamburger , is believed to have its roots in germany . in 1906 an entrepreneur and son of a german immigrant who went by the name of erich playowski , began serving small meatballs covered with melted cheese in white bread at his snack bar next to an ohio football field .
he named them after his home town of hamburg , and a legend was born .
the tradition evolves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from pizza to hamburgers , sushi to falafal , the fast food menu is growing all the time .
berlin alone boasts a massive 2,000 fast food stands with representatives from italy , china , japan , turkey , greece , the arab nations and northern africa . nonetheless , the supply never seems to be fully exhausted and , it seems , as long as foreigners continue to knock at germany 's door , berliners will continue to be wooed by a growing array of exotic and greasy taste sensations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bratwurst for the weekend , sir ?
forget viagra : german scientists are claiming that a daily bratwurst is enough to improve potency in middle-aged males by over 60 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : schröder hopes to mend ties with bush the powell visit rumsfeld repeats " old europe " comments u.s. and europe face diplomatic challenges in evian germany : no nato in iraq without un current affairs -pipe- 23.09.2003 schröder and bush set to bury the hatchet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. president george bush and german chancellor gerhard schröder last had high-level talks in may 2002 .
chancellor schröder and president bush hope to put transatlantic relations back on track this week with their first one-on-one meeting in 16 months in new york .
but disagreements over iraq are likely to persist . german chancellor gerhard schröder is ostensibly traveling to new york to address the united nations general assembly and celebrate the 30th anniversary of german u.n. membership , but few observers doubt that the most important part of his three-day trip will be a 30 minute meeting with u.s. president george bush on wednesday . the encounter will be the first time the two leaders have held bilateral talks since they fell out over the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as one of the most vocal critics of the war , schröder has long been considered a persona non grata for bush . bush is said to have been not only angered by schröder ’ s decision to use anti-war rhetoric to boost his flagging reelection campaign last year , but also by comments from a later sacked german cabinet member that said bush was using foreign conflicts to distract from domestic problems just as adolph hitler did . thawing relations but there have been increasing signs of a thaw in german-american relations in recent weeks and the meeting in new york will underline that bush is perhaps ready to put his differences with schröder aside in order to improve ties between the two countries . in an interview with fox news on monday evening bush expressed understanding for germany ’ s anti-war position and the pacifism that grew out of the country ’ s experiences in world war ii .
he said he looked forward to “ substantive talks ” with schröder and also praised germany ’ s “ active role ” in afghanistan .
“ i appreciate this support , ” bush said . as the u.s. costs and casualties in postwar iraq continue to mount , bush has been compelled to return to the united nations in order to seek international help in stabilizing the country .
he is hoping the u.n. security council will agree to a new resolution that would encourage more nations to send peacekeepers . schröder , who is particularly keen to end the bad blood with the grudge-holding texan , is likely hoping to mediate between bush and other war opponents including french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
after talking with bush , schröder will meet with the french and russian leaders later on wednesday in new york . as schröder ’ s left berlin on monday , a german government official was at pains to say the trilateral summit was not an attempt to form renewed opposition to washington .
“ it ’ s definitely not signaling an opposing axis to the cooperation with the usa , ” the official told reporters being briefed on the chancellor ’ s trip .
“ germany certainly doesn ’ t see itself as an opposing pole to the united states . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and while hosting a three-way summit with france and britain in berlin over the weekend , schröder appeared to take the middle ground between chirac and staunch u.s. ally british prime minister tony blair . in an editorial published in the new york times on friday , schröder said germany was prepared to share the burden in iraq .
“ it is true that germany and the united states disagreed on how best to deal with saddam hussein 's regime .

chancellor schröder and president bush hope to put transatlantic relations back on track this week with their first one-on-one meeting in 16 months in new york .
but disagreements over iraq are likely to persist . german chancellor gerhard schröder is ostensibly traveling to new york to address the united nations general assembly and celebrate the 30th anniversary of german u.n. membership , but few observers doubt that the most important part of his three-day trip will be a 30 minute meeting with u.s. president george bush on wednesday . the encounter will be the first time the two leaders have held bilateral talks since they fell out over the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as one of the most vocal critics of the war , schröder has long been considered a persona non grata for bush . bush is said to have been not only angered by schröder ’ s decision to use anti-war rhetoric to boost his flagging reelection campaign last year , but also by comments from a later sacked german cabinet member that said bush was using foreign conflicts to distract from domestic problems just as adolph hitler did . thawing relations but there have been increasing signs of a thaw in german-american relations in recent weeks and the meeting in new york will underline that bush is perhaps ready to put his differences with schröder aside in order to improve ties between the two countries . in an interview with fox news on monday evening bush expressed understanding for germany ’ s anti-war position and the pacifism that grew out of the country ’ s experiences in world war ii .
he said he looked forward to “ substantive talks ” with schröder and also praised germany ’ s “ active role ” in afghanistan .
“ i appreciate this support , ” bush said . as the u.s. costs and casualties in postwar iraq continue to mount , bush has been compelled to return to the united nations in order to seek international help in stabilizing the country .
he is hoping the u.n. security council will agree to a new resolution that would encourage more nations to send peacekeepers . schröder , who is particularly keen to end the bad blood with the grudge-holding texan , is likely hoping to mediate between bush and other war opponents including french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
after talking with bush , schröder will meet with the french and russian leaders later on wednesday in new york . as schröder ’ s left berlin on monday , a german government official was at pains to say the trilateral summit was not an attempt to form renewed opposition to washington .
“ it ’ s definitely not signaling an opposing axis to the cooperation with the usa , ” the official told reporters being briefed on the chancellor ’ s trip .
“ germany certainly doesn ’ t see itself as an opposing pole to the united states . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and while hosting a three-way summit with france and britain in berlin over the weekend , schröder appeared to take the middle ground between chirac and staunch u.s. ally british prime minister tony blair . in an editorial published in the new york times on friday , schröder said germany was prepared to share the burden in iraq .

as the modern world continues its saucy and long-standing love affair with fast food , a berlin museum has whipped together a feast of alimentary icons in an exhibition which explores the social phenomenon of junk food . be it standing , moving , on the go or in between meals , we all eat fast food - even german chancellor gerhard schröder .
be it in helsinki , st. petersberg or closer to home in paderborn , people are addicted to fast food , a panacea for spontaneous cravings .
welcome to the microcosmo of plastic packaging , plastic forks and deep-frozen foods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new exhibition at the domäne dahlem museum in berlin seeks to shed new light on the social phenomenon of fast food . it 's an elemental experience for junk food junkies and provides the chance for them to get their biggest fix yet .
room upon room of exhibits paint the bigger picture of the sometimes delicious , sometimes depressing world of the universal snack bar .
from french fries to pizza " imbissbuden - essen ohne grenzen " -lrb- snack bars - food without frontiers -rrb- is a cooperation between the museum and publicist jon von wetzlar which seeks to explore the architectonic , culinary and sociological effects of these urban anarchists on their surroundings .
with photos , videos , paintings , visuals , sound installations , light effects and even smell sensations , the exhibition , like most snack bars , has something for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an array of items contributed to the show by artist patricia waller include crocheted french fries , hamburgers and pizza slices that have proven especially popular with the show 's younger visitors . the walls are lined with photographs depicting the kitchy uniqueness of dozens of snack bars discovered by von wetzlar during a research odyssey around the outskirts of berlin .
the images , which include joints with glaringly green artificial lawns and compulsory high tables , were shot by photographer christoph buckstegen , have been compiled in a book entitled urban anarchisten - die kultur der imbissbude -lrb- urban anarchists - the culture of the snack bar -rrb- .
modest beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the show 's curators , berlin got its first taste of fast food some 200 years ago when a pioneering foodie opened a cinnamon pretzel stand in the city 's spandau district .
it was then 120 years later that the popular bockwurst sausage made its first fast food appearance , followed by a berlin creation that is still a firm favorite .
the berliner currywurst , sausage smothered in sauce , is like a large frankfurter sausage cut into pieces then doused in tomato ketchup and sprinkled with a generous helping of curry powder .
it was the brainchild of herta heuwer , whose contribution to berlin 's culinary landscape was so highly regarded that a commemorative plaque was erected following her death in 1999 .
even the great pillar of fast food culture , the hamburger , is believed to have its roots in germany . in 1906 an entrepreneur and son of a german immigrant who went by the name of erich playowski , began serving small meatballs covered with melted cheese in white bread at his snack bar next to an ohio football field .
he named them after his home town of hamburg , and a legend was born .
the tradition evolves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from pizza to hamburgers , sushi to falafal , the fast food menu is growing all the time .
berlin alone boasts a massive 2,000 fast food stands with representatives from italy , china , japan , turkey , greece , the arab nations and northern africa . nonetheless , the supply never seems to be fully exhausted and , it seems , as long as foreigners continue to knock at germany 's door , berliners will continue to be wooed by a growing array of exotic and greasy taste sensations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bratwurst for the weekend , sir ?

as the modern world continues its saucy and long-standing love affair with fast food , a berlin museum has whipped together a feast of alimentary icons in an exhibition which explores the social phenomenon of junk food . be it standing , moving , on the go or in between meals , we all eat fast food - even german chancellor gerhard schröder .
be it in helsinki , st. petersberg or closer to home in paderborn , people are addicted to fast food , a panacea for spontaneous cravings .
welcome to the microcosmo of plastic packaging , plastic forks and deep-frozen foods .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new exhibition at the domäne dahlem museum in berlin seeks to shed new light on the social phenomenon of fast food . it 's an elemental experience for junk food junkies and provides the chance for them to get their biggest fix yet .
room upon room of exhibits paint the bigger picture of the sometimes delicious , sometimes depressing world of the universal snack bar .
from french fries to pizza " imbissbuden - essen ohne grenzen " -lrb- snack bars - food without frontiers -rrb- is a cooperation between the museum and publicist jon von wetzlar which seeks to explore the architectonic , culinary and sociological effects of these urban anarchists on their surroundings .
with photos , videos , paintings , visuals , sound installations , light effects and even smell sensations , the exhibition , like most snack bars , has something for everyone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an array of items contributed to the show by artist patricia waller include crocheted french fries , hamburgers and pizza slices that have proven especially popular with the show 's younger visitors . the walls are lined with photographs depicting the kitchy uniqueness of dozens of snack bars discovered by von wetzlar during a research odyssey around the outskirts of berlin .
the images , which include joints with glaringly green artificial lawns and compulsory high tables , were shot by photographer christoph buckstegen , have been compiled in a book entitled urban anarchisten - die kultur der imbissbude -lrb- urban anarchists - the culture of the snack bar -rrb- .
modest beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the show 's curators , berlin got its first taste of fast food some 200 years ago when a pioneering foodie opened a cinnamon pretzel stand in the city 's spandau district .
it was then 120 years later that the popular bockwurst sausage made its first fast food appearance , followed by a berlin creation that is still a firm favorite .
the berliner currywurst , sausage smothered in sauce , is like a large frankfurter sausage cut into pieces then doused in tomato ketchup and sprinkled with a generous helping of curry powder .
it was the brainchild of herta heuwer , whose contribution to berlin 's culinary landscape was so highly regarded that a commemorative plaque was erected following her death in 1999 .
even the great pillar of fast food culture , the hamburger , is believed to have its roots in germany . in 1906 an entrepreneur and son of a german immigrant who went by the name of erich playowski , began serving small meatballs covered with melted cheese in white bread at his snack bar next to an ohio football field .
he named them after his home town of hamburg , and a legend was born .
the tradition evolves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from pizza to hamburgers , sushi to falafal , the fast food menu is growing all the time .
berlin alone boasts a massive 2,000 fast food stands with representatives from italy , china , japan , turkey , greece , the arab nations and northern africa . nonetheless , the supply never seems to be fully exhausted and , it seems , as long as foreigners continue to knock at germany 's door , berliners will continue to be wooed by a growing array of exotic and greasy taste sensations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bratwurst for the weekend , sir ?

chancellor schröder and president bush hope to put transatlantic relations back on track this week with their first one-on-one meeting in 16 months in new york .
but disagreements over iraq are likely to persist . german chancellor gerhard schröder is ostensibly traveling to new york to address the united nations general assembly and celebrate the 30th anniversary of german u.n. membership , but few observers doubt that the most important part of his three-day trip will be a 30 minute meeting with u.s. president george bush on wednesday . the encounter will be the first time the two leaders have held bilateral talks since they fell out over the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as one of the most vocal critics of the war , schröder has long been considered a persona non grata for bush . bush is said to have been not only angered by schröder ’ s decision to use anti-war rhetoric to boost his flagging reelection campaign last year , but also by comments from a later sacked german cabinet member that said bush was using foreign conflicts to distract from domestic problems just as adolph hitler did . thawing relations but there have been increasing signs of a thaw in german-american relations in recent weeks and the meeting in new york will underline that bush is perhaps ready to put his differences with schröder aside in order to improve ties between the two countries . in an interview with fox news on monday evening bush expressed understanding for germany ’ s anti-war position and the pacifism that grew out of the country ’ s experiences in world war ii .
he said he looked forward to “ substantive talks ” with schröder and also praised germany ’ s “ active role ” in afghanistan .
“ i appreciate this support , ” bush said . as the u.s. costs and casualties in postwar iraq continue to mount , bush has been compelled to return to the united nations in order to seek international help in stabilizing the country .
he is hoping the u.n. security council will agree to a new resolution that would encourage more nations to send peacekeepers . schröder , who is particularly keen to end the bad blood with the grudge-holding texan , is likely hoping to mediate between bush and other war opponents including french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
after talking with bush , schröder will meet with the french and russian leaders later on wednesday in new york . as schröder ’ s left berlin on monday , a german government official was at pains to say the trilateral summit was not an attempt to form renewed opposition to washington .
“ it ’ s definitely not signaling an opposing axis to the cooperation with the usa , ” the official told reporters being briefed on the chancellor ’ s trip .
“ germany certainly doesn ’ t see itself as an opposing pole to the united states . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and while hosting a three-way summit with france and britain in berlin over the weekend , schröder appeared to take the middle ground between chirac and staunch u.s. ally british prime minister tony blair . in an editorial published in the new york times on friday , schröder said germany was prepared to share the burden in iraq .
“ it is true that germany and the united states disagreed on how best to deal with saddam hussein 's regime .
there is no point in continuing this debate , ” schröder wrote .
“ we should now look toward the future .
we must work together to win the peace . ” pushing for a stronger u.n. role but schröder ’ s desire to make amends with bush doesn ’ t mean he will likely back away from german and french demands for a stronger role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq .
both countries are pushing for a speedy transition from u.s. occupation to iraqi sovereignty , but washington has so far dismissed a quick transfer of power as unrealistic . schröder has also made clear the united states can not expect berlin to send troops to help stabilize iraq , since the german bundeswehr is already pushed to the limit with thousands of soldiers on peacekeeping duty in afghanistan and elsewhere .
instead , berlin has offered to help train iraqi policemen and take part in other reconstruction projects . “ germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , ” schröder wrote in the new york times . after meeting bush , schröder will also address the u.n. general assembly in a 15 minute speech .
it will be the first speech from a german chancellor to the world body since willy brandt spoke in 1973 . besides reaffirming germany ’ s strong backing of the united nations and its belief in multilateralism to solve international conflicts , schröder is likely to propose revamping the u.n. security council to make it more relevant to the challenges of the 21st century .

chancellor schröder and president bush hope to put transatlantic relations back on track this week with their first one-on-one meeting in 16 months in new york .
but disagreements over iraq are likely to persist . german chancellor gerhard schröder is ostensibly traveling to new york to address the united nations general assembly and celebrate the 30th anniversary of german u.n. membership , but few observers doubt that the most important part of his three-day trip will be a 30 minute meeting with u.s. president george bush on wednesday . the encounter will be the first time the two leaders have held bilateral talks since they fell out over the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as one of the most vocal critics of the war , schröder has long been considered a persona non grata for bush . bush is said to have been not only angered by schröder ’ s decision to use anti-war rhetoric to boost his flagging reelection campaign last year , but also by comments from a later sacked german cabinet member that said bush was using foreign conflicts to distract from domestic problems just as adolph hitler did . thawing relations but there have been increasing signs of a thaw in german-american relations in recent weeks and the meeting in new york will underline that bush is perhaps ready to put his differences with schröder aside in order to improve ties between the two countries . in an interview with fox news on monday evening bush expressed understanding for germany ’ s anti-war position and the pacifism that grew out of the country ’ s experiences in world war ii .
he said he looked forward to “ substantive talks ” with schröder and also praised germany ’ s “ active role ” in afghanistan .
“ i appreciate this support , ” bush said . as the u.s. costs and casualties in postwar iraq continue to mount , bush has been compelled to return to the united nations in order to seek international help in stabilizing the country .
he is hoping the u.n. security council will agree to a new resolution that would encourage more nations to send peacekeepers . schröder , who is particularly keen to end the bad blood with the grudge-holding texan , is likely hoping to mediate between bush and other war opponents including french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
after talking with bush , schröder will meet with the french and russian leaders later on wednesday in new york . as schröder ’ s left berlin on monday , a german government official was at pains to say the trilateral summit was not an attempt to form renewed opposition to washington .
“ it ’ s definitely not signaling an opposing axis to the cooperation with the usa , ” the official told reporters being briefed on the chancellor ’ s trip .
“ germany certainly doesn ’ t see itself as an opposing pole to the united states . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and while hosting a three-way summit with france and britain in berlin over the weekend , schröder appeared to take the middle ground between chirac and staunch u.s. ally british prime minister tony blair . in an editorial published in the new york times on friday , schröder said germany was prepared to share the burden in iraq .
“ it is true that germany and the united states disagreed on how best to deal with saddam hussein 's regime .
there is no point in continuing this debate , ” schröder wrote .
“ we should now look toward the future .
we must work together to win the peace . ” pushing for a stronger u.n. role but schröder ’ s desire to make amends with bush doesn ’ t mean he will likely back away from german and french demands for a stronger role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq .
both countries are pushing for a speedy transition from u.s. occupation to iraqi sovereignty , but washington has so far dismissed a quick transfer of power as unrealistic . schröder has also made clear the united states can not expect berlin to send troops to help stabilize iraq , since the german bundeswehr is already pushed to the limit with thousands of soldiers on peacekeeping duty in afghanistan and elsewhere .
instead , berlin has offered to help train iraqi policemen and take part in other reconstruction projects . “ germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , ” schröder wrote in the new york times . after meeting bush , schröder will also address the u.n. general assembly in a 15 minute speech .
it will be the first speech from a german chancellor to the world body since willy brandt spoke in 1973 . besides reaffirming germany ’ s strong backing of the united nations and its belief in multilateralism to solve international conflicts , schröder is likely to propose revamping the u.n. security council to make it more relevant to the challenges of the 21st century .

with nato locked in internal strife , jaap de hoop scheffer of the netherlands is conflict-free choice as the new secretary general of the alliance . jaap de hoop scheffer , a christian democrat from the netherlands , was among the first to speak out in favor of the united states proceeding in the war against iraq without a united nations mandate .
though in contrast to his counterparts in spain , italy and britain he was barely audible in the cacophony of european voices , his " yes " went down well in washington . the lawyer , who is seen as a bit of a bore in his native holland consistently stresses the importance of europe in the alliance and the role it has to play in ensuring nato is equipped to deal with future issues .
the new candidate is also in favor of a particular military role , which pleases both the " old " and " new " europeans , as u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld dubbed those nations opposed to and in favor of the u.s. stance , respectively . clever mediator hoop scheffer 's political contemporaries speak highly of his outstanding ability to forge compromises and the skill with which he balances on diplomatic tightropes .
his one-time superior , the former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , which is currently a much needed quality back at nato headquarters .
gone is the cold war era when a nato leader could give off a mere growl to keep the warsaw pact in check .
these days the top diplomat needs a honed dove-like coo if he is to keep the illustrious 17 , soon to be 26 , member nations on course , and succeed at building the apparently necessary maze of bridges between the two sides of the atlantic . the u.s. , which is undoubtedly the greatest military might in the alliance , sees nato as a kind of toolbox to be used in the handling of missions such as that of international security troops in afghanistan .
on the other side of the coin there is europe which favors an independent military role , and the new alliance leader will have to negotiate between these two poles . a harmless leader overall , the relative ease with which jaap de hoop scheffer was elected to head up the alliance is an indication that the meaning of the transatlantic alliance is no longer such that london , paris , berlin or london felt it worth igniting a full-scale row over personnel issues . de hoop scheffer will harm no one , although france uttered some initial skepticism about the man who was reported to have an excellent relationship to u.s. president george w. bush .
that particular rumor seeped out into the world when , during an interview with the u.s. vice president dick cheney at the start of september , de hoop scheffer was spontaneously joined by the president himself as he coincidentally entered the room and sat down to join in .
paris was soon soothed into giving the dutch man a chance with news that de hoop scheffer is not only in favor of a strong europe , but also speaks fluent french , and even considers watching french movies one of his hobbies . back home in the netherlands , nato 's new leader 's own political party had refused to let him run as a candidate for prime minister on the grounds that his charisma was simply not up to the job .
but jan peter balkenende who ultimately led the christian democrats to election victory rewarded his political contemporary with the post of foreign minister . now both de hoop scheffer and the netherlands are being rewarded again , this time for remaining faithful to the u.s. , whose leaders evidently do n't count charisma as a prerequisite for the job . bernd riegert is deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch foreign minister slated to head nato career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term .

though in contrast to his counterparts in spain , italy and britain he was barely audible in the cacophony of european voices , his " yes " went down well in washington . the lawyer , who is seen as a bit of a bore in his native holland consistently stresses the importance of europe in the alliance and the role it has to play in ensuring nato is equipped to deal with future issues .
the new candidate is also in favor of a particular military role , which pleases both the " old " and " new " europeans , as u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld dubbed those nations opposed to and in favor of the u.s. stance , respectively . clever mediator hoop scheffer 's political contemporaries speak highly of his outstanding ability to forge compromises and the skill with which he balances on diplomatic tightropes .
his one-time superior , the former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , which is currently a much needed quality back at nato headquarters .
gone is the cold war era when a nato leader could give off a mere growl to keep the warsaw pact in check .
these days the top diplomat needs a honed dove-like coo if he is to keep the illustrious 17 , soon to be 26 , member nations on course , and succeed at building the apparently necessary maze of bridges between the two sides of the atlantic . the u.s. , which is undoubtedly the greatest military might in the alliance , sees nato as a kind of toolbox to be used in the handling of missions such as that of international security troops in afghanistan .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .
but since becoming bundesliga champion in 2002 , the club has fallen on hard times .
last year the team only managed third place and this season dortmund failed to qualify for the lucrative and prestigious champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . as the only bundesliga club listed on the stock exchange , losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
in an effort to help its finances , the club announced on monday that the players had agreed to take a 20 percent pay cut , should the team not bring in the necessary revenue by making it to the uefa cup and bundesliga finals . but the show of solidarity by the players is unlikely to deter eichel or his boss and known soccer fan chancellor gerhard schröder from revamping the rules for weekend shift tax allowances . “ the chancellor is in complete agreement with me that this situation is untenable , but that lower-income earners – for whom this law was originally meant – shouldn ’ t be penalized , ” said eichel . schröder ’ s government , strapped for cash itself these days , is extremely aware that germans will have little sympathy for millionaire soccer stars and their big-business clubs as towns and cities across the country are being forced to close swimming pools , fire policemen and cut back on services due to a shortage of tax revenues . outrage over " florida rolf " the drive to change the tax allowance rules for well-paid athletes comes on the heels of broad public outrage that the german social security system was paying welfare to some citizens that were living abroad .
one recipient in particular , a so-called “ florida rolf ” whose apartment in miami is paid for by german taxpayers , became a lighting rod for criticism over how social security is misused . after smelling blood over dortmund ’ s tax plans , eichel may be inclined to go after other sports that are even more flagrant in their creative use of germany ’ s welfare system .
ice hockey and basketball teams frequently allow their players to receive unemployment for the two to three months out of the year that there are no matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be on the dole ?
jürgen leister , a lawyer who represents the interests of sport professionals within the services trade union verdi , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the practice was also completely legal .
“ it does make me a little queasy , but that ’ s the law , ” he told the paper . even worse , although players often have only one-season contracts , many have already negotiated options for extending them for the following year .
leister said the players only needed to be reachable by the labor office while they were collecting dole payments that frequently total around € 3,000 a month . “ but when was the last time you heard of a pro getting a job via a placement center ? ”

a controversial software patent directive up for a vote in the european parliament has stirred up intense debate .
critics claim the ruling would stifle innovation and put smaller software companies out of business . a vote on the proposed guidelines , called the directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions , has already been delayed twice due to impassioned protests by backers of open-source software .
they say passage of the regulation would have dire consequences for newcomers in the market and developers of free software products .
the draft directive , which has been through 120 amendments , is being debated on tuesday in the parliament and is expected to come to a vote on wednesday .
in most eu countries , software is treated in the same way as the written word and receives copyright protection .
the new guidelines seek to introduce patenting and its proponents say it will harmonize laws that currently differ across eu states .
but critics have lashed out at the proposal , saying it only benefits larger companies and is a job killer .
smaller companies , which are often the most innovative , will suffer the most , according to jeremy newton of the law firm nabarro nathanson .
“ to go out and seek patent protection is costly and very demanding .
small companies will say , ‘ we can ’ t afford this protection . ’
that is a fact of life , ” he told vnunet.com , a technology news website .
two of the world ’ s most renowned figures in the open-source community , linus torvalds and alan cox , have written an open letter to the european parliament urging it to reject the proposal .
“ unlike traditional patents , software patents do not encourage innovation and r & d. quite the contrary , ” they wrote .
torvalds invented the linux basic core and cox is one of the most influential linux developers .
linux is a operating system similar to microsoft windows , whose source code is available to everyone free of charge .
it has become a formidable force in the software industry , but software patents could threaten its open-source development model .
a clearer framework the british mep who introduced the directive last year , arlene mccarthy , defended the proposed guidelines on tuesday in strasbourg , seat of the european parliament , saying it would help protect scientists and companies against competition from american software firms and make the legal framework around computer-related patents more consistent and understandable .
the german federation of information , telecommunication and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- has come out in support of the proposed rules , arguing smaller firms will benefit by protecting their inventions with patents .
“ innovation costs time and effort .
a patent will enable companies to regain some of that investment , ” susanne schopf , head of bitkom ’ s legal protection department , told german television .
according to the directive ’ s backers , more than 20,000 computer-related patents have already been issued on software developments in the eu .
they say the 120 amendments that have made to the draft guidelines since its introduction ensure that only inventions that represent significant technical developments are eligible for patents .
“ u.s.-style mess ” critics such as torvalds and cox , however , say the directive is worded in such a way that virtually any software or electronic business process could be patented , which is already the case in the u.s.
“ in principle we are in favor of harmonisation , but not so that it goes into a u.s.-style mess , ” john holden , senior research analyst at butler group , told vnunet.com.
but he added that patent legislation has not stopped innovation in the u.s. computer scientists , software developers and representatives of small and medium-sized companies across the eu have expressed concern over the proposed change in the law .
last month , a group of 12 leading economists also urged the european parliament to reject the directive , warning that it could produce “ extensive portfolios of software patents ” that favor large corporations . “ while some small and medium-sized firms will be able to prosper in this environment , many will not , ” the letter said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de linux penguins invade germany in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system .

they say passage of the regulation would have dire consequences for newcomers in the market and developers of free software products .
the draft directive , which has been through 120 amendments , is being debated on tuesday in the parliament and is expected to come to a vote on wednesday .
in most eu countries , software is treated in the same way as the written word and receives copyright protection .
the new guidelines seek to introduce patenting and its proponents say it will harmonize laws that currently differ across eu states .
but critics have lashed out at the proposal , saying it only benefits larger companies and is a job killer .
smaller companies , which are often the most innovative , will suffer the most , according to jeremy newton of the law firm nabarro nathanson .
“ to go out and seek patent protection is costly and very demanding .
small companies will say , ‘ we can ’ t afford this protection . ’
that is a fact of life , ” he told vnunet.com , a technology news website .
two of the world ’ s most renowned figures in the open-source community , linus torvalds and alan cox , have written an open letter to the european parliament urging it to reject the proposal .
“ unlike traditional patents , software patents do not encourage innovation and r & d. quite the contrary , ” they wrote .
torvalds invented the linux basic core and cox is one of the most influential linux developers .
linux is a operating system similar to microsoft windows , whose source code is available to everyone free of charge .
it has become a formidable force in the software industry , but software patents could threaten its open-source development model .
a clearer framework the british mep who introduced the directive last year , arlene mccarthy , defended the proposed guidelines on tuesday in strasbourg , seat of the european parliament , saying it would help protect scientists and companies against competition from american software firms and make the legal framework around computer-related patents more consistent and understandable .
the german federation of information , telecommunication and new media -lrb- bitkom -rrb- has come out in support of the proposed rules , arguing smaller firms will benefit by protecting their inventions with patents .
“ innovation costs time and effort .
a patent will enable companies to regain some of that investment , ” susanne schopf , head of bitkom ’ s legal protection department , told german television .
according to the directive ’ s backers , more than 20,000 computer-related patents have already been issued on software developments in the eu .
they say the 120 amendments that have made to the draft guidelines since its introduction ensure that only inventions that represent significant technical developments are eligible for patents .
“ u.s.-style mess ” critics such as torvalds and cox , however , say the directive is worded in such a way that virtually any software or electronic business process could be patented , which is already the case in the u.s.
“ in principle we are in favor of harmonisation , but not so that it goes into a u.s.-style mess , ” john holden , senior research analyst at butler group , told vnunet.com.
but he added that patent legislation has not stopped innovation in the u.s. computer scientists , software developers and representatives of small and medium-sized companies across the eu have expressed concern over the proposed change in the law .
last month , a group of 12 leading economists also urged the european parliament to reject the directive , warning that it could produce “ extensive portfolios of software patents ” that favor large corporations . “ while some small and medium-sized firms will be able to prosper in this environment , many will not , ” the letter said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de linux penguins invade germany in a move aimed at increasing security and cutting costs , the german government says it will switch most of its administrative computers from microsoft windows to the linux open-source operating system .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .

with nato locked in internal strife , jaap de hoop scheffer of the netherlands is conflict-free choice as the new secretary general of the alliance . jaap de hoop scheffer , a christian democrat from the netherlands , was among the first to speak out in favor of the united states proceeding in the war against iraq without a united nations mandate .
though in contrast to his counterparts in spain , italy and britain he was barely audible in the cacophony of european voices , his " yes " went down well in washington . the lawyer , who is seen as a bit of a bore in his native holland consistently stresses the importance of europe in the alliance and the role it has to play in ensuring nato is equipped to deal with future issues .
the new candidate is also in favor of a particular military role , which pleases both the " old " and " new " europeans , as u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld dubbed those nations opposed to and in favor of the u.s. stance , respectively . clever mediator hoop scheffer 's political contemporaries speak highly of his outstanding ability to forge compromises and the skill with which he balances on diplomatic tightropes .
his one-time superior , the former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , which is currently a much needed quality back at nato headquarters .
gone is the cold war era when a nato leader could give off a mere growl to keep the warsaw pact in check .
these days the top diplomat needs a honed dove-like coo if he is to keep the illustrious 17 , soon to be 26 , member nations on course , and succeed at building the apparently necessary maze of bridges between the two sides of the atlantic . the u.s. , which is undoubtedly the greatest military might in the alliance , sees nato as a kind of toolbox to be used in the handling of missions such as that of international security troops in afghanistan .
on the other side of the coin there is europe which favors an independent military role , and the new alliance leader will have to negotiate between these two poles . a harmless leader overall , the relative ease with which jaap de hoop scheffer was elected to head up the alliance is an indication that the meaning of the transatlantic alliance is no longer such that london , paris , berlin or london felt it worth igniting a full-scale row over personnel issues . de hoop scheffer will harm no one , although france uttered some initial skepticism about the man who was reported to have an excellent relationship to u.s. president george w. bush .
that particular rumor seeped out into the world when , during an interview with the u.s. vice president dick cheney at the start of september , de hoop scheffer was spontaneously joined by the president himself as he coincidentally entered the room and sat down to join in .
paris was soon soothed into giving the dutch man a chance with news that de hoop scheffer is not only in favor of a strong europe , but also speaks fluent french , and even considers watching french movies one of his hobbies . back home in the netherlands , nato 's new leader 's own political party had refused to let him run as a candidate for prime minister on the grounds that his charisma was simply not up to the job .
but jan peter balkenende who ultimately led the christian democrats to election victory rewarded his political contemporary with the post of foreign minister . now both de hoop scheffer and the netherlands are being rewarded again , this time for remaining faithful to the u.s. , whose leaders evidently do n't count charisma as a prerequisite for the job . bernd riegert is deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch foreign minister slated to head nato career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term .

top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .
but since becoming bundesliga champion in 2002 , the club has fallen on hard times .
last year the team only managed third place and this season dortmund failed to qualify for the lucrative and prestigious champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . as the only bundesliga club listed on the stock exchange , losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
in an effort to help its finances , the club announced on monday that the players had agreed to take a 20 percent pay cut , should the team not bring in the necessary revenue by making it to the uefa cup and bundesliga finals . but the show of solidarity by the players is unlikely to deter eichel or his boss and known soccer fan chancellor gerhard schröder from revamping the rules for weekend shift tax allowances . “ the chancellor is in complete agreement with me that this situation is untenable , but that lower-income earners – for whom this law was originally meant – shouldn ’ t be penalized , ” said eichel . schröder ’ s government , strapped for cash itself these days , is extremely aware that germans will have little sympathy for millionaire soccer stars and their big-business clubs as towns and cities across the country are being forced to close swimming pools , fire policemen and cut back on services due to a shortage of tax revenues . outrage over " florida rolf " the drive to change the tax allowance rules for well-paid athletes comes on the heels of broad public outrage that the german social security system was paying welfare to some citizens that were living abroad .
one recipient in particular , a so-called “ florida rolf ” whose apartment in miami is paid for by german taxpayers , became a lighting rod for criticism over how social security is misused . after smelling blood over dortmund ’ s tax plans , eichel may be inclined to go after other sports that are even more flagrant in their creative use of germany ’ s welfare system .

bremen leads bundesliga at winter break makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch business -pipe- 23.09.2003 tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : borussia dortmund is hoping to squeeze out some tax savings .
top german soccer club borussia dortmund has caused an uproar by planning to use tax breaks for nighttime and weekend work to trim its tax bill .
other sports teams are letting players collect unemployment to save cash . only weeks have passed since german politicians railed against welfare recipients abusing the social security system by being on the dole while living overseas , including sunny florida .
now they have a new target : the country ’ s successful sports teams and their well-paid athletes . the latest ruckus was caused by revelations that soccer club borussia dortmund was planning on saving taxes by taking advantage of a tax break for employees who work during the night or weekend . since many of dortmund ’ s matches are played after 8 p.m. or on weekends and its players ’ salary contracts are net of taxes , the club will lower its tax bill by hundreds of thousands of euros this year .
clubs from hamburg and bremen are also said to be looking into the allowances . although german finance minster hans eichel has admitted the move is perfectly legal , he also said it breaks the spirit of a law intended to make working nights and weekends more palatable to average workers like nurses , bus drivers and the like . “ it ’ s clear to everyone that these tax allowances weren ’ t intended for millionaires , ” eichel told der spiegel magazine in an interview .
“ we want to change the law – it can ’ t stay the way it is . ” no champions league revenue borussia dortmund has long been one of germany ’ s top soccer powers .
but since becoming bundesliga champion in 2002 , the club has fallen on hard times .
last year the team only managed third place and this season dortmund failed to qualify for the lucrative and prestigious champions league , where europe ’ s top-flight teams compete . as the only bundesliga club listed on the stock exchange , losing the estimated € 12 million -lrb- $ 13.8 million -rrb- in revenue from the champions league matches has put dortmund ’ s managers under particular pressure .
in an effort to help its finances , the club announced on monday that the players had agreed to take a 20 percent pay cut , should the team not bring in the necessary revenue by making it to the uefa cup and bundesliga finals . but the show of solidarity by the players is unlikely to deter eichel or his boss and known soccer fan chancellor gerhard schröder from revamping the rules for weekend shift tax allowances . “ the chancellor is in complete agreement with me that this situation is untenable , but that lower-income earners – for whom this law was originally meant – shouldn ’ t be penalized , ” said eichel . schröder ’ s government , strapped for cash itself these days , is extremely aware that germans will have little sympathy for millionaire soccer stars and their big-business clubs as towns and cities across the country are being forced to close swimming pools , fire policemen and cut back on services due to a shortage of tax revenues . outrage over " florida rolf " the drive to change the tax allowance rules for well-paid athletes comes on the heels of broad public outrage that the german social security system was paying welfare to some citizens that were living abroad .
one recipient in particular , a so-called “ florida rolf ” whose apartment in miami is paid for by german taxpayers , became a lighting rod for criticism over how social security is misused . after smelling blood over dortmund ’ s tax plans , eichel may be inclined to go after other sports that are even more flagrant in their creative use of germany ’ s welfare system .
ice hockey and basketball teams frequently allow their players to receive unemployment for the two to three months out of the year that there are no matches . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon to be on the dole ?
jürgen leister , a lawyer who represents the interests of sport professionals within the services trade union verdi , told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the practice was also completely legal .
“ it does make me a little queasy , but that ’ s the law , ” he told the paper . even worse , although players often have only one-season contracts , many have already negotiated options for extending them for the following year .
leister said the players only needed to be reachable by the labor office while they were collecting dole payments that frequently total around € 3,000 a month . “ but when was the last time you heard of a pro getting a job via a placement center ? ”

chancellor schröder and president bush hope to put transatlantic relations back on track this week with their first one-on-one meeting in 16 months in new york .
but disagreements over iraq are likely to persist . german chancellor gerhard schröder is ostensibly traveling to new york to address the united nations general assembly and celebrate the 30th anniversary of german u.n. membership , but few observers doubt that the most important part of his three-day trip will be a 30 minute meeting with u.s. president george bush on wednesday . the encounter will be the first time the two leaders have held bilateral talks since they fell out over the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as one of the most vocal critics of the war , schröder has long been considered a persona non grata for bush . bush is said to have been not only angered by schröder ’ s decision to use anti-war rhetoric to boost his flagging reelection campaign last year , but also by comments from a later sacked german cabinet member that said bush was using foreign conflicts to distract from domestic problems just as adolph hitler did . thawing relations but there have been increasing signs of a thaw in german-american relations in recent weeks and the meeting in new york will underline that bush is perhaps ready to put his differences with schröder aside in order to improve ties between the two countries . in an interview with fox news on monday evening bush expressed understanding for germany ’ s anti-war position and the pacifism that grew out of the country ’ s experiences in world war ii .
he said he looked forward to “ substantive talks ” with schröder and also praised germany ’ s “ active role ” in afghanistan .
“ i appreciate this support , ” bush said . as the u.s. costs and casualties in postwar iraq continue to mount , bush has been compelled to return to the united nations in order to seek international help in stabilizing the country .
he is hoping the u.n. security council will agree to a new resolution that would encourage more nations to send peacekeepers . schröder , who is particularly keen to end the bad blood with the grudge-holding texan , is likely hoping to mediate between bush and other war opponents including french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
after talking with bush , schröder will meet with the french and russian leaders later on wednesday in new york . as schröder ’ s left berlin on monday , a german government official was at pains to say the trilateral summit was not an attempt to form renewed opposition to washington .
“ it ’ s definitely not signaling an opposing axis to the cooperation with the usa , ” the official told reporters being briefed on the chancellor ’ s trip .
“ germany certainly doesn ’ t see itself as an opposing pole to the united states . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and while hosting a three-way summit with france and britain in berlin over the weekend , schröder appeared to take the middle ground between chirac and staunch u.s. ally british prime minister tony blair . in an editorial published in the new york times on friday , schröder said germany was prepared to share the burden in iraq .
“ it is true that germany and the united states disagreed on how best to deal with saddam hussein 's regime .
there is no point in continuing this debate , ” schröder wrote .
“ we should now look toward the future .
we must work together to win the peace . ” pushing for a stronger u.n. role but schröder ’ s desire to make amends with bush doesn ’ t mean he will likely back away from german and french demands for a stronger role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq .
both countries are pushing for a speedy transition from u.s. occupation to iraqi sovereignty , but washington has so far dismissed a quick transfer of power as unrealistic . schröder has also made clear the united states can not expect berlin to send troops to help stabilize iraq , since the german bundeswehr is already pushed to the limit with thousands of soldiers on peacekeeping duty in afghanistan and elsewhere .
instead , berlin has offered to help train iraqi policemen and take part in other reconstruction projects . “ germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , ” schröder wrote in the new york times . after meeting bush , schröder will also address the u.n. general assembly in a 15 minute speech .
it will be the first speech from a german chancellor to the world body since willy brandt spoke in 1973 . besides reaffirming germany ’ s strong backing of the united nations and its belief in multilateralism to solve international conflicts , schröder is likely to propose revamping the u.n. security council to make it more relevant to the challenges of the 21st century .
such changes could include berlin ’ s goal of attaining a permanent german seat on the council . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de berlin summit scores high for attempt at compromise despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise .

but disagreements over iraq are likely to persist . german chancellor gerhard schröder is ostensibly traveling to new york to address the united nations general assembly and celebrate the 30th anniversary of german u.n. membership , but few observers doubt that the most important part of his three-day trip will be a 30 minute meeting with u.s. president george bush on wednesday . the encounter will be the first time the two leaders have held bilateral talks since they fell out over the u.s.-led war to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein .
as one of the most vocal critics of the war , schröder has long been considered a persona non grata for bush . bush is said to have been not only angered by schröder ’ s decision to use anti-war rhetoric to boost his flagging reelection campaign last year , but also by comments from a later sacked german cabinet member that said bush was using foreign conflicts to distract from domestic problems just as adolph hitler did . thawing relations but there have been increasing signs of a thaw in german-american relations in recent weeks and the meeting in new york will underline that bush is perhaps ready to put his differences with schröder aside in order to improve ties between the two countries . in an interview with fox news on monday evening bush expressed understanding for germany ’ s anti-war position and the pacifism that grew out of the country ’ s experiences in world war ii .
he said he looked forward to “ substantive talks ” with schröder and also praised germany ’ s “ active role ” in afghanistan .
“ i appreciate this support , ” bush said . as the u.s. costs and casualties in postwar iraq continue to mount , bush has been compelled to return to the united nations in order to seek international help in stabilizing the country .
he is hoping the u.n. security council will agree to a new resolution that would encourage more nations to send peacekeepers . schröder , who is particularly keen to end the bad blood with the grudge-holding texan , is likely hoping to mediate between bush and other war opponents including french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin .
after talking with bush , schröder will meet with the french and russian leaders later on wednesday in new york . as schröder ’ s left berlin on monday , a german government official was at pains to say the trilateral summit was not an attempt to form renewed opposition to washington .
“ it ’ s definitely not signaling an opposing axis to the cooperation with the usa , ” the official told reporters being briefed on the chancellor ’ s trip .
“ germany certainly doesn ’ t see itself as an opposing pole to the united states . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : and while hosting a three-way summit with france and britain in berlin over the weekend , schröder appeared to take the middle ground between chirac and staunch u.s. ally british prime minister tony blair . in an editorial published in the new york times on friday , schröder said germany was prepared to share the burden in iraq .
“ it is true that germany and the united states disagreed on how best to deal with saddam hussein 's regime .
there is no point in continuing this debate , ” schröder wrote .
“ we should now look toward the future .
we must work together to win the peace . ” pushing for a stronger u.n. role but schröder ’ s desire to make amends with bush doesn ’ t mean he will likely back away from german and french demands for a stronger role for the united nations in the reconstruction of iraq .
both countries are pushing for a speedy transition from u.s. occupation to iraqi sovereignty , but washington has so far dismissed a quick transfer of power as unrealistic . schröder has also made clear the united states can not expect berlin to send troops to help stabilize iraq , since the german bundeswehr is already pushed to the limit with thousands of soldiers on peacekeeping duty in afghanistan and elsewhere .
instead , berlin has offered to help train iraqi policemen and take part in other reconstruction projects . “ germany is willing to provide humanitarian aid , to assist in the civilian and economic reconstruction of iraq and to train iraqi security forces , ” schröder wrote in the new york times . after meeting bush , schröder will also address the u.n. general assembly in a 15 minute speech .
it will be the first speech from a german chancellor to the world body since willy brandt spoke in 1973 . besides reaffirming germany ’ s strong backing of the united nations and its belief in multilateralism to solve international conflicts , schröder is likely to propose revamping the u.n. security council to make it more relevant to the challenges of the 21st century .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 23.09.2003 opinion : nato 's safe choice großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer : new hope for nato ?
with nato locked in internal strife , jaap de hoop scheffer of the netherlands is conflict-free choice as the new secretary general of the alliance . jaap de hoop scheffer , a christian democrat from the netherlands , was among the first to speak out in favor of the united states proceeding in the war against iraq without a united nations mandate .
though in contrast to his counterparts in spain , italy and britain he was barely audible in the cacophony of european voices , his " yes " went down well in washington . the lawyer , who is seen as a bit of a bore in his native holland consistently stresses the importance of europe in the alliance and the role it has to play in ensuring nato is equipped to deal with future issues .
the new candidate is also in favor of a particular military role , which pleases both the " old " and " new " europeans , as u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld dubbed those nations opposed to and in favor of the u.s. stance , respectively . clever mediator hoop scheffer 's political contemporaries speak highly of his outstanding ability to forge compromises and the skill with which he balances on diplomatic tightropes .
his one-time superior , the former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , which is currently a much needed quality back at nato headquarters .
gone is the cold war era when a nato leader could give off a mere growl to keep the warsaw pact in check .
these days the top diplomat needs a honed dove-like coo if he is to keep the illustrious 17 , soon to be 26 , member nations on course , and succeed at building the apparently necessary maze of bridges between the two sides of the atlantic . the u.s. , which is undoubtedly the greatest military might in the alliance , sees nato as a kind of toolbox to be used in the handling of missions such as that of international security troops in afghanistan .
on the other side of the coin there is europe which favors an independent military role , and the new alliance leader will have to negotiate between these two poles . a harmless leader overall , the relative ease with which jaap de hoop scheffer was elected to head up the alliance is an indication that the meaning of the transatlantic alliance is no longer such that london , paris , berlin or london felt it worth igniting a full-scale row over personnel issues . de hoop scheffer will harm no one , although france uttered some initial skepticism about the man who was reported to have an excellent relationship to u.s. president george w. bush .
that particular rumor seeped out into the world when , during an interview with the u.s. vice president dick cheney at the start of september , de hoop scheffer was spontaneously joined by the president himself as he coincidentally entered the room and sat down to join in .
paris was soon soothed into giving the dutch man a chance with news that de hoop scheffer is not only in favor of a strong europe , but also speaks fluent french , and even considers watching french movies one of his hobbies . back home in the netherlands , nato 's new leader 's own political party had refused to let him run as a candidate for prime minister on the grounds that his charisma was simply not up to the job .
but jan peter balkenende who ultimately led the christian democrats to election victory rewarded his political contemporary with the post of foreign minister . now both de hoop scheffer and the netherlands are being rewarded again , this time for remaining faithful to the u.s. , whose leaders evidently do n't count charisma as a prerequisite for the job . bernd riegert is deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch foreign minister slated to head nato career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term .

with nato locked in internal strife , jaap de hoop scheffer of the netherlands is conflict-free choice as the new secretary general of the alliance . jaap de hoop scheffer , a christian democrat from the netherlands , was among the first to speak out in favor of the united states proceeding in the war against iraq without a united nations mandate .
though in contrast to his counterparts in spain , italy and britain he was barely audible in the cacophony of european voices , his " yes " went down well in washington . the lawyer , who is seen as a bit of a bore in his native holland consistently stresses the importance of europe in the alliance and the role it has to play in ensuring nato is equipped to deal with future issues .
the new candidate is also in favor of a particular military role , which pleases both the " old " and " new " europeans , as u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld dubbed those nations opposed to and in favor of the u.s. stance , respectively . clever mediator hoop scheffer 's political contemporaries speak highly of his outstanding ability to forge compromises and the skill with which he balances on diplomatic tightropes .
his one-time superior , the former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , which is currently a much needed quality back at nato headquarters .
gone is the cold war era when a nato leader could give off a mere growl to keep the warsaw pact in check .
these days the top diplomat needs a honed dove-like coo if he is to keep the illustrious 17 , soon to be 26 , member nations on course , and succeed at building the apparently necessary maze of bridges between the two sides of the atlantic . the u.s. , which is undoubtedly the greatest military might in the alliance , sees nato as a kind of toolbox to be used in the handling of missions such as that of international security troops in afghanistan .
on the other side of the coin there is europe which favors an independent military role , and the new alliance leader will have to negotiate between these two poles . a harmless leader overall , the relative ease with which jaap de hoop scheffer was elected to head up the alliance is an indication that the meaning of the transatlantic alliance is no longer such that london , paris , berlin or london felt it worth igniting a full-scale row over personnel issues . de hoop scheffer will harm no one , although france uttered some initial skepticism about the man who was reported to have an excellent relationship to u.s. president george w. bush .
that particular rumor seeped out into the world when , during an interview with the u.s. vice president dick cheney at the start of september , de hoop scheffer was spontaneously joined by the president himself as he coincidentally entered the room and sat down to join in .
paris was soon soothed into giving the dutch man a chance with news that de hoop scheffer is not only in favor of a strong europe , but also speaks fluent french , and even considers watching french movies one of his hobbies . back home in the netherlands , nato 's new leader 's own political party had refused to let him run as a candidate for prime minister on the grounds that his charisma was simply not up to the job .
but jan peter balkenende who ultimately led the christian democrats to election victory rewarded his political contemporary with the post of foreign minister . now both de hoop scheffer and the netherlands are being rewarded again , this time for remaining faithful to the u.s. , whose leaders evidently do n't count charisma as a prerequisite for the job . bernd riegert is deutsche welle 's brussels correspondent . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dutch foreign minister slated to head nato career diplomat jaap de hoop scheffer is likely to take over the nato reins in december after secretary-general george robertson steps down at the end of his four-year term .

with nato locked in internal strife , jaap de hoop scheffer of the netherlands is conflict-free choice as the new secretary general of the alliance . jaap de hoop scheffer , a christian democrat from the netherlands , was among the first to speak out in favor of the united states proceeding in the war against iraq without a united nations mandate .
though in contrast to his counterparts in spain , italy and britain he was barely audible in the cacophony of european voices , his " yes " went down well in washington . the lawyer , who is seen as a bit of a bore in his native holland consistently stresses the importance of europe in the alliance and the role it has to play in ensuring nato is equipped to deal with future issues .
the new candidate is also in favor of a particular military role , which pleases both the " old " and " new " europeans , as u.s. defense minister donald rumsfeld dubbed those nations opposed to and in favor of the u.s. stance , respectively . clever mediator hoop scheffer 's political contemporaries speak highly of his outstanding ability to forge compromises and the skill with which he balances on diplomatic tightropes .
his one-time superior , the former dutch foreign minister hans van den broek once referred to hoop scheffer as a man who was born to walk on egg shells , which is currently a much needed quality back at nato headquarters .
gone is the cold war era when a nato leader could give off a mere growl to keep the warsaw pact in check .
these days the top diplomat needs a honed dove-like coo if he is to keep the illustrious 17 , soon to be 26 , member nations on course , and succeed at building the apparently necessary maze of bridges between the two sides of the atlantic . the u.s. , which is undoubtedly the greatest military might in the alliance , sees nato as a kind of toolbox to be used in the handling of missions such as that of international security troops in afghanistan .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a new exhibition at the domäne dahlem museum in berlin seeks to shed new light on the social phenomenon of fast food . it 's an elemental experience for junk food junkies and provides the chance for them to get their biggest fix yet .
room upon room of exhibits paint the bigger picture of the sometimes delicious , sometimes depressing world of the universal snack bar .
from french fries to pizza " imbissbuden - essen ohne grenzen " -lrb- snack bars - food without frontiers -rrb- is a cooperation between the museum and publicist jon von wetzlar which seeks to explore the architectonic , culinary and sociological effects of these urban anarchists on their surroundings .

the images , which include joints with glaringly green artificial lawns and compulsory high tables , were shot by photographer christoph buckstegen , have been compiled in a book entitled urban anarchisten - die kultur der imbissbude -lrb- urban anarchists - the culture of the snack bar -rrb- .
modest beginnings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to the show 's curators , berlin got its first taste of fast food some 200 years ago when a pioneering foodie opened a cinnamon pretzel stand in the city 's spandau district .
it was then 120 years later that the popular bockwurst sausage made its first fast food appearance , followed by a berlin creation that is still a firm favorite .
the berliner currywurst , sausage smothered in sauce , is like a large frankfurter sausage cut into pieces then doused in tomato ketchup and sprinkled with a generous helping of curry powder .
it was the brainchild of herta heuwer , whose contribution to berlin 's culinary landscape was so highly regarded that a commemorative plaque was erected following her death in 1999 .
even the great pillar of fast food culture , the hamburger , is believed to have its roots in germany . in 1906 an entrepreneur and son of a german immigrant who went by the name of erich playowski , began serving small meatballs covered with melted cheese in white bread at his snack bar next to an ohio football field .
he named them after his home town of hamburg , and a legend was born .
the tradition evolves bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : from pizza to hamburgers , sushi to falafal , the fast food menu is growing all the time .
berlin alone boasts a massive 2,000 fast food stands with representatives from italy , china , japan , turkey , greece , the arab nations and northern africa . nonetheless , the supply never seems to be fully exhausted and , it seems , as long as foreigners continue to knock at germany 's door , berliners will continue to be wooed by a growing array of exotic and greasy taste sensations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bratwurst for the weekend , sir ?

scottish secretary dr bill o 'neill urged ministers to back legislation following a survey into a voluntary charter on smoking in public places .
almost 40 % of businesses - including more than 70 % of bars - said they allowed smoking throughout .
however , deputy health minister tom mccabe welcomed a rise in the number of premises with smoke-free areas .
smoking policies the voluntary charter was agreed between the scottish executive and the leisure industry in may 2000 .
it aims to reduce the number of premises without smoking policies and increase the number of no-smoking areas .
the report said the number of businesses which had introduced smoking policies for the public had risen by 26 % since 1999 .
the survey of 974 pubs , clubs , hotels and other leisure businesses was carried out in january this year .
the bma calls on the scottish executive to dissociate itself publicly from this failed policy and to support legislation for smoke-free public places dr bill o 'neill bma scottish secretary it found that 39 % of those surveyed allowed people to smoke in all areas accessible to the general public , while 43 % restricted smoking and 18 % were completely smoke-free .
almost half the businesses without smoking policies blamed a fear that they would lose custom .
smoking was still allowed throughout 71 % of public houses and bars and 78 % of social clubs .
dr o 'neill said : " the results of this survey provide clear evidence that voluntary measures to protect the public from the effects of passive smoking are failing .
" what is perhaps most worrying is that despite repeated government support for this failed approach , less than half of all businesses surveyed knew about the voluntary charter .
progress made " distressingly more than three quarters of pubs and nearly four in 10 of all scottish leisure industry sites allow smoking throughout . "
he said it was time for " decisive action " in scotland .
" the bma calls on the scottish executive to dissociate itself publicly from this failed policy and to support legislation for smoke-free public places , " he said .
however , mr mccabe welcomed the progress being made under the voluntary charter .
most pubs allowed smoking throughout " i am particularly pleased to note the increase in the number of premises which offer smoke-free areas , " he said .
but he admitted to being " disappointed " that only 11 % of firms in the food and entertainment sector had complied with all the charter 's requirements .
mr mccabe said the executive was conducting a review of the national tobacco control strategy , which would analyse the impact of second-hand smoke .
it was also intended to produce an action plan on smoking which was designed to meet scotland 's needs .
he said : " one part of the wide ranging action plan is the intention to engage in a widespread public dialogue on the issue of smoking in public places .
right direction " we 're ruling nothing out at this stage and an extension of the voluntary approach remains an option .
" we will consult on this , and other possible options , including statutory controls in order to see how we can best achieve to the extension of smoke-free areas in public places , " he said .
lesley hinds , the chairwoman of nhs health scotland , said it was " encouraging " that things were moving in the right direction .

the resignation of olav fjell came after a marathon overnight board meeting lasting into tuesday , and follows the departure of chairman leif terje loeddesoel at the weekend .
just a week earlier , the statoil board had expressed its confidence in mr fjell , who has come under fire for a $ 16m package of incentives paid to consultants linked to iran .
norwegian police suspect the incentives were effectively bribes , aimed at winning contracts in iran .
' a calmer atmosphere ' " this is a sad day , " said statoil chief financial officer inge hansen , who takes over as interim boss .
" i am going to work hard , and work to get the employees with me . "
in a statement , the company said it was " important that a calmer atmosphere be established as quickly as possible in relation to the group , so that statoil 's development can continue . "
statoil would not say what new information led to mr fjell 's decision to step down , so soon after being supported by the board .
the apparent change of heart has led to reports of a split in the board , with some members unsatisfied at the level of disclosure mr fjell made at the earlier meeting .
ups and downs statoil , which was founded in 1972 and partly privatised in 2001 , has a history of management turbulence .
the government sacked the board in 1999 , and the chief executive resigned soon after in a dispute about cost overruns .
his predecessor had also been ousted for failing to control costs .
statoil 's purpose is to explore internationally for oil and gas , as a hedge against domestic supplies running out in norway , currently the world 's third-biggest petroleum exporter .
the company is under considerable pressure to meet high ethical standards in all its international operations .

darren pritchard , from magor near chepstow , says the law should be changed to allow ill people to use the drug to cope with their condition .
on monday , the 35-year-old was cleared after the prosecution offered no evidence in the case at cardiff crown court .
mr pritchard , who broke his neck in an accident 12 years ago and is paralysed from the neck down , said he could not cope without the cannabis .

power and water supplies were disrupted , as winds of up to 140km / h -lrb- 90mph -rrb- and heavy rain caused flooding in coastal resort towns .
marty was about the same strength as hurricane isabel , which hit the us east coast last week , killing at least 28 .
but now marty has been downgraded to a tropical storm , as it continues north-east and out to sea again .
one man was killed in the coastal town of cabo san lucas , when high winds tore the roof off his wooden home .
another man died when a tree fell on his lorry , and a third was reported dead when his car was swept away by a flash flood , with the fate of his passengers unclear .
hundreds of homes have been flooded in the capital of baja california sur state , la paz , where boats were swamped by high waves in the town 's harbour .
the peninsula is popular with american tourists , and a number of hotels had to switch to generators or use candles as power supplies failed .
" it was a horrible , ugly sound .
even though we live in the path of hurricanes , you never get used to that sound , " said wenceslao petit , the head of the civil protection agency in the resort of los cabos .
several thousand people were moved to emergency shelters as marty blew in .
airports were closed , and flights cancelled , and there are now fears of mudslides caused by up to 20cm -lrb- eight inches -rrb- of rain .
marty is the second hurricane to hit baja california in less than month .
at the end of august , hurricane ignacio left two people dead when their car was carried away in a flood-swollen river .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- the small business panel of experts home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : tuesday , 23 september , 2003 , 07:30 gmt 08:30 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version the small business panel of experts a panel of experts on small business answer questions from bbc news online readers .
whether you are worried about growing your company without losing control , or agonising over funding for a new business , our panellists can help you .
following a strong response , bbc news online is publishing several sets of answers to your questions .
we have tried to include as many questions as possible .
anita roddick , founder of the body shop , on the creative retailing of shoes and earning a livelihood .
simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer , talks about positioning a product in relation to a competitor .
david wilkinson , partner at ernst & young , gives the rundown on investing in a friend 's business .
judith rutherford , head of business link for london , provides help on starting up and funding your own business .
peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking , on using overdrafts and setting up in the catering trade .
nigel nicholson , professor , london business school , comments on the vagaries of leadership and motivating a team without pay rises .
david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london , offers help on confidentiality agreements and setting up offshore .
bbc news online will publish the next set of answers from our panel of small business experts on tuesday , 30 september .
question keith moses , england what are the options for growing a business that designs ladies shoes predominantly for early adopters .
currently this business sources materials from italy and undertakes actual production in portugal , which reduces unit production costs by as much as 30 % .
given the difficulty of getting into established uk department stores , we have considered opening our own retail outlet but we were told there was no money to be made from selling shoes .
in the past we considered product placement , celebrity-based advertising , and using agents to serve export markets , but we needed capital injection to move on this .
what options do we have ?
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop lucky you .
this is a product line where you can claim your fame easier than in apparel .
what is on offer in the uk can be really dull or jaw-dropping creative .
camper is a company based in majorca which uses the peasant footwear as inspiration .
learn everything from them .
go on their website , look at their stores and their retail design .
it is a perfect example of how little money you need to pay for interior design in the fashion world .
' there is no money to be made in shoes ' ? ?
hah !
tell that to bata or to prada !
firstly get your product right .
keep it creative , use the soles for messages that turn the whole concept of shoes upside down , like camper does .
design a great catalogue , hawk it around -lrb- without leaving it around -rrb- and then you will find the truth of your products in people 's reactions to them .
if you have got it right , then open up your first wee store , if that provides you all with a good livelihood , then and only then think of the next step .
question sam , uk from conception of the business idea to being up and running , how long did it take anita to go from being in the red to being in the in the black ?
my partner is looking into starting up but we have no idea how long it could take to start making money !
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop it does n't work like that as you keep investing to develop the product or the concept .
why not think this way - will it provide me with a livelihood ?
return to the top question m.f. dossa , sri lanka how important is it to position one 's product , particularly if your major competitor has positioned himself -lrb- successfully -rrb- on value for money i.e. low price ?
but in blind tests -lrb- of fruit drinks -rrb- , my competitor fails miserably -lrb- 90 % prefer my company 's products -rrb- .
how should i communicate with the market place ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer when consumers are faced with a choice of brands , they will position your product relative to the other brands , based on how well they think each product meets their needs .
as positioning is effectively the ranking of your product by consumers , positioning is critical because it will determine whether a consumer will purchase your product or choose a competitor 's .
if you are entering a crowded market , the more distinct your product is and the more that your product has an advantage over the competition , the more attractive its position will be to the consumer and therefore the more likely they will be to buy your product .
the fact that a well-established , major competitor has positioned himself on low price would make it unwise to try to adopt the same positioning .
generally , the more established and bigger a company is , the longer it can sustain a lower price if a price war kicks off .
so , unless you have found a different source , ingredients , or production technique that allows you to sustain a low price , i would n't go head-to-head with them on price .
ideally , the positioning you adopt should also be sustainable so that you reap the benefits of your work for as long as possible .
whatever positioning you adopt , it is essential that you can substantiate it .
it is very unlikely consumers will purchase a product twice if your product claims do n't meet the expectations that they create in the mind of the consumer .
if your product is preferred on taste by 90 % of consumers , you have found a great positioning .
but you are going to have to be able to substantiate a claim like that with independent evidence .
you should also bear in mind that , while it is perfectly legal to make comparative claims against other brands and even name the other brand , the evidence will also have to be able to stand up in court , as i would imagine that large competitors will not think twice about getting involved in lengthy and expensive court case to try to discourage further comparative claims made against them .
an alternative is to make a non-direct comparative claim along the lines of ' the fruit juice preferred by nine out of 10 adults / kids ' -lrb- or whoever the target market is -rrb- .
but this claim will still need to be independently substantiated .
do n't be afraid of substantiating your claims as credibility in advertising is definitely appreciated by consumers !
return to the top question stevie m , uk i am thinking about investing in a pal of mine 's new clothing business .
he 's extremely talented and has good drive and business sense , but this is a gamble and could leave me in a bit of financial trouble if it fails .
what are the biggest traps to look out for when starting out in a venture like this ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young your question suggests that you are not going to be closely involved in running the business .
if that is the case , one trap you may be falling into is to invest more than you can afford to lose in someone else 's company when you have no control over events .
if possible , insist that you have an involvement in decision-making and access to financial information .
then at least you can look out for traps and pitfalls such as : over-reliance on a small number of large customers , or even one - try to spread the risk .
overtrading - growing the business without adequate funding in place to cope with the working capital requirements .
allowing your cost base to build up in anticipation of sales that do not happen - be mean , particularly in the early stages !
failing to manage cash , by not looking ahead to identify forthcoming requirements , not collecting debts quickly enough and not managing creditors - cash is king !
failing to keep the bank informed - keep talking to your funders .
losing control of the business due to a lack of management information - produce simple , timely , sensible information .
building up stocks in anticipation of sales that do not happen - do n't believe too much in your forecasts , they will always be wrong !
failing to meet your customers ' requirements - deliver on time and to the required specification .
failing to allow for the unexpected - keep something in reserve , because the unexpected will happen !
losing key employees - work out who is critical to the business and what you need to do to keep them .
going into the unknown without proper advice - good advice may seem expensive , but it is usually not as expensive as the potential mistake .
dilution - if money runs out and new investment is sought , the new investors have the whip hand and the early investors always lose out .
investing in someone else 's business is risky .
professionals manage a portfolio of investments and they always expect some to go wrong , however much they know about the companies and their industries - they still have others that will be successful .
you are only investing in one business - make sure you can afford for it to go wrong !
return to the top question michael , uk i am trying to start my own business -lrb- which would involve making and selling a number of my own food recipes -rrb- and was hoping you could give me some advice as to how to get the project off the ground , for example , funding the project , marketing and distribution .
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london starting a business is a serious undertaking and should be approached accordingly .
the key is to look before you leap .
although such a brief response ca n't cover all of the issues involved , there are a number of key steps worth noting .
you need to qualify your idea and be sure that it has commercial potential .
you also need to research the market and competitors .
i would advise you to approach a relevant person to be your sounding board as early on in the process as possible .
as you progress down the planning track , you 'll need to work out the vision for your business and its goals and then put together a viable business plan with measurable objectives and financial forecasts .
this will enable you to approach lenders or investors for the capital you need to get the business off the ground .
once you 've got to this stage , you can then look at the forms of business you might adopt -lrb- for example , sole trader , limited company -rrb- .
question tim , uk i have been trying to start my own business for the last two years but find myself in a catch-22 position .
although investors say they like the business plan they are unwilling to invest until we get a commitment from some customers .
however , customers are unwilling to commit until they can see a financially sound company .
how can i get out of this catch-22 position ?
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london there are two funding options that may help resolve your problem .
firstly , the small firms loan guarantee scheme , where 75 % of the value of the loan is underwritten by the government .
this is available through high street banks .
secondly , depending on your business type , location and other factors , there may be specific grants or loans available to you .
many areas in the country run ' access to finance ' schemes under one name or another , usually through the local business link , which help businesses become finance-ready and source funding .
i would suggest contacting your local business link and investigating www.j4b.co.uk for further information .
return to the top question richard armstrong , swaziland we have a small advertising company with six full-time staff and several ' outsourced ' staff .
we have been running for two-and-half years and have never applied for or used an overdraft facility .
our cashflow is okay , though sometimes we do have to do a bit of juggling to get through small crises .
it seems that most large companies use an overdraft facility - we intend on becoming a large company but when is it time to use an overdraft ?
is it necessary at all to use such a service ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking you have already identified some of the key reasons why it is good to have the comfort of an overdraft facility available to your business when you need it .
sooner or later something unexpected is bound come about , which could well be an opportunity rather then something unpleasant and in either event you may require the additional finance quickly .
the point is do n't let the unexpected take you by surprise - the key is flexible financial planning and with the right package you will have your financial armoury in place before you need it .
your bank manager or financial adviser in swaziland should be able to help you to decide on the best options for your business .
questions derek jones , uk i am interested in buying a 12-bedroom pub / hotel in a popular tourist spot .
although it is not trading well at present , i am sure with a fresh outlook the business will thrive .
as i have yet to see accounts , my general question is would a bank , depending on circumstances , be prepared to back this sort of venture ?
i would have about £ 150k to put in and would need to borrow about £ 350k .
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking the banks are always keen to discuss viable business propositions .
i would suggest that your starting point would be to review the company 's accounts and begin to develop your business plan .
if you have no experience in the area , there are many advisers available to assist you with this process .
this will help you to identify for yourself the opportunities and problems with the business , which you will then be able to develop to your advantage .
it is positive that you have a personal contribution to make to the project as this helps demonstrate you commitment to a lender .
you may find the hotel and catering international management association a useful source of information on your sector , www.hcima.org.uk.
return to the top question yury , uk as management and leadership styles vary across cultures and national borders , do you still have a common framework when offering your expertise ?
how do you adapt to local conditions ?
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school you have raised one of the most complex and controversial questions in management science .
i shall try to keep my answer straightforward : 1 -rrb- i believe that the deep drivers of leadership are universal , related to the genetics of character and cognition , but for these to emerge and turn into actual leadership requires a supportive environment and sympathetic culture .
2 -rrb- there are many different kinds of leadership roles , and each requires a different style .
leadership roles also change over time , so must the style of the leader or manager .
3 -rrb- national culture is a set of conditions that affects both 1 -rrb- & 2 -rrb- - how leaders are developed , and the kinds of positions they occupy .
leadership is also concerned with values , and therefore leaders have to be in harmony with the surrounding culture .
the answer to your question is , therefore , yes i do have a framework that would be take too long to explain in detail , but which is based upon : a -rrb- a model of human individual differences and types b -rrb- a model of types of leadership situations and their demands , and c -rrb- ideas about the processes that achieve the best fit between these .
to find out more you 'll have to read my books or come on one of the leadership courses i direct !
question iain humphries , uk how do you motivate a team , group or company when the staff know that they will not receive any training , pay rise , bonus or incentives despite the company making big profits .
please note that the staff work hard and long hours without overtime .
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school in a word - communicate !
i sense a very particular story beneath your brief question , so i can only speak here in the most general terms .
the best businesses create a sense of community in which there is a shared destiny for all members .
this can mean that wealth-sharing is deferred for the sake of business-building investments .
people can accept such a strategy so long as they do n't think they are being treated cynically or exploited .
it is the leadership 's job to create a culture through open communications and trust in which people feel committed , involved , recognised and fairly treated .
if you are the leader , i suggest you call them all together in a ' town hall meeting ' and you confront the issue directly .
give them the recognition for the long hours etc . , pick out for praise as many as deserve it , and explain to them the current state of the business and its future strategic trajectory in terms of what this means for costs , revenues and incentives .
be frank about the problems and challenges , and commit to soliciting their partnership and help in solving them .
get people to voice their immediate current concerns or questions .
if there is something you ca n't answer , commit to a deferred response .
take your people with you .
return to the top question m. forbes , uk i am finalising a business plan and about to approach and recruit two ex-colleagues in an effort to strengthen the management team .
how do i prevent these ex-colleagues from taking my idea and ' going it alone ' ?
n.b. the idea is an internet-based data service , not a physical product where a patent could be obtained .
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london you could insist that they sign a confidentiality and non-competition agreement .
the first part of this would forbid them from going into competition with you for a certain period of time or within a defined geographical region .
the terms of this must not be drafted too widely or the courts may deem it too restrictive and refuse to enforce the promise .
by signing a confidentiality agreement - also known as a non-disclosure agreement or ' nda ' - the other party undertakes not to disclose any confidential information he learns while working with you .
you should be aware that in practice such agreements can be difficult to enforce as it may be hard to prove that the particular information is genuinely confidential -lrb- merely labelling it ' secret ' will not suffice -rrb- or that an individual is using secret information or disclosing it to others .
question richard dance , uk what are the legal or commercial advantages and disadvantages of starting up a company offshore rather than in the uk ?
for example , a base in the isle of man ?
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london the main advantage of trading through an offshore company is the ability to avoid paying tax on your profits .
unfortunately , there is more to trading offshore than just registering your company elsewhere .
for tax purposes , a company is resident in the uk and liable to uk tax if it is registered here .
companies registered in the isle of man -lrb- or any other offshore jurisdiction -rrb- will still be deemed resident in the uk if their ' central management and control ' is exercised in the uk .
it 's not enough just to appoint an offshore nominee and hold board meetings in that country if it 's actually you running the company .
many companies manage to exist offshore and enjoy the benefits of doing so but you should be aware that the rules governing such companies are extremely complicated so take advice before committing yourself .
starting and running an offshore company also costs many times more than it does on the uk mainland .
return to the top the opinions expressed above are those of the panel of experts , not the bbc 's .
the advice is not intended to be definitive and should be used for guidance only .
always seek professional advice for your own particular situation .

bbc news online will publish the next set of answers from our panel of small business experts on tuesday , 30 september .
question keith moses , england what are the options for growing a business that designs ladies shoes predominantly for early adopters .
currently this business sources materials from italy and undertakes actual production in portugal , which reduces unit production costs by as much as 30 % .
given the difficulty of getting into established uk department stores , we have considered opening our own retail outlet but we were told there was no money to be made from selling shoes .
in the past we considered product placement , celebrity-based advertising , and using agents to serve export markets , but we needed capital injection to move on this .
what options do we have ?
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop lucky you .
this is a product line where you can claim your fame easier than in apparel .
what is on offer in the uk can be really dull or jaw-dropping creative .
camper is a company based in majorca which uses the peasant footwear as inspiration .
learn everything from them .
go on their website , look at their stores and their retail design .
it is a perfect example of how little money you need to pay for interior design in the fashion world .
' there is no money to be made in shoes ' ? ?
hah !
tell that to bata or to prada !
firstly get your product right .
keep it creative , use the soles for messages that turn the whole concept of shoes upside down , like camper does .
design a great catalogue , hawk it around -lrb- without leaving it around -rrb- and then you will find the truth of your products in people 's reactions to them .
if you have got it right , then open up your first wee store , if that provides you all with a good livelihood , then and only then think of the next step .
question sam , uk from conception of the business idea to being up and running , how long did it take anita to go from being in the red to being in the in the black ?
my partner is looking into starting up but we have no idea how long it could take to start making money !
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop it does n't work like that as you keep investing to develop the product or the concept .
why not think this way - will it provide me with a livelihood ?
return to the top question m.f. dossa , sri lanka how important is it to position one 's product , particularly if your major competitor has positioned himself -lrb- successfully -rrb- on value for money i.e. low price ?
but in blind tests -lrb- of fruit drinks -rrb- , my competitor fails miserably -lrb- 90 % prefer my company 's products -rrb- .
how should i communicate with the market place ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer when consumers are faced with a choice of brands , they will position your product relative to the other brands , based on how well they think each product meets their needs .
as positioning is effectively the ranking of your product by consumers , positioning is critical because it will determine whether a consumer will purchase your product or choose a competitor 's .
if you are entering a crowded market , the more distinct your product is and the more that your product has an advantage over the competition , the more attractive its position will be to the consumer and therefore the more likely they will be to buy your product .
the fact that a well-established , major competitor has positioned himself on low price would make it unwise to try to adopt the same positioning .
generally , the more established and bigger a company is , the longer it can sustain a lower price if a price war kicks off .
so , unless you have found a different source , ingredients , or production technique that allows you to sustain a low price , i would n't go head-to-head with them on price .
ideally , the positioning you adopt should also be sustainable so that you reap the benefits of your work for as long as possible .
whatever positioning you adopt , it is essential that you can substantiate it .
it is very unlikely consumers will purchase a product twice if your product claims do n't meet the expectations that they create in the mind of the consumer .
if your product is preferred on taste by 90 % of consumers , you have found a great positioning .
but you are going to have to be able to substantiate a claim like that with independent evidence .
you should also bear in mind that , while it is perfectly legal to make comparative claims against other brands and even name the other brand , the evidence will also have to be able to stand up in court , as i would imagine that large competitors will not think twice about getting involved in lengthy and expensive court case to try to discourage further comparative claims made against them .
an alternative is to make a non-direct comparative claim along the lines of ' the fruit juice preferred by nine out of 10 adults / kids ' -lrb- or whoever the target market is -rrb- .
but this claim will still need to be independently substantiated .
do n't be afraid of substantiating your claims as credibility in advertising is definitely appreciated by consumers !
return to the top question stevie m , uk i am thinking about investing in a pal of mine 's new clothing business .
he 's extremely talented and has good drive and business sense , but this is a gamble and could leave me in a bit of financial trouble if it fails .
what are the biggest traps to look out for when starting out in a venture like this ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young your question suggests that you are not going to be closely involved in running the business .
if that is the case , one trap you may be falling into is to invest more than you can afford to lose in someone else 's company when you have no control over events .
if possible , insist that you have an involvement in decision-making and access to financial information .
then at least you can look out for traps and pitfalls such as : over-reliance on a small number of large customers , or even one - try to spread the risk .
overtrading - growing the business without adequate funding in place to cope with the working capital requirements .
allowing your cost base to build up in anticipation of sales that do not happen - be mean , particularly in the early stages !
failing to manage cash , by not looking ahead to identify forthcoming requirements , not collecting debts quickly enough and not managing creditors - cash is king !
failing to keep the bank informed - keep talking to your funders .
losing control of the business due to a lack of management information - produce simple , timely , sensible information .
building up stocks in anticipation of sales that do not happen - do n't believe too much in your forecasts , they will always be wrong !
failing to meet your customers ' requirements - deliver on time and to the required specification .
failing to allow for the unexpected - keep something in reserve , because the unexpected will happen !
losing key employees - work out who is critical to the business and what you need to do to keep them .
going into the unknown without proper advice - good advice may seem expensive , but it is usually not as expensive as the potential mistake .
dilution - if money runs out and new investment is sought , the new investors have the whip hand and the early investors always lose out .
investing in someone else 's business is risky .
professionals manage a portfolio of investments and they always expect some to go wrong , however much they know about the companies and their industries - they still have others that will be successful .
you are only investing in one business - make sure you can afford for it to go wrong !
return to the top question michael , uk i am trying to start my own business -lrb- which would involve making and selling a number of my own food recipes -rrb- and was hoping you could give me some advice as to how to get the project off the ground , for example , funding the project , marketing and distribution .
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london starting a business is a serious undertaking and should be approached accordingly .
the key is to look before you leap .
although such a brief response ca n't cover all of the issues involved , there are a number of key steps worth noting .
you need to qualify your idea and be sure that it has commercial potential .
you also need to research the market and competitors .
i would advise you to approach a relevant person to be your sounding board as early on in the process as possible .
as you progress down the planning track , you 'll need to work out the vision for your business and its goals and then put together a viable business plan with measurable objectives and financial forecasts .
this will enable you to approach lenders or investors for the capital you need to get the business off the ground .
once you 've got to this stage , you can then look at the forms of business you might adopt -lrb- for example , sole trader , limited company -rrb- .
question tim , uk i have been trying to start my own business for the last two years but find myself in a catch-22 position .
although investors say they like the business plan they are unwilling to invest until we get a commitment from some customers .
however , customers are unwilling to commit until they can see a financially sound company .
how can i get out of this catch-22 position ?
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london there are two funding options that may help resolve your problem .
firstly , the small firms loan guarantee scheme , where 75 % of the value of the loan is underwritten by the government .
this is available through high street banks .
secondly , depending on your business type , location and other factors , there may be specific grants or loans available to you .
many areas in the country run ' access to finance ' schemes under one name or another , usually through the local business link , which help businesses become finance-ready and source funding .
i would suggest contacting your local business link and investigating www.j4b.co.uk for further information .
return to the top question richard armstrong , swaziland we have a small advertising company with six full-time staff and several ' outsourced ' staff .
we have been running for two-and-half years and have never applied for or used an overdraft facility .
our cashflow is okay , though sometimes we do have to do a bit of juggling to get through small crises .
it seems that most large companies use an overdraft facility - we intend on becoming a large company but when is it time to use an overdraft ?
is it necessary at all to use such a service ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking you have already identified some of the key reasons why it is good to have the comfort of an overdraft facility available to your business when you need it .
sooner or later something unexpected is bound come about , which could well be an opportunity rather then something unpleasant and in either event you may require the additional finance quickly .
the point is do n't let the unexpected take you by surprise - the key is flexible financial planning and with the right package you will have your financial armoury in place before you need it .
your bank manager or financial adviser in swaziland should be able to help you to decide on the best options for your business .
questions derek jones , uk i am interested in buying a 12-bedroom pub / hotel in a popular tourist spot .
although it is not trading well at present , i am sure with a fresh outlook the business will thrive .
as i have yet to see accounts , my general question is would a bank , depending on circumstances , be prepared to back this sort of venture ?
i would have about £ 150k to put in and would need to borrow about £ 350k .
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking the banks are always keen to discuss viable business propositions .
i would suggest that your starting point would be to review the company 's accounts and begin to develop your business plan .
if you have no experience in the area , there are many advisers available to assist you with this process .
this will help you to identify for yourself the opportunities and problems with the business , which you will then be able to develop to your advantage .
it is positive that you have a personal contribution to make to the project as this helps demonstrate you commitment to a lender .
you may find the hotel and catering international management association a useful source of information on your sector , www.hcima.org.uk.
return to the top question yury , uk as management and leadership styles vary across cultures and national borders , do you still have a common framework when offering your expertise ?
how do you adapt to local conditions ?
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school you have raised one of the most complex and controversial questions in management science .
i shall try to keep my answer straightforward : 1 -rrb- i believe that the deep drivers of leadership are universal , related to the genetics of character and cognition , but for these to emerge and turn into actual leadership requires a supportive environment and sympathetic culture .
2 -rrb- there are many different kinds of leadership roles , and each requires a different style .
leadership roles also change over time , so must the style of the leader or manager .
3 -rrb- national culture is a set of conditions that affects both 1 -rrb- & 2 -rrb- - how leaders are developed , and the kinds of positions they occupy .
leadership is also concerned with values , and therefore leaders have to be in harmony with the surrounding culture .
the answer to your question is , therefore , yes i do have a framework that would be take too long to explain in detail , but which is based upon : a -rrb- a model of human individual differences and types b -rrb- a model of types of leadership situations and their demands , and c -rrb- ideas about the processes that achieve the best fit between these .
to find out more you 'll have to read my books or come on one of the leadership courses i direct !
question iain humphries , uk how do you motivate a team , group or company when the staff know that they will not receive any training , pay rise , bonus or incentives despite the company making big profits .
please note that the staff work hard and long hours without overtime .
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school in a word - communicate !
i sense a very particular story beneath your brief question , so i can only speak here in the most general terms .
the best businesses create a sense of community in which there is a shared destiny for all members .
this can mean that wealth-sharing is deferred for the sake of business-building investments .
people can accept such a strategy so long as they do n't think they are being treated cynically or exploited .
it is the leadership 's job to create a culture through open communications and trust in which people feel committed , involved , recognised and fairly treated .
if you are the leader , i suggest you call them all together in a ' town hall meeting ' and you confront the issue directly .
give them the recognition for the long hours etc . , pick out for praise as many as deserve it , and explain to them the current state of the business and its future strategic trajectory in terms of what this means for costs , revenues and incentives .
be frank about the problems and challenges , and commit to soliciting their partnership and help in solving them .
get people to voice their immediate current concerns or questions .
if there is something you ca n't answer , commit to a deferred response .
take your people with you .
return to the top question m. forbes , uk i am finalising a business plan and about to approach and recruit two ex-colleagues in an effort to strengthen the management team .
how do i prevent these ex-colleagues from taking my idea and ' going it alone ' ?
n.b. the idea is an internet-based data service , not a physical product where a patent could be obtained .
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london you could insist that they sign a confidentiality and non-competition agreement .
the first part of this would forbid them from going into competition with you for a certain period of time or within a defined geographical region .
the terms of this must not be drafted too widely or the courts may deem it too restrictive and refuse to enforce the promise .
by signing a confidentiality agreement - also known as a non-disclosure agreement or ' nda ' - the other party undertakes not to disclose any confidential information he learns while working with you .
you should be aware that in practice such agreements can be difficult to enforce as it may be hard to prove that the particular information is genuinely confidential -lrb- merely labelling it ' secret ' will not suffice -rrb- or that an individual is using secret information or disclosing it to others .
question richard dance , uk what are the legal or commercial advantages and disadvantages of starting up a company offshore rather than in the uk ?
for example , a base in the isle of man ?
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london the main advantage of trading through an offshore company is the ability to avoid paying tax on your profits .
unfortunately , there is more to trading offshore than just registering your company elsewhere .
for tax purposes , a company is resident in the uk and liable to uk tax if it is registered here .
companies registered in the isle of man -lrb- or any other offshore jurisdiction -rrb- will still be deemed resident in the uk if their ' central management and control ' is exercised in the uk .
it 's not enough just to appoint an offshore nominee and hold board meetings in that country if it 's actually you running the company .
many companies manage to exist offshore and enjoy the benefits of doing so but you should be aware that the rules governing such companies are extremely complicated so take advice before committing yourself .
starting and running an offshore company also costs many times more than it does on the uk mainland .
return to the top the opinions expressed above are those of the panel of experts , not the bbc 's .
the advice is not intended to be definitive and should be used for guidance only .
always seek professional advice for your own particular situation .

my partner is looking into starting up but we have no idea how long it could take to start making money !
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop it does n't work like that as you keep investing to develop the product or the concept .
why not think this way - will it provide me with a livelihood ?
return to the top question m.f. dossa , sri lanka how important is it to position one 's product , particularly if your major competitor has positioned himself -lrb- successfully -rrb- on value for money i.e. low price ?
but in blind tests -lrb- of fruit drinks -rrb- , my competitor fails miserably -lrb- 90 % prefer my company 's products -rrb- .
how should i communicate with the market place ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer when consumers are faced with a choice of brands , they will position your product relative to the other brands , based on how well they think each product meets their needs .
as positioning is effectively the ranking of your product by consumers , positioning is critical because it will determine whether a consumer will purchase your product or choose a competitor 's .
if you are entering a crowded market , the more distinct your product is and the more that your product has an advantage over the competition , the more attractive its position will be to the consumer and therefore the more likely they will be to buy your product .
the fact that a well-established , major competitor has positioned himself on low price would make it unwise to try to adopt the same positioning .

but this claim will still need to be independently substantiated .
do n't be afraid of substantiating your claims as credibility in advertising is definitely appreciated by consumers !
return to the top question stevie m , uk i am thinking about investing in a pal of mine 's new clothing business .
he 's extremely talented and has good drive and business sense , but this is a gamble and could leave me in a bit of financial trouble if it fails .
what are the biggest traps to look out for when starting out in a venture like this ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young your question suggests that you are not going to be closely involved in running the business .
if that is the case , one trap you may be falling into is to invest more than you can afford to lose in someone else 's company when you have no control over events .
if possible , insist that you have an involvement in decision-making and access to financial information .
then at least you can look out for traps and pitfalls such as : over-reliance on a small number of large customers , or even one - try to spread the risk .
overtrading - growing the business without adequate funding in place to cope with the working capital requirements .
allowing your cost base to build up in anticipation of sales that do not happen - be mean , particularly in the early stages !
failing to manage cash , by not looking ahead to identify forthcoming requirements , not collecting debts quickly enough and not managing creditors - cash is king !
failing to keep the bank informed - keep talking to your funders .
losing control of the business due to a lack of management information - produce simple , timely , sensible information .
building up stocks in anticipation of sales that do not happen - do n't believe too much in your forecasts , they will always be wrong !
failing to meet your customers ' requirements - deliver on time and to the required specification .
failing to allow for the unexpected - keep something in reserve , because the unexpected will happen !
losing key employees - work out who is critical to the business and what you need to do to keep them .
going into the unknown without proper advice - good advice may seem expensive , but it is usually not as expensive as the potential mistake .
dilution - if money runs out and new investment is sought , the new investors have the whip hand and the early investors always lose out .
investing in someone else 's business is risky .
professionals manage a portfolio of investments and they always expect some to go wrong , however much they know about the companies and their industries - they still have others that will be successful .
you are only investing in one business - make sure you can afford for it to go wrong !
return to the top question michael , uk i am trying to start my own business -lrb- which would involve making and selling a number of my own food recipes -rrb- and was hoping you could give me some advice as to how to get the project off the ground , for example , funding the project , marketing and distribution .
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london starting a business is a serious undertaking and should be approached accordingly .
the key is to look before you leap .
although such a brief response ca n't cover all of the issues involved , there are a number of key steps worth noting .
you need to qualify your idea and be sure that it has commercial potential .
you also need to research the market and competitors .
i would advise you to approach a relevant person to be your sounding board as early on in the process as possible .
as you progress down the planning track , you 'll need to work out the vision for your business and its goals and then put together a viable business plan with measurable objectives and financial forecasts .
this will enable you to approach lenders or investors for the capital you need to get the business off the ground .
once you 've got to this stage , you can then look at the forms of business you might adopt -lrb- for example , sole trader , limited company -rrb- .
question tim , uk i have been trying to start my own business for the last two years but find myself in a catch-22 position .
although investors say they like the business plan they are unwilling to invest until we get a commitment from some customers .
however , customers are unwilling to commit until they can see a financially sound company .
how can i get out of this catch-22 position ?
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london there are two funding options that may help resolve your problem .
firstly , the small firms loan guarantee scheme , where 75 % of the value of the loan is underwritten by the government .
this is available through high street banks .
secondly , depending on your business type , location and other factors , there may be specific grants or loans available to you .
many areas in the country run ' access to finance ' schemes under one name or another , usually through the local business link , which help businesses become finance-ready and source funding .
i would suggest contacting your local business link and investigating www.j4b.co.uk for further information .
return to the top question richard armstrong , swaziland we have a small advertising company with six full-time staff and several ' outsourced ' staff .
we have been running for two-and-half years and have never applied for or used an overdraft facility .
our cashflow is okay , though sometimes we do have to do a bit of juggling to get through small crises .
it seems that most large companies use an overdraft facility - we intend on becoming a large company but when is it time to use an overdraft ?
is it necessary at all to use such a service ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking you have already identified some of the key reasons why it is good to have the comfort of an overdraft facility available to your business when you need it .
sooner or later something unexpected is bound come about , which could well be an opportunity rather then something unpleasant and in either event you may require the additional finance quickly .
the point is do n't let the unexpected take you by surprise - the key is flexible financial planning and with the right package you will have your financial armoury in place before you need it .
your bank manager or financial adviser in swaziland should be able to help you to decide on the best options for your business .
questions derek jones , uk i am interested in buying a 12-bedroom pub / hotel in a popular tourist spot .
although it is not trading well at present , i am sure with a fresh outlook the business will thrive .
as i have yet to see accounts , my general question is would a bank , depending on circumstances , be prepared to back this sort of venture ?
i would have about £ 150k to put in and would need to borrow about £ 350k .
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking the banks are always keen to discuss viable business propositions .
i would suggest that your starting point would be to review the company 's accounts and begin to develop your business plan .
if you have no experience in the area , there are many advisers available to assist you with this process .
this will help you to identify for yourself the opportunities and problems with the business , which you will then be able to develop to your advantage .
it is positive that you have a personal contribution to make to the project as this helps demonstrate you commitment to a lender .
you may find the hotel and catering international management association a useful source of information on your sector , www.hcima.org.uk.
return to the top question yury , uk as management and leadership styles vary across cultures and national borders , do you still have a common framework when offering your expertise ?
how do you adapt to local conditions ?
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school you have raised one of the most complex and controversial questions in management science .
i shall try to keep my answer straightforward : 1 -rrb- i believe that the deep drivers of leadership are universal , related to the genetics of character and cognition , but for these to emerge and turn into actual leadership requires a supportive environment and sympathetic culture .
2 -rrb- there are many different kinds of leadership roles , and each requires a different style .
leadership roles also change over time , so must the style of the leader or manager .
3 -rrb- national culture is a set of conditions that affects both 1 -rrb- & 2 -rrb- - how leaders are developed , and the kinds of positions they occupy .
leadership is also concerned with values , and therefore leaders have to be in harmony with the surrounding culture .
the answer to your question is , therefore , yes i do have a framework that would be take too long to explain in detail , but which is based upon : a -rrb- a model of human individual differences and types b -rrb- a model of types of leadership situations and their demands , and c -rrb- ideas about the processes that achieve the best fit between these .
to find out more you 'll have to read my books or come on one of the leadership courses i direct !
question iain humphries , uk how do you motivate a team , group or company when the staff know that they will not receive any training , pay rise , bonus or incentives despite the company making big profits .
please note that the staff work hard and long hours without overtime .
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school in a word - communicate !
i sense a very particular story beneath your brief question , so i can only speak here in the most general terms .
the best businesses create a sense of community in which there is a shared destiny for all members .
this can mean that wealth-sharing is deferred for the sake of business-building investments .
people can accept such a strategy so long as they do n't think they are being treated cynically or exploited .
it is the leadership 's job to create a culture through open communications and trust in which people feel committed , involved , recognised and fairly treated .
if you are the leader , i suggest you call them all together in a ' town hall meeting ' and you confront the issue directly .
give them the recognition for the long hours etc . , pick out for praise as many as deserve it , and explain to them the current state of the business and its future strategic trajectory in terms of what this means for costs , revenues and incentives .
be frank about the problems and challenges , and commit to soliciting their partnership and help in solving them .
get people to voice their immediate current concerns or questions .
if there is something you ca n't answer , commit to a deferred response .
take your people with you .
return to the top question m. forbes , uk i am finalising a business plan and about to approach and recruit two ex-colleagues in an effort to strengthen the management team .
how do i prevent these ex-colleagues from taking my idea and ' going it alone ' ?
n.b. the idea is an internet-based data service , not a physical product where a patent could be obtained .
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london you could insist that they sign a confidentiality and non-competition agreement .
the first part of this would forbid them from going into competition with you for a certain period of time or within a defined geographical region .
the terms of this must not be drafted too widely or the courts may deem it too restrictive and refuse to enforce the promise .
by signing a confidentiality agreement - also known as a non-disclosure agreement or ' nda ' - the other party undertakes not to disclose any confidential information he learns while working with you .
you should be aware that in practice such agreements can be difficult to enforce as it may be hard to prove that the particular information is genuinely confidential -lrb- merely labelling it ' secret ' will not suffice -rrb- or that an individual is using secret information or disclosing it to others .
question richard dance , uk what are the legal or commercial advantages and disadvantages of starting up a company offshore rather than in the uk ?
for example , a base in the isle of man ?
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london the main advantage of trading through an offshore company is the ability to avoid paying tax on your profits .
unfortunately , there is more to trading offshore than just registering your company elsewhere .
for tax purposes , a company is resident in the uk and liable to uk tax if it is registered here .
companies registered in the isle of man -lrb- or any other offshore jurisdiction -rrb- will still be deemed resident in the uk if their ' central management and control ' is exercised in the uk .
it 's not enough just to appoint an offshore nominee and hold board meetings in that country if it 's actually you running the company .
many companies manage to exist offshore and enjoy the benefits of doing so but you should be aware that the rules governing such companies are extremely complicated so take advice before committing yourself .
starting and running an offshore company also costs many times more than it does on the uk mainland .
return to the top the opinions expressed above are those of the panel of experts , not the bbc 's .
the advice is not intended to be definitive and should be used for guidance only .
always seek professional advice for your own particular situation .

whether you are worried about growing your company without losing control , or agonising over funding for a new business , our panellists can help you .
following a strong response , bbc news online is publishing several sets of answers to your questions .
we have tried to include as many questions as possible .
anita roddick , founder of the body shop , on the creative retailing of shoes and earning a livelihood .
simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer , talks about positioning a product in relation to a competitor .
david wilkinson , partner at ernst & young , gives the rundown on investing in a friend 's business .

peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking , on using overdrafts and setting up in the catering trade .
nigel nicholson , professor , london business school , comments on the vagaries of leadership and motivating a team without pay rises .
david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london , offers help on confidentiality agreements and setting up offshore .
bbc news online will publish the next set of answers from our panel of small business experts on tuesday , 30 september .
question keith moses , england what are the options for growing a business that designs ladies shoes predominantly for early adopters .
currently this business sources materials from italy and undertakes actual production in portugal , which reduces unit production costs by as much as 30 % .
given the difficulty of getting into established uk department stores , we have considered opening our own retail outlet but we were told there was no money to be made from selling shoes .
in the past we considered product placement , celebrity-based advertising , and using agents to serve export markets , but we needed capital injection to move on this .
what options do we have ?
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop lucky you .
this is a product line where you can claim your fame easier than in apparel .
what is on offer in the uk can be really dull or jaw-dropping creative .
camper is a company based in majorca which uses the peasant footwear as inspiration .
learn everything from them .
go on their website , look at their stores and their retail design .
it is a perfect example of how little money you need to pay for interior design in the fashion world .
' there is no money to be made in shoes ' ? ?
hah !
tell that to bata or to prada !
firstly get your product right .
keep it creative , use the soles for messages that turn the whole concept of shoes upside down , like camper does .
design a great catalogue , hawk it around -lrb- without leaving it around -rrb- and then you will find the truth of your products in people 's reactions to them .
if you have got it right , then open up your first wee store , if that provides you all with a good livelihood , then and only then think of the next step .
question sam , uk from conception of the business idea to being up and running , how long did it take anita to go from being in the red to being in the in the black ?
my partner is looking into starting up but we have no idea how long it could take to start making money !
answer anita roddick , founder of the body shop it does n't work like that as you keep investing to develop the product or the concept .
why not think this way - will it provide me with a livelihood ?
return to the top question m.f. dossa , sri lanka how important is it to position one 's product , particularly if your major competitor has positioned himself -lrb- successfully -rrb- on value for money i.e. low price ?
but in blind tests -lrb- of fruit drinks -rrb- , my competitor fails miserably -lrb- 90 % prefer my company 's products -rrb- .
how should i communicate with the market place ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer when consumers are faced with a choice of brands , they will position your product relative to the other brands , based on how well they think each product meets their needs .
as positioning is effectively the ranking of your product by consumers , positioning is critical because it will determine whether a consumer will purchase your product or choose a competitor 's .
if you are entering a crowded market , the more distinct your product is and the more that your product has an advantage over the competition , the more attractive its position will be to the consumer and therefore the more likely they will be to buy your product .
the fact that a well-established , major competitor has positioned himself on low price would make it unwise to try to adopt the same positioning .
generally , the more established and bigger a company is , the longer it can sustain a lower price if a price war kicks off .
so , unless you have found a different source , ingredients , or production technique that allows you to sustain a low price , i would n't go head-to-head with them on price .
ideally , the positioning you adopt should also be sustainable so that you reap the benefits of your work for as long as possible .
whatever positioning you adopt , it is essential that you can substantiate it .
it is very unlikely consumers will purchase a product twice if your product claims do n't meet the expectations that they create in the mind of the consumer .
if your product is preferred on taste by 90 % of consumers , you have found a great positioning .
but you are going to have to be able to substantiate a claim like that with independent evidence .
you should also bear in mind that , while it is perfectly legal to make comparative claims against other brands and even name the other brand , the evidence will also have to be able to stand up in court , as i would imagine that large competitors will not think twice about getting involved in lengthy and expensive court case to try to discourage further comparative claims made against them .
an alternative is to make a non-direct comparative claim along the lines of ' the fruit juice preferred by nine out of 10 adults / kids ' -lrb- or whoever the target market is -rrb- .
but this claim will still need to be independently substantiated .
do n't be afraid of substantiating your claims as credibility in advertising is definitely appreciated by consumers !
return to the top question stevie m , uk i am thinking about investing in a pal of mine 's new clothing business .
he 's extremely talented and has good drive and business sense , but this is a gamble and could leave me in a bit of financial trouble if it fails .
what are the biggest traps to look out for when starting out in a venture like this ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young your question suggests that you are not going to be closely involved in running the business .
if that is the case , one trap you may be falling into is to invest more than you can afford to lose in someone else 's company when you have no control over events .
if possible , insist that you have an involvement in decision-making and access to financial information .
then at least you can look out for traps and pitfalls such as : over-reliance on a small number of large customers , or even one - try to spread the risk .
overtrading - growing the business without adequate funding in place to cope with the working capital requirements .
allowing your cost base to build up in anticipation of sales that do not happen - be mean , particularly in the early stages !
failing to manage cash , by not looking ahead to identify forthcoming requirements , not collecting debts quickly enough and not managing creditors - cash is king !
failing to keep the bank informed - keep talking to your funders .
losing control of the business due to a lack of management information - produce simple , timely , sensible information .
building up stocks in anticipation of sales that do not happen - do n't believe too much in your forecasts , they will always be wrong !
failing to meet your customers ' requirements - deliver on time and to the required specification .
failing to allow for the unexpected - keep something in reserve , because the unexpected will happen !
losing key employees - work out who is critical to the business and what you need to do to keep them .
going into the unknown without proper advice - good advice may seem expensive , but it is usually not as expensive as the potential mistake .
dilution - if money runs out and new investment is sought , the new investors have the whip hand and the early investors always lose out .
investing in someone else 's business is risky .
professionals manage a portfolio of investments and they always expect some to go wrong , however much they know about the companies and their industries - they still have others that will be successful .
you are only investing in one business - make sure you can afford for it to go wrong !

question tim , uk i have been trying to start my own business for the last two years but find myself in a catch-22 position .
although investors say they like the business plan they are unwilling to invest until we get a commitment from some customers .
however , customers are unwilling to commit until they can see a financially sound company .
how can i get out of this catch-22 position ?
answer judith rutherford , head of business link for london there are two funding options that may help resolve your problem .
firstly , the small firms loan guarantee scheme , where 75 % of the value of the loan is underwritten by the government .
this is available through high street banks .
secondly , depending on your business type , location and other factors , there may be specific grants or loans available to you .
many areas in the country run ' access to finance ' schemes under one name or another , usually through the local business link , which help businesses become finance-ready and source funding .
i would suggest contacting your local business link and investigating www.j4b.co.uk for further information .

your bank manager or financial adviser in swaziland should be able to help you to decide on the best options for your business .

as i have yet to see accounts , my general question is would a bank , depending on circumstances , be prepared to back this sort of venture ?
i would have about £ 150k to put in and would need to borrow about £ 350k .
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking the banks are always keen to discuss viable business propositions .
i would suggest that your starting point would be to review the company 's accounts and begin to develop your business plan .
if you have no experience in the area , there are many advisers available to assist you with this process .
this will help you to identify for yourself the opportunities and problems with the business , which you will then be able to develop to your advantage .
it is positive that you have a personal contribution to make to the project as this helps demonstrate you commitment to a lender .

return to the top question yury , uk as management and leadership styles vary across cultures and national borders , do you still have a common framework when offering your expertise ?
how do you adapt to local conditions ?
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school you have raised one of the most complex and controversial questions in management science .
i shall try to keep my answer straightforward : 1 -rrb- i believe that the deep drivers of leadership are universal , related to the genetics of character and cognition , but for these to emerge and turn into actual leadership requires a supportive environment and sympathetic culture .
2 -rrb- there are many different kinds of leadership roles , and each requires a different style .
leadership roles also change over time , so must the style of the leader or manager .
3 -rrb- national culture is a set of conditions that affects both 1 -rrb- & 2 -rrb- - how leaders are developed , and the kinds of positions they occupy .
leadership is also concerned with values , and therefore leaders have to be in harmony with the surrounding culture .
the answer to your question is , therefore , yes i do have a framework that would be take too long to explain in detail , but which is based upon : a -rrb- a model of human individual differences and types b -rrb- a model of types of leadership situations and their demands , and c -rrb- ideas about the processes that achieve the best fit between these .
to find out more you 'll have to read my books or come on one of the leadership courses i direct !
question iain humphries , uk how do you motivate a team , group or company when the staff know that they will not receive any training , pay rise , bonus or incentives despite the company making big profits .
please note that the staff work hard and long hours without overtime .
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school in a word - communicate !
i sense a very particular story beneath your brief question , so i can only speak here in the most general terms .
the best businesses create a sense of community in which there is a shared destiny for all members .
this can mean that wealth-sharing is deferred for the sake of business-building investments .
people can accept such a strategy so long as they do n't think they are being treated cynically or exploited .
it is the leadership 's job to create a culture through open communications and trust in which people feel committed , involved , recognised and fairly treated .
if you are the leader , i suggest you call them all together in a ' town hall meeting ' and you confront the issue directly .
give them the recognition for the long hours etc . , pick out for praise as many as deserve it , and explain to them the current state of the business and its future strategic trajectory in terms of what this means for costs , revenues and incentives .
be frank about the problems and challenges , and commit to soliciting their partnership and help in solving them .
get people to voice their immediate current concerns or questions .
if there is something you ca n't answer , commit to a deferred response .
take your people with you .

how do i prevent these ex-colleagues from taking my idea and ' going it alone ' ?
n.b. the idea is an internet-based data service , not a physical product where a patent could be obtained .
answer david ladds , law lecturer , king 's college london you could insist that they sign a confidentiality and non-competition agreement .
the first part of this would forbid them from going into competition with you for a certain period of time or within a defined geographical region .
the terms of this must not be drafted too widely or the courts may deem it too restrictive and refuse to enforce the promise .
by signing a confidentiality agreement - also known as a non-disclosure agreement or ' nda ' - the other party undertakes not to disclose any confidential information he learns while working with you .
you should be aware that in practice such agreements can be difficult to enforce as it may be hard to prove that the particular information is genuinely confidential -lrb- merely labelling it ' secret ' will not suffice -rrb- or that an individual is using secret information or disclosing it to others .
question richard dance , uk what are the legal or commercial advantages and disadvantages of starting up a company offshore rather than in the uk ?

bassetlaw mp john mann , who is reopening a public inquiry into drug abuse in north nottinghamshire on tuesday , is calling for more treatment for heroin users .
mr mann says some addicts are kicking their habit , but much work remains to really make sure the problem is under control .
" it is getting people off the drug and out of crime and back into work that is important - it has been successful here but we want medical help offered routinely and immediately to all heroin addicts , " mr mann said .
jobs needed the labour mp said one surgery in worksop , nottinghamshire is treating 60 heroin addicts .
former coal mining areas in north nottinghamshire and south yorkshire have been affected by unemployment and drug addiction , prompting mr mann to organise the public inquiry in 2002 .
mr mann is also calling for better drugs education in secondary schools along with more job opportunities for former addicts .

data presented to the european cancer conference in copenhagen , denmark , showed deaths fell 20 % from 1990 to 2000 .
mortality has followed the same pattern as it has in the united states , where rates have fallen by a third in the same period .
rates had been increasing during the 1970s and 80s .
professor sir richard peto of the university of oxford said death rates from the disease in europe had dropped from 106 per 100,000 men in 1990 to 87 per 100,000 a decade later .
in the us , deaths fell from around 124 to 83 per 100,000 over the same period .
prostate cancer is the most common form of the disease in uk men .
castration professor peto , who worked on the research by the prostate cancer trialists collaborative group , also analysed results from studies of 5,000 men aged 65 to 74 to evaluate the impact of hormonal treatments on prostate cancer survival rates .
they found giving early hormonal treatment for prostate cancer improved 10 year survival rates by 12 % , compared to men who were not given the treatment until their cancer was more advanced .
however , deciding to use hormonal treatments is not a simple choice for doctors and patients .
the most popular treatment used to be surgical castration , where the testes which produce the male hormone testosterone are completely removed .
because of the radical nature of the treatment , it tended to be reserved for men with advanced disease .
anti-hormonal drugs are now available which can also be used for men with early stage disease , but these still cause impotence and shrivelled testes .
newer drugs are available which do not have these side effects , but less research has been carried out into their effectiveness .
the improve in survival rates in prostate cancer mirrors the benefits of hormonal treatments such as tamoxifen .
uk and us breast cancer death rates have fallen by around a third since 1990 .
survival chances professor peto told bbc news online the latest data on prostate cancer deaths in europe confirmed the benefits of using hormonal treatments .
" they really do relate to better survival .
" if you get in there early with hormone treatment in prostate cancer , then it will substantially reduce the likelihood you 'll die of the cancer in the next 10 years . "
but he added : " whether to use it is not an easy decision because of the side effects of the treatment .
" there are hormonal treatments which do not have these effects , but they are not as widely tested . "

fifteen of the 17 parties consulted by the military rejected the former interior minister , antonio artur sanha , saying it had previously been agreed that the new prime minister should not belong to a political party .
an adviser to general verissimo correia seabra , who led the coup , had earlier warned all parties that the names of ministers agreed by the military amounted to a decision , not a proposal .

he is likely to enjoy support from the military because the armed forces are dominated by members of his ethnic community .
observers say a faction inside the military junta pressurised general seabra to give up the idea of retaining the presidency by telling him that he could not be president and armed forces chief-of-staff at the same time .
the general reportedly decided to hold on to his military post after realising his position would be weakened if he became president .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- tony ball : murdoch 's solid enforcer bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture tuesday , 23 september , 2003 , 09:01 gmt 10:01 uk tony ball : murdoch 's solid enforcer by ian youngs bbc news online entertainment staff tony ball is to leave his £ 2m-a-year job as chief executive of digital broadcaster bskyb , it has been confirmed .
the bbc 's director general greg dyke recently said there were two " 800 lb gorillas " in the british broadcasting industry - the bbc and bskyb .
and , in his four years at the top of bskyb , tony ball can take the credit for building up his business - and arguably keeping itv and the cable companies out of the heavyweight division .
mr ball , 47 , has been a solid , steady and very capable enforcer of the long-term vision held by rupert murdoch , bskyb 's chairman .
that vision , put simply , is domination - at least of the pay tv market .
and in the company 's latest annual report , mr murdoch gave mr ball 's work a glowing endorsement .
" thanks largely to sky , the uk now leads the world in its take-up of digital television , " he wrote .
mr ball has put his boss 's plan into practice - and in a highly competitive and risky business , that was no easy task .
his main achievements were to take bskyb into profit for the first time in five years and take subscriber numbers up to the company 's seven million target .
and he has kept hold of the tv rights for live premiership matches - a vital attraction for many viewers .
" he 's turned the business around , " rosemary gallagher , sky specialist at broadcast magazine said .
and anthony de larrinaga , media analyst with sg securities , said : " he 's executed the strategy in an exemplary fashion . "
mr ball has television in his blood - he began his career as an outside broadcast engineer for thames television after leaving school at 16 .
he moved to british satellite broadcasting - which was swallowed up by sky in the first satellite revolution - before having stints in sports management and at sky sports .
he was credited with boosting the fortunes of us channel fox sports international - another part of the murdoch empire - before leaving to take the helm at bskyb in june 1999 .
" i do n't just want sky in every home - i want it watched in every home , " is a famous rallying cry .
when he took over , the digital revolution was just starting and , although sky was in a strong position , its fortunes had been on a rollercoaster during the previous decade .
there were big challenges ahead and - as itv digital , cable companies and other european multi-channel broadcasters showed - it was easier to fail than to succeed .
mr ball had to persuade its viewers with the original analogue satellite service to switch to digital - and keep them happy in the process .
not only did he do that , but they are spending more and fewer are leaving the service than ever .
mr ball was viewed " very highly " by the industry , ms gallagher said . "
sky one does n't have any really great talked-about programmes " rosemary gallagher broadcast magazine " i think he 's more focused on the share price , keeping the city happy and getting more subscribers on board than creating great programming , " she said .
for viewers , there has been a huge increase in choice on the sky platform - but little in the way of successful original programming .
its flagship channel , sky one , is still packed with repeats of the simpsons , buffy and star trek plus series like ibiza uncovered .
" sky one does n't have any really great talked-about programmes or any home-grown successes , " ms gallagher said .
that was something mr ball tried to change in a recent speech to persuade the bbc to auction off its most popular programmes to commercial rivals .
that did not go down too well - but sky may yet get its own hits after appointing dawn airey , who led five , formerly channel five , to respect and stability , to oversee its programming . "
mr ball had come to think of himself as a successful boss in his own right " andrew neil former bskyb chairman " the numbers speak for themselves , " mr de larrinaga said .
" ultimately the responsibility is -lsb- his -rsb- to make sure that people who ring up get boxes and dishes installed when it 's convenient to them so they 're satisfied customers .
" and he 's managed to fend off the regulators and the politicians - which is not always the easiest task . "
when bskyb 's latest financial results came out , media analyst matthew marsden wrote that they were " simply brilliant " .
and an editorial in industry magazine media week said they demanded " unreserved recognition " .
outgrown bskyb 's " notoriously ruthless " negotiations could never be described as " nice " , the magazine said - but it had performed better than any other british media company .
but former bskyb chairman andrew neil said mr ball may have outgrown his position as mr murdoch 's loyal servant .
" mr ball had come to think of himself as a successful boss in his own right , " he said - which was a fatal mistake for even the most valued murdoch executive .
mr ball had every right to think he was his own man but had become " less inclined to do his master 's bidding " , mr neil said .

ball began his career in tv aged 16 the bbc 's director general greg dyke recently said there were two " 800 lb gorillas " in the british broadcasting industry - the bbc and bskyb .
and , in his four years at the top of bskyb , tony ball can take the credit for building up his business - and arguably keeping itv and the cable companies out of the heavyweight division .
mr ball , 47 , has been a solid , steady and very capable enforcer of the long-term vision held by rupert murdoch , bskyb 's chairman .
that vision , put simply , is domination - at least of the pay tv market .
and in the company 's latest annual report , mr murdoch gave mr ball 's work a glowing endorsement .
" thanks largely to sky , the uk now leads the world in its take-up of digital television , " he wrote .
he helped bskyb return to profit for the first time in five years mr ball has put his boss 's plan into practice - and in a highly competitive and risky business , that was no easy task .
his main achievements were to take bskyb into profit for the first time in five years and take subscriber numbers up to the company 's seven million target .
and he has kept hold of the tv rights for live premiership matches - a vital attraction for many viewers .
" he 's turned the business around , " rosemary gallagher , sky specialist at broadcast magazine said .
and anthony de larrinaga , media analyst with sg securities , said : " he 's executed the strategy in an exemplary fashion . "
mr ball has television in his blood - he began his career as an outside broadcast engineer for thames television after leaving school at 16 .
he moved to british satellite broadcasting - which was swallowed up by sky in the first satellite revolution - before having stints in sports management and at sky sports .
some of sky 's highest ratings come from football matches he was credited with boosting the fortunes of us channel fox sports international - another part of the murdoch empire - before leaving to take the helm at bskyb in june 1999 .
" i do n't just want sky in every home - i want it watched in every home , " is a famous rallying cry .
when he took over , the digital revolution was just starting and , although sky was in a strong position , its fortunes had been on a rollercoaster during the previous decade .
there were big challenges ahead and - as itv digital , cable companies and other european multi-channel broadcasters showed - it was easier to fail than to succeed .
mr ball had to persuade its viewers with the original analogue satellite service to switch to digital - and keep them happy in the process .
not only did he do that , but they are spending more and fewer are leaving the service than ever .
mr ball was viewed " very highly " by the industry , ms gallagher said .

when he took over , the digital revolution was just starting and , although sky was in a strong position , its fortunes had been on a rollercoaster during the previous decade .
there were big challenges ahead and - as itv digital , cable companies and other european multi-channel broadcasters showed - it was easier to fail than to succeed .
mr ball had to persuade its viewers with the original analogue satellite service to switch to digital - and keep them happy in the process .
not only did he do that , but they are spending more and fewer are leaving the service than ever .
mr ball was viewed " very highly " by the industry , ms gallagher said .
sky one does n't have any really great talked-about programmes rosemary gallagher broadcast magazine " i think he 's more focused on the share price , keeping the city happy and getting more subscribers on board than creating great programming , " she said .
for viewers , there has been a huge increase in choice on the sky platform - but little in the way of successful original programming .
its flagship channel , sky one , is still packed with repeats of the simpsons , buffy and star trek plus series like ibiza uncovered .
" sky one does n't have any really great talked-about programmes or any home-grown successes , " ms gallagher said .
that was something mr ball tried to change in a recent speech to persuade the bbc to auction off its most popular programmes to commercial rivals .
that did not go down too well - but sky may yet get its own hits after appointing dawn airey , who led five , formerly channel five , to respect and stability , to oversee its programming .
mr ball had come to think of himself as a successful boss in his own right andrew neil former bskyb chairman " the numbers speak for themselves , " mr de larrinaga said .
" ultimately the responsibility is -lsb- his -rsb- to make sure that people who ring up get boxes and dishes installed when it 's convenient to them so they 're satisfied customers .
" and he 's managed to fend off the regulators and the politicians - which is not always the easiest task . "
when bskyb 's latest financial results came out , media analyst matthew marsden wrote that they were " simply brilliant " .
and an editorial in industry magazine media week said they demanded " unreserved recognition " .
outgrown bskyb 's " notoriously ruthless " negotiations could never be described as " nice " , the magazine said - but it had performed better than any other british media company .
but former bskyb chairman andrew neil said mr ball may have outgrown his position as mr murdoch 's loyal servant .
" mr ball had come to think of himself as a successful boss in his own right , " he said - which was a fatal mistake for even the most valued murdoch executive .
mr ball had every right to think he was his own man but had become " less inclined to do his master 's bidding " , mr neil said .

eyewitnesses say up to 18 others were seriously injured when the security forces fired on inmates .
the first riot sparked anti-government street protests on saturday in the capital , male , which damaged several public buildings .
the second riot was on sunday , but telephones in the jail were switched off until tuesday so news is only now filtering out .
the violence is unprecedented in the maldives , a sleepy atoll famed for its beach resorts .
speech sparked second riot a riot on friday in maafushi jail was the trigger for anti-government protests but it has now emerged there was more trouble on sunday .
the prisoners say they were angry after they heard that the president had accused them of attacking the prison armoury in a televised address to the nation on saturday .
this , they say , was a lie because they had no idea where the armoury was .
eyewitnesses say after the second riot the prisoners were chained and handcuffed in their cells on sunday and kept without food until monday night .
one man said he saw injured people lying everywhere after the security forces opened fire .
maldives basics 1,200 islands in archipelago population is over 300,000 majority is sunni muslim one-party rule since 1978 low-lying islands vulnerable to rise in sea-levels many of the seriously wounded have been flown to neighbouring sri lanka for medical treatment .
one man with bullet injuries to his chest died in a private hospital in colombo but the authorities have not released his name .
it appears the authorities are sending the injured abroad in an attempt to calm the situation in the capital , where the sight of the first two dead bodies triggered violence directed against government buildings and the police .
several reports from male say a number of well-known opposition supporters and young people suspected of involvement in the protests have been picked up for questioning but it is not clear how many .
did you witness any of the disturbances in the maldives ?
send us your comments using the form below .
if you have any photos send them to yourpics @ bbc.co.uk i was watching the mob on the streets from my house on saturday night .
the crowd was huge , armed with butchers ' knives and iron rods ... basically anything they could find .
suddenly the police arrived in armoured vehicles , and dropped a smoke bomb right in front of my house .
within minutes the crowds dispersed .
a curfew was set for the night and my brother -lsb- who lives on a nearby island -rsb- was stopped by the police on his way to the ferry terminal and was asked to stay in male and to stay indoors .
since then the police have been everywhere , questioning everyone on the streets , schools have been closed and even some businesses .
everyone is stopped on the road and asked for their identification and details of where they are going .
violet , maldives for the first time in the modern history of maldives there was such unrest and mayhem .
i saw youngsters burning the high court building .
all the sub-police stations , office of the commisioner of elections and the national conference centre -lrb- dharubaaruge -rrb- were also attacked by mobs .
unfortunately no news of the incident appeared in any of the newspapers .
the radio and tv did n't broadcast any .
ismail abdulla , maldives i saw the riot in progress and have witnessed much of the police 's activities that have been going on today -lsb- tuesday -rsb- .
my friends and i have seen many people being hauled in off the streets in male by the police and the government 's security forces - being dragged out of shops and homes .
we have heard that people have been taken away by the police and security forces in the middle of the night , nobody knows where to or under what charge .
the police and the security forces appear to be arresting anyone who was seen during the riots and anyone who was caught on camera when the buildings were attacked .
the police had cameras during the riots and there were cameras in the buildings that were attacked .
my friends last night saw two men being hauled out of their shops and thrown into police vans , just before curfew started .
i have also seen many young people being arrested , not hardened criminals as the government claims .
everyone here is very scared of possible government reprisals .
' rosa ' , maldives here in the capital male everything was calm and stable as usual until the afternoon at about 2:00 am on saturday -lsb- 20 september 2003 -rsb- .
it was only a few crowd running around burning and destroying some of the government buildings .
no private property was damaged or affected .
it is very first time in the current history of maldives that this kind of a thing happened .
people obeyed the request from the president and most had returned home instead , enjoying the scenery .
rasheed , maldives people here have no right to throw stones and fire government buildings .
it was almost crazy but the government is doing its best and i am sure they will do it .
it 's all rumours in here .
pink , maldives the violence first erupted near the hospital when the police refused to let the friends and family of the injured inmates access to the hospital .
in a tense situation the police tried to show its macho muscles and this sparked further agitation and unrest .

security forces fired tear gas into the rioting crowds in male eyewitnesses say up to 18 others were seriously injured when the security forces fired on inmates .
the first riot sparked anti-government street protests on saturday in the capital , male , which damaged several public buildings .
the second riot was on sunday , but telephones in the jail were switched off until tuesday so news is only now filtering out .
the violence is unprecedented in the maldives , a sleepy atoll famed for its beach resorts .
speech sparked second riot a riot on friday in maafushi jail was the trigger for anti-government protests but it has now emerged there was more trouble on sunday .
the prisoners say they were angry after they heard that the president had accused them of attacking the prison armoury in a televised address to the nation on saturday .
this , they say , was a lie because they had no idea where the armoury was .
eyewitnesses say after the second riot the prisoners were chained and handcuffed in their cells on sunday and kept without food until monday night .
one man said he saw injured people lying everywhere after the security forces opened fire .
maldives basics 1,200 islands in archipelago population is over 300,000 majority is sunni muslim one-party rule since 1978 low-lying islands vulnerable to rise in sea-levels many of the seriously wounded have been flown to neighbouring sri lanka for medical treatment .
one man with bullet injuries to his chest died in a private hospital in colombo but the authorities have not released his name .
it appears the authorities are sending the injured abroad in an attempt to calm the situation in the capital , where the sight of the first two dead bodies triggered violence directed against government buildings and the police .
several reports from male say a number of well-known opposition supporters and young people suspected of involvement in the protests have been picked up for questioning but it is not clear how many .

within minutes the crowds dispersed .
a curfew was set for the night and my brother -lsb- who lives on a nearby island -rsb- was stopped by the police on his way to the ferry terminal and was asked to stay in male and to stay indoors .

swiss said its customers would " benefit from this development in the form of a substantially expanded range of services " .
the agreement will give ba access to swiss take-off and landing slots at london 's heathrow airport , swiss said .
ba will also back a financial bail-out for swiss in the form of a credit facility worth 50m swiss francs -lrb- $ 37m ; £ 22.4m -rrb- which will be secured against the slots .
survival measure the swiss airline 's decision to join the oneworld alliance puts an end to speculation that it might merge with germany 's lufthansa , a tie-up that aviation analysts thought would probably have meant the end of swiss as a separate airline .
signing up to oneworld keeps loss-making swiss independent , there are still questions as to whether the company will survive in an overcrowded , highly competitive marketplace .
swiss chief executive andre dose said on tuesday that the loss-making airline plans to return to profit in 2005 .
following the tie-up , two major swiss banks , ubs and credit suisse , have said they are willing to offer further loan facilities to swiss , the airline said .
swiss international was formed out of the collapse of swissair in late 2001 .
the group was restructed under the management of its one-time regional subsidiary crossair .
the failure of swissair provoked a sense of national trauma in switzerland .
ailing swiss the swiss government stepped in to broker a survival package .
it persuaded the airline 's banks to extend fresh loans and swiss firms to give up tax concessions so funds could be diverted to the airline .
but swiss international 's business has not gone well since then , and in june 2003 the airline announced it would shed 34 aircraft - one third of its planes - in an effort to save 1.6bn swiss francs -lrb- $ 1.21bn ; £ 725m -rrb- .
it said it was dropping one third of its routes to streamline the business , and plans to cease flying to washington dc , beijing or rio de janeiro .
the plan also included 3,000 job cuts in the company 's 9,000 strong workforce .
swiss racked up a net loss of 333m swiss francs -lrb- $ 240m ; £ 149m -rrb- in the first half of 2002 .

herbert lipah , who runs the world 's largest lederhosen shop in munich , came up with idea during a recent beer festival .
herr lipah , 55 , said he was inundated with requests from men who wanted something to stuff in their socks to make their calves appear more manly .
he told bbc scotland 's good morning scotland programme it works just as well for kilts as for leather shorts .
' too small ' " some people said to me i have problems with my calves , " he explained .
" it came to me that this was a funny and lovely idea , not only for the bavarians .
" when you try lederhosen and the legs look too small inside the socks , some people said ' no , i ca n't have lederhosen , it 's no good for me ' .
" the implants look good , they are funny and all the people around the world love them . "
herr lipah believes the long-term tradition involved in both the lederhosen and highland dress markets will mean his invention has legs .
the lederhosen lipah store implants sell for 25 euros , about £ 17 , and come in small , medium , large and extra-large .

twelve others received life imprisonment on monday for burning the missionary graham staines alive , along with his sons - philip , who was 10 , and timothy , eight , in 1999 .
a court found the defendants guilty last week of rioting , arson and culpable homicide amounting to murder .
the death penalty is used rarely in india and is reserved for the most serious crimes . "
he formed a militant group ... to physically liquidate staines in the belief that with staines the spread of christianity will be buried " judge mahendra pattnaik judge pattnaik said the attack on the staines demonstrated that " humanity is not fully civilised " .
" a crime has no religion .
what sin -lsb- had -rsb- the two small boys committed ? " the judge said in his written judgement released overnight .
militant group dara singh , the main accused who received the death penalty , is said to have led a militant campaign against christians and muslims , although an investigation said there was no evidence that hardline hindu groups had organised the attack on the staines .
" he formed a militant group of local tribals to physically liquidate staines in the belief that with staines the spread of christianity will be buried in the area .
" the rest of the convicts who are gullible tribals blindly followed him , " the judge said .
the death sentence has to be confirmed by higher courts , but singh is not planning to appeal .
" singh says he will prefer to be hanged rather than go in for an appeal , " defence lawyer bana mohanty said .
defendants have the right to appeal all the way to the supreme court and can then ask for a presidential pardon .
forgiven mr staines had spent 30 years working with leprosy patients in orissa .
his widow , gladys , still lives in india , continuing the work , and says she has forgiven the killers .
" but forgiveness and the consequences of the crime should not be mixed up ...
no individual is above the law of the land , " she said in a statement after sentenced was passed .
the missionary 's brother , john staines , had argued against a death sentence , fearing it would stir up more extremism .
" they committed a terrible crime , but the sort of thing that jesus christ espoused was that if we ca n't forgive our fellow men then how can he forgive us , " he said in melbourne , australia .
the staines died when the jeep they were sleeping in was torched outside a church in the remote village of manoharpur in orissa in january 1999 .
the killings sparked condemnation in india and around the world .

twelve others received life imprisonment on monday for burning the missionary graham staines alive , along with his sons - philip , who was 10 , and timothy , eight , in 1999 .
a court found the defendants guilty last week of rioting , arson and culpable homicide amounting to murder .
the death penalty is used rarely in india and is reserved for the most serious crimes .
he formed a militant group ... to physically liquidate staines in the belief that with staines the spread of christianity will be buried judge mahendra pattnaik judge pattnaik said the attack on the staines demonstrated that " humanity is not fully civilised " .
" a crime has no religion .
what sin -lsb- had -rsb- the two small boys committed ? " the judge said in his written judgement released overnight .
militant group dara singh , the main accused who received the death penalty , is said to have led a militant campaign against christians and muslims , although an investigation said there was no evidence that hardline hindu groups had organised the attack on the staines .
" he formed a militant group of local tribals to physically liquidate staines in the belief that with staines the spread of christianity will be buried in the area .
" the rest of the convicts who are gullible tribals blindly followed him , " the judge said .
the death sentence has to be confirmed by higher courts , but singh is not planning to appeal .
" singh says he will prefer to be hanged rather than go in for an appeal , " defence lawyer bana mohanty said .
defendants have the right to appeal all the way to the supreme court and can then ask for a presidential pardon .
forgiven mr staines had spent 30 years working with leprosy patients in orissa .
his widow , gladys , still lives in india , continuing the work , and says she has forgiven the killers .
dara singh : not planning to appeal " but forgiveness and the consequences of the crime should not be mixed up ...
no individual is above the law of the land , " she said in a statement after sentenced was passed .
the missionary 's brother , john staines , had argued against a death sentence , fearing it would stir up more extremism .
" they committed a terrible crime , but the sort of thing that jesus christ espoused was that if we ca n't forgive our fellow men then how can he forgive us , " he said in melbourne , australia .

the honour is the latest in a string of high ratings and awards which has seen the south shropshire town become renowned as a gastronomic centre .
the town boasts more michelin-starred restaurants than anywhere else in the country , outside london .
and in the time out survey , voted by a panel of more than 500 national and regional culinary experts , only london had more restaurants in the top ten .
shaun hill , owner of the merchant house said he was pleased the magazine had expanded from its traditional metropolitan base for the survey .
" all lists are controversial , " he said .
" in this one all the contacts are largely metropolitan and i know the times newspaper gave a round of applause for the four london restaurants for nine million people , but what 's more interesting to me is the two ludlow restaurants for 9,000 people .
