there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .
even if the delegates fail to find agreement on the remaining sticky issues , they still plan to submit a blueprint at next friday 's summit .
after that they 'll still have three more weeks to fine tune the language before handing the final draft over to the incoming italian presidency on july 18 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu convention reaches compromise the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit .

there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw " mcberti " takes on his former team german players pessimistic ahead of italy clash culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.06.2003 reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walk the walk but do n't talk the talk : rudi völler -lrb- left -rrb- and michael ballack in training .
everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .
but instead of playing up to the role of favorites , the german camp is towing the regular party line of near silence .
germans giving nothing away as much as the germans like to celebrate their regular successes on the international soccer scene , they are a reticent bunch when the outcome of the competition has yet to be decided .
in typical fashion , the germans refused to build themselves up before the scotland game on saturday , despite being the stronger team on paper , and are typically tight-lipped about their chances against the faroes .
it seems the safest option .
the refusal to blow their own trumpet has every angle covered - win , lose or draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose looks forward to facing the faroe islands .
so far , no one can be pinned down on the way they expect the game to go .
midfielder michael ballack refused to comment on the possible result at a recent press conference and instead directed some diplomatic yet thinly- veiled criticism to stir his team mates ahead of the clash by saying , " some of the players must realize what it means to play for germany and act accordingly . "
meanwhile striker miroslav klose took the easy way out and played dumb when quizzed on germany 's opponents : " all i know is there 's plenty of sheep with mountains in the background . "
proceed with caution ?
although expectation within the sport was high of a crushing german victory over mcberti and his team of brave scots ; as usual none of it seemed to emanate from the german players themselves .
and while there were no words to come back to haunt them after finishing the match with a single point , the apparent caution in their media approach was extended to their display on the pitch .
the germans seemed to balk at the tenacity of scotland and at times looked overawed by the support from the crowd inside the cauldron of noise that was hampden park .
chances are , however , that the germans will overcome the part-timers of the faroes on wednesday to top group five and keep their chances of automatic qualification for the european championships in portugal next summer well and truly alive .
but then again , as the germans seem to acknowledge more than most , nothing can be taken for granted .

the germans were once again expected to put the faroes to the sword but stuttered in front of their own supporters and made a 2:1 victory look like a lucky escape .
the effect of failing to hit double figures on the back of a successful world cup campaign in japan / south korea was evident in coach völler 's stunned reaction to the narrow victory : " it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . "
again , well said rudi ...
völler and his boys may be contemplating another fierce encounter on wednesday , for what the faroes lack in technical skill , they more than make up for in enthusiasm and passion for the game .

everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .

the germans seemed to balk at the tenacity of scotland and at times looked overawed by the support from the crowd inside the cauldron of noise that was hampden park .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .
european double standard ?
the u.s. effort has encountered stiff resistance from european allies , who believe that the terms set by the united states would undermine the power of the court before it has tried its first case .
for their part , the americans accuse the europeans of exercising a double standard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peacekeepers in afghanistan are protected from prosecution by international agreements .
britain , france and other european governments have signed such agreements with afghanistan , shielding thousands of european peacekeepers from surrender by afghan authorities to the hague-based court .
the united states accused the 15-member european union of actively lobbying countries , including the 10 future members of the union , not to sign the u.s.-drafted agreements .
the confidential memo warned that recent improvement in relations with france , germany and other countries that opposed the war in iraq could be undone .
summit in danger " this will undercut all our efforts to repair and rebuild the transatlantic relationship just as we are taking a turn for the better after a number of difficult months , " the confidential memo , known as a démarche , reads .
" we are dismayed that the european union would actively seek to undermine u.s. efforts . "
the dispute may come to a head at a planned summit of european and u.s. leaders in washington on june 25 .
security council vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.n. wants to avoid a split like that over the iraq war .
despite opposition , the resolution to extend the immunity is expected to pass the security council easily on thursday .
the u.n. is extremely wary of entering into yet another fray with the white house , following the debacle over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq earlier this year .
still unclear is whether germany and france will show their opposition to the u.s. stance by abstaining from the vote .
last year 's vote was 15-0 after the united states threatened to veto u.n. peacekeeping missions .
canada seeks debate four key advocates for the court that do not have council seats - canada , switzerland new zealand and jordan – have asked for an open debate on the international criminal court ; this debate may also take place on thursday .
canada 's ambassador to the u.n. , paul heinbecker , said : " we would like to have the opportunity to register our support for the court .
we see it as bringing accountability to the worst tyrants and the perpetrators of crime . "
taking criminals to court as the first permanent global criminal court , the icc was set up to try individuals for the world 's worst atrocities - genocide , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses - in a belated effort to fulfill the promise of the nuremberg trials 57 years ago that prosecuted nazi leaders .
among the court 's chief advocates are european union nations , especially germany , which joined the council this year .
a total of 90 countries have so far ratified the treaty , including all 15 eu member states .
139 countries are signatories to the rome statute of the international criminal court , which established the court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic turbulence reaches new low relations between the united states and europe have hit rock bottom since president george bush took office .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .
european double standard ?
the u.s. effort has encountered stiff resistance from european allies , who believe that the terms set by the united states would undermine the power of the court before it has tried its first case .
for their part , the americans accuse the europeans of exercising a double standard .

britain , france and other european governments have signed such agreements with afghanistan , shielding thousands of european peacekeepers from surrender by afghan authorities to the hague-based court .
the united states accused the 15-member european union of actively lobbying countries , including the 10 future members of the union , not to sign the u.s.-drafted agreements .
the confidential memo warned that recent improvement in relations with france , germany and other countries that opposed the war in iraq could be undone .
summit in danger " this will undercut all our efforts to repair and rebuild the transatlantic relationship just as we are taking a turn for the better after a number of difficult months , " the confidential memo , known as a démarche , reads .

across eastern germany , metalworkers and engineers have laid down their tools , striking for a shorter work week .
can germany afford to give in to union pressure ? thirteen years after reunification , employees at eastern german car , steel and machine tools factories in the former communist states work 38 hours a week - three more than their western counterparts do for the same wage .
for the past week they have been on strike , trying to close that gap . but business leaders say eastern productivity still lags behind and some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist part of germany .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce . instigated by the mighty ig metall trade union when many easterns are looking for work , the strike has caused some to question whether organized labor wields too much power .
recent opinion polls show that increasing numbers of germans agree that their government must scale back its generous social welfare system in order to awake from its economic slumber . but the unions have remained staunchly opposed , determined to defend the welfare state they spent decades helping to erect .
instead , the unions advocate a plan calling for increased public spending in order to stimulate the economy . new attitudes toward unions their resistance to reform has led many germans to turn their back on organized labor .
union membership has dropped to 7.7 million last year , from 11.8 million in 1991 .
and a recent infratest poll showed that 50 percent of germans now say union power should be curbed , versus only 26 percent who think their influence should rise - the exact reverse of four years ago . with the germany economy currently in such a precarious state , the latest strike runs the risk of even further isolating the unions from the public at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " opposition christian democrat party leader angela merkel recently told ard television last month . unions in germany not only exercise their power through demonstrations and work stoppages .
they also can count 80 percent of the social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- federal parliamentarians as members . " in order to placate the unions , the social democratic party sought union-backed candidates during the last elections , to ensure that union people were actively involved in the party , " said political scientist hans-peter müller . the strong union presence in government means it is sometimes hard for german chancellor gerhard schröder to push through his economic reform agenda , and an ever-widening rift has formed between the spd and its once die-hard constituency . as german growth has stalled , schröder ’ s government has begun attempting to push through desperately needed reforms to the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and its inflexible labor market .
while the government is now opposing organized labor , only a few years ago it was toeing the union line . a good example is the issue of job security .
during the last parliament , schröder 's government amended a law making it harder to fire workers in response to union pressure .
because of the dire economic situation , however , the law is once again on the table . worker participation in the early days of the west germany , the unions ' goal was to achieve worker participation in industry .
they quickly became a force to be reckoned with , and step by step they achieved cuts in working hours and broke the employers ' right to dictate wage levels . since the 1950s , unions have grown to hold at least a third of the seats on german companies ' supervisory boards .
in the coal and steel industry , they hold a good half of the seats on every such board . in the current labor dispute rocking eastern germany , one steel company , eko stahl in eisenhütten near the polish border , has already acquiesced to workers ' demands . it granted the 35 hour week in order to get production up and running as quickly as possible . ralf koehler , the representative of ig metall at eko stahl , says the 35 hour week is fair .
" economically , we 've been making a profit for years .
the company is earning millions of euros and we want our just share , " he said . other workers are more in line with the government than their own union , however .
jörg heymann , a maschinist at eko stahl , opposed the strike . " -lrb- keeping -rrb- my job is more important , regardless of the hours , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .

at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments . u.s. and german defense ministers donald rumsfeld and peter struck met in germany during rumsfeld 's first trip to the country since the end of the war in iraq .
at a meeting with the press , rumsfeld indicated that german-american relations were " on their way to a point of normalcy . "
but his subsequent comments , repeating his controversial division between " old europe " and " new europe , " ruffled feathers at a time when many transatlantic issues remain unresolved . the two came together at the tenth anniversary celebration for the george c. marshall center in garmisch-partenkirchen , a security-studies institute funded by both the united states and germany .
both gave speeches and then met briefly to discuss issues at the top of the transatlantic security agenda , including the enlarged participation of german forces in peace-keeping and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan .
rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .
" we agree that it is time to look forward - and not back , " said struck . a transatlantic thaw ? although this represents rumsfeld 's first trip to germany since the start of the war in iraq , it is his second meeting with struck in as many months .
struck traveled to washington in early may to meet with rumsfeld - his trip was the start of an offensive effort -lrb- on the part of both sides -rrb- to overcome the divisions over iraq . struck 's trip to washington was followed by a round of high-level diplomatic meetings and carefully planned photo opportunities , designed to convey the message that both sides were moving on .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell visited germany just a week later and , at the end of the month , president george w. bush approached german chancellor gerhard schröder at the 300th anniversary celebrations in russia and again at the g-8 meeting in evian .
most recently , president bush called chancellor schröder to express his sympathies over the loss of german soldiers in afghanistan . before struck met with rumsfeld in may , he was optimistic about the chances for reconciliation , stating that he had always gotten on well with his u.s.-counterpart and predicting that the matter would be addressed in a matter of minutes .
" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "
one month later , it 's not clear if making-up will be that easy . lingering tensions tensions remain , most recently surfacing during the debate over the international criminal court .
the bush administration has been attempting to secure immunity for u.s. soldiers , fearing that they may become victims of politically-motivated prosecutions .
meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .
this move by the europeans greatly angered washington . what 's more , questions still remain over the validity of claims made by the united states and britain about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
in a recent interview with the magazine vanity fair , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz was quoted as saying that the united states concentrated on the issue of weapons of mass destruction because it was likely to garner the most support , although - from the american standpoint - it was never a primary reason for war . rumsfeld subsequently stated that he had every confidence weapons of mass destruction would be uncovered in iraq .
when struck was asked by the zdf morning news program whether or not he would address the issue during his meeting with rumsfeld today , struck replied that he would n't .
" but it would be interesting to see what the american 's had to say , " he said . rumsfeld is in the midst of a four day trip to europe , including stops in portugal , albania , germany , and brussels .

at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments . u.s. and german defense ministers donald rumsfeld and peter struck met in germany during rumsfeld 's first trip to the country since the end of the war in iraq .
at a meeting with the press , rumsfeld indicated that german-american relations were " on their way to a point of normalcy . "
but his subsequent comments , repeating his controversial division between " old europe " and " new europe , " ruffled feathers at a time when many transatlantic issues remain unresolved . the two came together at the tenth anniversary celebration for the george c. marshall center in garmisch-partenkirchen , a security-studies institute funded by both the united states and germany .
both gave speeches and then met briefly to discuss issues at the top of the transatlantic security agenda , including the enlarged participation of german forces in peace-keeping and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan .
rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .
" we agree that it is time to look forward - and not back , " said struck . a transatlantic thaw ? although this represents rumsfeld 's first trip to germany since the start of the war in iraq , it is his second meeting with struck in as many months .
struck traveled to washington in early may to meet with rumsfeld - his trip was the start of an offensive effort -lrb- on the part of both sides -rrb- to overcome the divisions over iraq . struck 's trip to washington was followed by a round of high-level diplomatic meetings and carefully planned photo opportunities , designed to convey the message that both sides were moving on .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell visited germany just a week later and , at the end of the month , president george w. bush approached german chancellor gerhard schröder at the 300th anniversary celebrations in russia and again at the g-8 meeting in evian .
most recently , president bush called chancellor schröder to express his sympathies over the loss of german soldiers in afghanistan . before struck met with rumsfeld in may , he was optimistic about the chances for reconciliation , stating that he had always gotten on well with his u.s.-counterpart and predicting that the matter would be addressed in a matter of minutes .
" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "
one month later , it 's not clear if making-up will be that easy . lingering tensions tensions remain , most recently surfacing during the debate over the international criminal court .
the bush administration has been attempting to secure immunity for u.s. soldiers , fearing that they may become victims of politically-motivated prosecutions .
meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .
this move by the europeans greatly angered washington . what 's more , questions still remain over the validity of claims made by the united states and britain about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
in a recent interview with the magazine vanity fair , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz was quoted as saying that the united states concentrated on the issue of weapons of mass destruction because it was likely to garner the most support , although - from the american standpoint - it was never a primary reason for war . rumsfeld subsequently stated that he had every confidence weapons of mass destruction would be uncovered in iraq .
when struck was asked by the zdf morning news program whether or not he would address the issue during his meeting with rumsfeld today , struck replied that he would n't .
" but it would be interesting to see what the american 's had to say , " he said . rumsfeld is in the midst of a four day trip to europe , including stops in portugal , albania , germany , and brussels .
on thursday , he is scheduled to arrive in brussels , where he will meet with other nato defence ministers to discuss a possible redesign of the north atlantic treaty organization structures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2003 german unions : good guys or reform blockers ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall union members recently voted to expand their strikes .
across eastern germany , metalworkers and engineers have laid down their tools , striking for a shorter work week .
can germany afford to give in to union pressure ? thirteen years after reunification , employees at eastern german car , steel and machine tools factories in the former communist states work 38 hours a week - three more than their western counterparts do for the same wage .
for the past week they have been on strike , trying to close that gap . but business leaders say eastern productivity still lags behind and some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist part of germany .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce . instigated by the mighty ig metall trade union when many easterns are looking for work , the strike has caused some to question whether organized labor wields too much power .
recent opinion polls show that increasing numbers of germans agree that their government must scale back its generous social welfare system in order to awake from its economic slumber . but the unions have remained staunchly opposed , determined to defend the welfare state they spent decades helping to erect .
instead , the unions advocate a plan calling for increased public spending in order to stimulate the economy . new attitudes toward unions their resistance to reform has led many germans to turn their back on organized labor .
union membership has dropped to 7.7 million last year , from 11.8 million in 1991 .
and a recent infratest poll showed that 50 percent of germans now say union power should be curbed , versus only 26 percent who think their influence should rise - the exact reverse of four years ago . with the germany economy currently in such a precarious state , the latest strike runs the risk of even further isolating the unions from the public at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " opposition christian democrat party leader angela merkel recently told ard television last month . unions in germany not only exercise their power through demonstrations and work stoppages .
they also can count 80 percent of the social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- federal parliamentarians as members . " in order to placate the unions , the social democratic party sought union-backed candidates during the last elections , to ensure that union people were actively involved in the party , " said political scientist hans-peter müller . the strong union presence in government means it is sometimes hard for german chancellor gerhard schröder to push through his economic reform agenda , and an ever-widening rift has formed between the spd and its once die-hard constituency . as german growth has stalled , schröder ’ s government has begun attempting to push through desperately needed reforms to the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and its inflexible labor market .
while the government is now opposing organized labor , only a few years ago it was toeing the union line . a good example is the issue of job security .
during the last parliament , schröder 's government amended a law making it harder to fire workers in response to union pressure .
because of the dire economic situation , however , the law is once again on the table . worker participation in the early days of the west germany , the unions ' goal was to achieve worker participation in industry .
they quickly became a force to be reckoned with , and step by step they achieved cuts in working hours and broke the employers ' right to dictate wage levels . since the 1950s , unions have grown to hold at least a third of the seats on german companies ' supervisory boards .
in the coal and steel industry , they hold a good half of the seats on every such board . in the current labor dispute rocking eastern germany , one steel company , eko stahl in eisenhütten near the polish border , has already acquiesced to workers ' demands . it granted the 35 hour week in order to get production up and running as quickly as possible . ralf koehler , the representative of ig metall at eko stahl , says the 35 hour week is fair .
" economically , we 've been making a profit for years .
the company is earning millions of euros and we want our just share , " he said . other workers are more in line with the government than their own union , however .
jörg heymann , a maschinist at eko stahl , opposed the strike . " -lrb- keeping -rrb- my job is more important , regardless of the hours , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east .

at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments . u.s. and german defense ministers donald rumsfeld and peter struck met in germany during rumsfeld 's first trip to the country since the end of the war in iraq .
at a meeting with the press , rumsfeld indicated that german-american relations were " on their way to a point of normalcy . "
but his subsequent comments , repeating his controversial division between " old europe " and " new europe , " ruffled feathers at a time when many transatlantic issues remain unresolved . the two came together at the tenth anniversary celebration for the george c. marshall center in garmisch-partenkirchen , a security-studies institute funded by both the united states and germany .
both gave speeches and then met briefly to discuss issues at the top of the transatlantic security agenda , including the enlarged participation of german forces in peace-keeping and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan .
rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .
" we agree that it is time to look forward - and not back , " said struck . a transatlantic thaw ? although this represents rumsfeld 's first trip to germany since the start of the war in iraq , it is his second meeting with struck in as many months .
struck traveled to washington in early may to meet with rumsfeld - his trip was the start of an offensive effort -lrb- on the part of both sides -rrb- to overcome the divisions over iraq . struck 's trip to washington was followed by a round of high-level diplomatic meetings and carefully planned photo opportunities , designed to convey the message that both sides were moving on .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell visited germany just a week later and , at the end of the month , president george w. bush approached german chancellor gerhard schröder at the 300th anniversary celebrations in russia and again at the g-8 meeting in evian .
most recently , president bush called chancellor schröder to express his sympathies over the loss of german soldiers in afghanistan . before struck met with rumsfeld in may , he was optimistic about the chances for reconciliation , stating that he had always gotten on well with his u.s.-counterpart and predicting that the matter would be addressed in a matter of minutes .
" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "
one month later , it 's not clear if making-up will be that easy . lingering tensions tensions remain , most recently surfacing during the debate over the international criminal court .
the bush administration has been attempting to secure immunity for u.s. soldiers , fearing that they may become victims of politically-motivated prosecutions .
meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .
this move by the europeans greatly angered washington . what 's more , questions still remain over the validity of claims made by the united states and britain about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
in a recent interview with the magazine vanity fair , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz was quoted as saying that the united states concentrated on the issue of weapons of mass destruction because it was likely to garner the most support , although - from the american standpoint - it was never a primary reason for war . rumsfeld subsequently stated that he had every confidence weapons of mass destruction would be uncovered in iraq .
when struck was asked by the zdf morning news program whether or not he would address the issue during his meeting with rumsfeld today , struck replied that he would n't .
" but it would be interesting to see what the american 's had to say , " he said . rumsfeld is in the midst of a four day trip to europe , including stops in portugal , albania , germany , and brussels .

there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw " mcberti " takes on his former team german players pessimistic ahead of italy clash culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.06.2003 reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walk the walk but do n't talk the talk : rudi völler -lrb- left -rrb- and michael ballack in training .
everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .
but instead of playing up to the role of favorites , the german camp is towing the regular party line of near silence .
germans giving nothing away as much as the germans like to celebrate their regular successes on the international soccer scene , they are a reticent bunch when the outcome of the competition has yet to be decided .
in typical fashion , the germans refused to build themselves up before the scotland game on saturday , despite being the stronger team on paper , and are typically tight-lipped about their chances against the faroes .
it seems the safest option .
the refusal to blow their own trumpet has every angle covered - win , lose or draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose looks forward to facing the faroe islands .
so far , no one can be pinned down on the way they expect the game to go .
midfielder michael ballack refused to comment on the possible result at a recent press conference and instead directed some diplomatic yet thinly- veiled criticism to stir his team mates ahead of the clash by saying , " some of the players must realize what it means to play for germany and act accordingly . "
meanwhile striker miroslav klose took the easy way out and played dumb when quizzed on germany 's opponents : " all i know is there 's plenty of sheep with mountains in the background . "
proceed with caution ?
although expectation within the sport was high of a crushing german victory over mcberti and his team of brave scots ; as usual none of it seemed to emanate from the german players themselves .
and while there were no words to come back to haunt them after finishing the match with a single point , the apparent caution in their media approach was extended to their display on the pitch .
the germans seemed to balk at the tenacity of scotland and at times looked overawed by the support from the crowd inside the cauldron of noise that was hampden park .
chances are , however , that the germans will overcome the part-timers of the faroes on wednesday to top group five and keep their chances of automatic qualification for the european championships in portugal next summer well and truly alive .
but then again , as the germans seem to acknowledge more than most , nothing can be taken for granted .
that elusive emphatic win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tight-lipped : völler and skibbe the last time the two teams met was in hanover last october .
the germans were once again expected to put the faroes to the sword but stuttered in front of their own supporters and made a 2:1 victory look like a lucky escape .
the effect of failing to hit double figures on the back of a successful world cup campaign in japan / south korea was evident in coach völler 's stunned reaction to the narrow victory : " it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . "
again , well said rudi ...
völler and his boys may be contemplating another fierce encounter on wednesday , for what the faroes lack in technical skill , they more than make up for in enthusiasm and passion for the game .
despite being stuck at the bottom of group five with one point after a 2:1 defeat by iceland on saturday , the islanders are likely to rise to the challenge posed by the three time world and european champions .
islands of soccer passion although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , nearly one in every eight islanders is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
as a result , every game against a major soccer force is a championship final and the players take to the field as if the world cup itself was the prize to be won at the end of it .
maybe a bit more fire and commitment like that would n't go amiss for the stoical germans come wednesday night . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scotland-germany match ends in 1-1 draw saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.06.2003 blueprint of european constitution expected friday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working out the details : eu convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is wrapping his blueprint for a constitution .
there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .
even if the delegates fail to find agreement on the remaining sticky issues , they still plan to submit a blueprint at next friday 's summit .
after that they 'll still have three more weeks to fine tune the language before handing the final draft over to the incoming italian presidency on july 18 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu convention reaches compromise the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .
european double standard ?
the u.s. effort has encountered stiff resistance from european allies , who believe that the terms set by the united states would undermine the power of the court before it has tried its first case .
for their part , the americans accuse the europeans of exercising a double standard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peacekeepers in afghanistan are protected from prosecution by international agreements .
britain , france and other european governments have signed such agreements with afghanistan , shielding thousands of european peacekeepers from surrender by afghan authorities to the hague-based court .
the united states accused the 15-member european union of actively lobbying countries , including the 10 future members of the union , not to sign the u.s.-drafted agreements .
the confidential memo warned that recent improvement in relations with france , germany and other countries that opposed the war in iraq could be undone .
summit in danger " this will undercut all our efforts to repair and rebuild the transatlantic relationship just as we are taking a turn for the better after a number of difficult months , " the confidential memo , known as a démarche , reads .
" we are dismayed that the european union would actively seek to undermine u.s. efforts . "
the dispute may come to a head at a planned summit of european and u.s. leaders in washington on june 25 .
security council vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.n. wants to avoid a split like that over the iraq war .
despite opposition , the resolution to extend the immunity is expected to pass the security council easily on thursday .
the u.n. is extremely wary of entering into yet another fray with the white house , following the debacle over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq earlier this year .
still unclear is whether germany and france will show their opposition to the u.s. stance by abstaining from the vote .
last year 's vote was 15-0 after the united states threatened to veto u.n. peacekeeping missions .
canada seeks debate four key advocates for the court that do not have council seats - canada , switzerland new zealand and jordan – have asked for an open debate on the international criminal court ; this debate may also take place on thursday .
canada 's ambassador to the u.n. , paul heinbecker , said : " we would like to have the opportunity to register our support for the court .
we see it as bringing accountability to the worst tyrants and the perpetrators of crime . "
taking criminals to court as the first permanent global criminal court , the icc was set up to try individuals for the world 's worst atrocities - genocide , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses - in a belated effort to fulfill the promise of the nuremberg trials 57 years ago that prosecuted nazi leaders .
among the court 's chief advocates are european union nations , especially germany , which joined the council this year .
a total of 90 countries have so far ratified the treaty , including all 15 eu member states .

everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.06.2003 blueprint of european constitution expected friday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working out the details : eu convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is wrapping his blueprint for a constitution .
there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .
even if the delegates fail to find agreement on the remaining sticky issues , they still plan to submit a blueprint at next friday 's summit .
after that they 'll still have three more weeks to fine tune the language before handing the final draft over to the incoming italian presidency on july 18 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu convention reaches compromise the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit .

everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .
but instead of playing up to the role of favorites , the german camp is towing the regular party line of near silence .
germans giving nothing away as much as the germans like to celebrate their regular successes on the international soccer scene , they are a reticent bunch when the outcome of the competition has yet to be decided .
in typical fashion , the germans refused to build themselves up before the scotland game on saturday , despite being the stronger team on paper , and are typically tight-lipped about their chances against the faroes .
it seems the safest option .
the refusal to blow their own trumpet has every angle covered - win , lose or draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose looks forward to facing the faroe islands .
so far , no one can be pinned down on the way they expect the game to go .
midfielder michael ballack refused to comment on the possible result at a recent press conference and instead directed some diplomatic yet thinly- veiled criticism to stir his team mates ahead of the clash by saying , " some of the players must realize what it means to play for germany and act accordingly . "
meanwhile striker miroslav klose took the easy way out and played dumb when quizzed on germany 's opponents : " all i know is there 's plenty of sheep with mountains in the background . "
proceed with caution ?
although expectation within the sport was high of a crushing german victory over mcberti and his team of brave scots ; as usual none of it seemed to emanate from the german players themselves .
and while there were no words to come back to haunt them after finishing the match with a single point , the apparent caution in their media approach was extended to their display on the pitch .
the germans seemed to balk at the tenacity of scotland and at times looked overawed by the support from the crowd inside the cauldron of noise that was hampden park .
chances are , however , that the germans will overcome the part-timers of the faroes on wednesday to top group five and keep their chances of automatic qualification for the european championships in portugal next summer well and truly alive .
but then again , as the germans seem to acknowledge more than most , nothing can be taken for granted .
that elusive emphatic win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tight-lipped : völler and skibbe the last time the two teams met was in hanover last october .
the germans were once again expected to put the faroes to the sword but stuttered in front of their own supporters and made a 2:1 victory look like a lucky escape .
the effect of failing to hit double figures on the back of a successful world cup campaign in japan / south korea was evident in coach völler 's stunned reaction to the narrow victory : " it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . "
again , well said rudi ...
völler and his boys may be contemplating another fierce encounter on wednesday , for what the faroes lack in technical skill , they more than make up for in enthusiasm and passion for the game .
despite being stuck at the bottom of group five with one point after a 2:1 defeat by iceland on saturday , the islanders are likely to rise to the challenge posed by the three time world and european champions .
islands of soccer passion although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , nearly one in every eight islanders is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
as a result , every game against a major soccer force is a championship final and the players take to the field as if the world cup itself was the prize to be won at the end of it .
maybe a bit more fire and commitment like that would n't go amiss for the stoical germans come wednesday night . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scotland-germany match ends in 1-1 draw saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way .

there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .
even if the delegates fail to find agreement on the remaining sticky issues , they still plan to submit a blueprint at next friday 's summit .
after that they 'll still have three more weeks to fine tune the language before handing the final draft over to the incoming italian presidency on july 18 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu convention reaches compromise the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .
european double standard ?
the u.s. effort has encountered stiff resistance from european allies , who believe that the terms set by the united states would undermine the power of the court before it has tried its first case .
for their part , the americans accuse the europeans of exercising a double standard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peacekeepers in afghanistan are protected from prosecution by international agreements .
britain , france and other european governments have signed such agreements with afghanistan , shielding thousands of european peacekeepers from surrender by afghan authorities to the hague-based court .
the united states accused the 15-member european union of actively lobbying countries , including the 10 future members of the union , not to sign the u.s.-drafted agreements .
the confidential memo warned that recent improvement in relations with france , germany and other countries that opposed the war in iraq could be undone .
summit in danger " this will undercut all our efforts to repair and rebuild the transatlantic relationship just as we are taking a turn for the better after a number of difficult months , " the confidential memo , known as a démarche , reads .
" we are dismayed that the european union would actively seek to undermine u.s. efforts . "
the dispute may come to a head at a planned summit of european and u.s. leaders in washington on june 25 .
security council vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.n. wants to avoid a split like that over the iraq war .
despite opposition , the resolution to extend the immunity is expected to pass the security council easily on thursday .
the u.n. is extremely wary of entering into yet another fray with the white house , following the debacle over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq earlier this year .
still unclear is whether germany and france will show their opposition to the u.s. stance by abstaining from the vote .
last year 's vote was 15-0 after the united states threatened to veto u.n. peacekeeping missions .
canada seeks debate four key advocates for the court that do not have council seats - canada , switzerland new zealand and jordan – have asked for an open debate on the international criminal court ; this debate may also take place on thursday .
canada 's ambassador to the u.n. , paul heinbecker , said : " we would like to have the opportunity to register our support for the court .
we see it as bringing accountability to the worst tyrants and the perpetrators of crime . "
taking criminals to court as the first permanent global criminal court , the icc was set up to try individuals for the world 's worst atrocities - genocide , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses - in a belated effort to fulfill the promise of the nuremberg trials 57 years ago that prosecuted nazi leaders .
among the court 's chief advocates are european union nations , especially germany , which joined the council this year .
a total of 90 countries have so far ratified the treaty , including all 15 eu member states .

across eastern germany , metalworkers and engineers have laid down their tools , striking for a shorter work week .
can germany afford to give in to union pressure ? thirteen years after reunification , employees at eastern german car , steel and machine tools factories in the former communist states work 38 hours a week - three more than their western counterparts do for the same wage .
for the past week they have been on strike , trying to close that gap . but business leaders say eastern productivity still lags behind and some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist part of germany .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce . instigated by the mighty ig metall trade union when many easterns are looking for work , the strike has caused some to question whether organized labor wields too much power .
recent opinion polls show that increasing numbers of germans agree that their government must scale back its generous social welfare system in order to awake from its economic slumber . but the unions have remained staunchly opposed , determined to defend the welfare state they spent decades helping to erect .
instead , the unions advocate a plan calling for increased public spending in order to stimulate the economy . new attitudes toward unions their resistance to reform has led many germans to turn their back on organized labor .
union membership has dropped to 7.7 million last year , from 11.8 million in 1991 .
and a recent infratest poll showed that 50 percent of germans now say union power should be curbed , versus only 26 percent who think their influence should rise - the exact reverse of four years ago . with the germany economy currently in such a precarious state , the latest strike runs the risk of even further isolating the unions from the public at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " opposition christian democrat party leader angela merkel recently told ard television last month . unions in germany not only exercise their power through demonstrations and work stoppages .
they also can count 80 percent of the social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- federal parliamentarians as members . " in order to placate the unions , the social democratic party sought union-backed candidates during the last elections , to ensure that union people were actively involved in the party , " said political scientist hans-peter müller . the strong union presence in government means it is sometimes hard for german chancellor gerhard schröder to push through his economic reform agenda , and an ever-widening rift has formed between the spd and its once die-hard constituency . as german growth has stalled , schröder ’ s government has begun attempting to push through desperately needed reforms to the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and its inflexible labor market .
while the government is now opposing organized labor , only a few years ago it was toeing the union line . a good example is the issue of job security .
during the last parliament , schröder 's government amended a law making it harder to fire workers in response to union pressure .
because of the dire economic situation , however , the law is once again on the table . worker participation in the early days of the west germany , the unions ' goal was to achieve worker participation in industry .
they quickly became a force to be reckoned with , and step by step they achieved cuts in working hours and broke the employers ' right to dictate wage levels . since the 1950s , unions have grown to hold at least a third of the seats on german companies ' supervisory boards .
in the coal and steel industry , they hold a good half of the seats on every such board . in the current labor dispute rocking eastern germany , one steel company , eko stahl in eisenhütten near the polish border , has already acquiesced to workers ' demands . it granted the 35 hour week in order to get production up and running as quickly as possible . ralf koehler , the representative of ig metall at eko stahl , says the 35 hour week is fair .
" economically , we 've been making a profit for years .
the company is earning millions of euros and we want our just share , " he said . other workers are more in line with the government than their own union , however .
jörg heymann , a maschinist at eko stahl , opposed the strike .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .
european double standard ?
the u.s. effort has encountered stiff resistance from european allies , who believe that the terms set by the united states would undermine the power of the court before it has tried its first case .
for their part , the americans accuse the europeans of exercising a double standard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peacekeepers in afghanistan are protected from prosecution by international agreements .
britain , france and other european governments have signed such agreements with afghanistan , shielding thousands of european peacekeepers from surrender by afghan authorities to the hague-based court .
the united states accused the 15-member european union of actively lobbying countries , including the 10 future members of the union , not to sign the u.s.-drafted agreements .
the confidential memo warned that recent improvement in relations with france , germany and other countries that opposed the war in iraq could be undone .
summit in danger " this will undercut all our efforts to repair and rebuild the transatlantic relationship just as we are taking a turn for the better after a number of difficult months , " the confidential memo , known as a démarche , reads .
" we are dismayed that the european union would actively seek to undermine u.s. efforts . "
the dispute may come to a head at a planned summit of european and u.s. leaders in washington on june 25 .
security council vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.n. wants to avoid a split like that over the iraq war .
despite opposition , the resolution to extend the immunity is expected to pass the security council easily on thursday .
the u.n. is extremely wary of entering into yet another fray with the white house , following the debacle over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq earlier this year .
still unclear is whether germany and france will show their opposition to the u.s. stance by abstaining from the vote .
last year 's vote was 15-0 after the united states threatened to veto u.n. peacekeeping missions .
canada seeks debate four key advocates for the court that do not have council seats - canada , switzerland new zealand and jordan – have asked for an open debate on the international criminal court ; this debate may also take place on thursday .
canada 's ambassador to the u.n. , paul heinbecker , said : " we would like to have the opportunity to register our support for the court .
we see it as bringing accountability to the worst tyrants and the perpetrators of crime . "
taking criminals to court as the first permanent global criminal court , the icc was set up to try individuals for the world 's worst atrocities - genocide , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses - in a belated effort to fulfill the promise of the nuremberg trials 57 years ago that prosecuted nazi leaders .
among the court 's chief advocates are european union nations , especially germany , which joined the council this year .
a total of 90 countries have so far ratified the treaty , including all 15 eu member states .

everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .
but instead of playing up to the role of favorites , the german camp is towing the regular party line of near silence .
germans giving nothing away as much as the germans like to celebrate their regular successes on the international soccer scene , they are a reticent bunch when the outcome of the competition has yet to be decided .
in typical fashion , the germans refused to build themselves up before the scotland game on saturday , despite being the stronger team on paper , and are typically tight-lipped about their chances against the faroes .

"
meanwhile striker miroslav klose took the easy way out and played dumb when quizzed on germany 's opponents : " all i know is there 's plenty of sheep with mountains in the background . "
proceed with caution ?
although expectation within the sport was high of a crushing german victory over mcberti and his team of brave scots ; as usual none of it seemed to emanate from the german players themselves .
and while there were no words to come back to haunt them after finishing the match with a single point , the apparent caution in their media approach was extended to their display on the pitch .
the germans seemed to balk at the tenacity of scotland and at times looked overawed by the support from the crowd inside the cauldron of noise that was hampden park .
chances are , however , that the germans will overcome the part-timers of the faroes on wednesday to top group five and keep their chances of automatic qualification for the european championships in portugal next summer well and truly alive .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.06.2003 blueprint of european constitution expected friday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working out the details : eu convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is wrapping his blueprint for a constitution .
there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .
even if the delegates fail to find agreement on the remaining sticky issues , they still plan to submit a blueprint at next friday 's summit .
after that they 'll still have three more weeks to fine tune the language before handing the final draft over to the incoming italian presidency on july 18 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu convention reaches compromise the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit .

there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .
even if the delegates fail to find agreement on the remaining sticky issues , they still plan to submit a blueprint at next friday 's summit .
after that they 'll still have three more weeks to fine tune the language before handing the final draft over to the incoming italian presidency on july 18 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu convention reaches compromise the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .

u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .
european double standard ?
the u.s. effort has encountered stiff resistance from european allies , who believe that the terms set by the united states would undermine the power of the court before it has tried its first case .
for their part , the americans accuse the europeans of exercising a double standard .

britain , france and other european governments have signed such agreements with afghanistan , shielding thousands of european peacekeepers from surrender by afghan authorities to the hague-based court .
the united states accused the 15-member european union of actively lobbying countries , including the 10 future members of the union , not to sign the u.s.-drafted agreements .
the confidential memo warned that recent improvement in relations with france , germany and other countries that opposed the war in iraq could be undone .
summit in danger " this will undercut all our efforts to repair and rebuild the transatlantic relationship just as we are taking a turn for the better after a number of difficult months , " the confidential memo , known as a démarche , reads .
" we are dismayed that the european union would actively seek to undermine u.s. efforts . "
the dispute may come to a head at a planned summit of european and u.s. leaders in washington on june 25 .
security council vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.n. wants to avoid a split like that over the iraq war .
despite opposition , the resolution to extend the immunity is expected to pass the security council easily on thursday .
the u.n. is extremely wary of entering into yet another fray with the white house , following the debacle over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq earlier this year .
still unclear is whether germany and france will show their opposition to the u.s. stance by abstaining from the vote .
last year 's vote was 15-0 after the united states threatened to veto u.n. peacekeeping missions .
canada seeks debate four key advocates for the court that do not have council seats - canada , switzerland new zealand and jordan – have asked for an open debate on the international criminal court ; this debate may also take place on thursday .
canada 's ambassador to the u.n. , paul heinbecker , said : " we would like to have the opportunity to register our support for the court .
we see it as bringing accountability to the worst tyrants and the perpetrators of crime . "
taking criminals to court as the first permanent global criminal court , the icc was set up to try individuals for the world 's worst atrocities - genocide , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses - in a belated effort to fulfill the promise of the nuremberg trials 57 years ago that prosecuted nazi leaders .
among the court 's chief advocates are european union nations , especially germany , which joined the council this year .

at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments . u.s. and german defense ministers donald rumsfeld and peter struck met in germany during rumsfeld 's first trip to the country since the end of the war in iraq .
at a meeting with the press , rumsfeld indicated that german-american relations were " on their way to a point of normalcy . "
but his subsequent comments , repeating his controversial division between " old europe " and " new europe , " ruffled feathers at a time when many transatlantic issues remain unresolved . the two came together at the tenth anniversary celebration for the george c. marshall center in garmisch-partenkirchen , a security-studies institute funded by both the united states and germany .

rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .
" we agree that it is time to look forward - and not back , " said struck . a transatlantic thaw ? although this represents rumsfeld 's first trip to germany since the start of the war in iraq , it is his second meeting with struck in as many months .

most recently , president bush called chancellor schröder to express his sympathies over the loss of german soldiers in afghanistan . before struck met with rumsfeld in may , he was optimistic about the chances for reconciliation , stating that he had always gotten on well with his u.s.-counterpart and predicting that the matter would be addressed in a matter of minutes .
" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "

meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.06.2003 blueprint of european constitution expected friday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working out the details : eu convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is wrapping his blueprint for a constitution .
there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .
even if the delegates fail to find agreement on the remaining sticky issues , they still plan to submit a blueprint at next friday 's summit .
after that they 'll still have three more weeks to fine tune the language before handing the final draft over to the incoming italian presidency on july 18 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu convention reaches compromise the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit .

there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .
even if the delegates fail to find agreement on the remaining sticky issues , they still plan to submit a blueprint at next friday 's summit .
after that they 'll still have three more weeks to fine tune the language before handing the final draft over to the incoming italian presidency on july 18 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu convention reaches compromise the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw " mcberti " takes on his former team german players pessimistic ahead of italy clash culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.06.2003 reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walk the walk but do n't talk the talk : rudi völler -lrb- left -rrb- and michael ballack in training .
everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .
but instead of playing up to the role of favorites , the german camp is towing the regular party line of near silence .
germans giving nothing away as much as the germans like to celebrate their regular successes on the international soccer scene , they are a reticent bunch when the outcome of the competition has yet to be decided .
in typical fashion , the germans refused to build themselves up before the scotland game on saturday , despite being the stronger team on paper , and are typically tight-lipped about their chances against the faroes .
it seems the safest option .
the refusal to blow their own trumpet has every angle covered - win , lose or draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose looks forward to facing the faroe islands .
so far , no one can be pinned down on the way they expect the game to go .
midfielder michael ballack refused to comment on the possible result at a recent press conference and instead directed some diplomatic yet thinly- veiled criticism to stir his team mates ahead of the clash by saying , " some of the players must realize what it means to play for germany and act accordingly . "
meanwhile striker miroslav klose took the easy way out and played dumb when quizzed on germany 's opponents : " all i know is there 's plenty of sheep with mountains in the background . "
proceed with caution ?
although expectation within the sport was high of a crushing german victory over mcberti and his team of brave scots ; as usual none of it seemed to emanate from the german players themselves .
and while there were no words to come back to haunt them after finishing the match with a single point , the apparent caution in their media approach was extended to their display on the pitch .
the germans seemed to balk at the tenacity of scotland and at times looked overawed by the support from the crowd inside the cauldron of noise that was hampden park .
chances are , however , that the germans will overcome the part-timers of the faroes on wednesday to top group five and keep their chances of automatic qualification for the european championships in portugal next summer well and truly alive .
but then again , as the germans seem to acknowledge more than most , nothing can be taken for granted .
that elusive emphatic win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tight-lipped : völler and skibbe the last time the two teams met was in hanover last october .
the germans were once again expected to put the faroes to the sword but stuttered in front of their own supporters and made a 2:1 victory look like a lucky escape .
the effect of failing to hit double figures on the back of a successful world cup campaign in japan / south korea was evident in coach völler 's stunned reaction to the narrow victory : " it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . "
again , well said rudi ...
völler and his boys may be contemplating another fierce encounter on wednesday , for what the faroes lack in technical skill , they more than make up for in enthusiasm and passion for the game .
despite being stuck at the bottom of group five with one point after a 2:1 defeat by iceland on saturday , the islanders are likely to rise to the challenge posed by the three time world and european champions .
islands of soccer passion although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , nearly one in every eight islanders is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
as a result , every game against a major soccer force is a championship final and the players take to the field as if the world cup itself was the prize to be won at the end of it .

at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments . u.s. and german defense ministers donald rumsfeld and peter struck met in germany during rumsfeld 's first trip to the country since the end of the war in iraq .
at a meeting with the press , rumsfeld indicated that german-american relations were " on their way to a point of normalcy . "
but his subsequent comments , repeating his controversial division between " old europe " and " new europe , " ruffled feathers at a time when many transatlantic issues remain unresolved . the two came together at the tenth anniversary celebration for the george c. marshall center in garmisch-partenkirchen , a security-studies institute funded by both the united states and germany .
both gave speeches and then met briefly to discuss issues at the top of the transatlantic security agenda , including the enlarged participation of german forces in peace-keeping and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan .
rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .
" we agree that it is time to look forward - and not back , " said struck . a transatlantic thaw ? although this represents rumsfeld 's first trip to germany since the start of the war in iraq , it is his second meeting with struck in as many months .
struck traveled to washington in early may to meet with rumsfeld - his trip was the start of an offensive effort -lrb- on the part of both sides -rrb- to overcome the divisions over iraq . struck 's trip to washington was followed by a round of high-level diplomatic meetings and carefully planned photo opportunities , designed to convey the message that both sides were moving on .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell visited germany just a week later and , at the end of the month , president george w. bush approached german chancellor gerhard schröder at the 300th anniversary celebrations in russia and again at the g-8 meeting in evian .
most recently , president bush called chancellor schröder to express his sympathies over the loss of german soldiers in afghanistan . before struck met with rumsfeld in may , he was optimistic about the chances for reconciliation , stating that he had always gotten on well with his u.s.-counterpart and predicting that the matter would be addressed in a matter of minutes .
" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "
one month later , it 's not clear if making-up will be that easy . lingering tensions tensions remain , most recently surfacing during the debate over the international criminal court .
the bush administration has been attempting to secure immunity for u.s. soldiers , fearing that they may become victims of politically-motivated prosecutions .
meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .
this move by the europeans greatly angered washington . what 's more , questions still remain over the validity of claims made by the united states and britain about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
in a recent interview with the magazine vanity fair , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz was quoted as saying that the united states concentrated on the issue of weapons of mass destruction because it was likely to garner the most support , although - from the american standpoint - it was never a primary reason for war . rumsfeld subsequently stated that he had every confidence weapons of mass destruction would be uncovered in iraq .
when struck was asked by the zdf morning news program whether or not he would address the issue during his meeting with rumsfeld today , struck replied that he would n't .
" but it would be interesting to see what the american 's had to say , " he said . rumsfeld is in the midst of a four day trip to europe , including stops in portugal , albania , germany , and brussels .
on thursday , he is scheduled to arrive in brussels , where he will meet with other nato defence ministers to discuss a possible redesign of the north atlantic treaty organization structures .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .
european double standard ?
the u.s. effort has encountered stiff resistance from european allies , who believe that the terms set by the united states would undermine the power of the court before it has tried its first case .
for their part , the americans accuse the europeans of exercising a double standard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peacekeepers in afghanistan are protected from prosecution by international agreements .
britain , france and other european governments have signed such agreements with afghanistan , shielding thousands of european peacekeepers from surrender by afghan authorities to the hague-based court .
the united states accused the 15-member european union of actively lobbying countries , including the 10 future members of the union , not to sign the u.s.-drafted agreements .
the confidential memo warned that recent improvement in relations with france , germany and other countries that opposed the war in iraq could be undone .
summit in danger " this will undercut all our efforts to repair and rebuild the transatlantic relationship just as we are taking a turn for the better after a number of difficult months , " the confidential memo , known as a démarche , reads .
" we are dismayed that the european union would actively seek to undermine u.s. efforts . "
the dispute may come to a head at a planned summit of european and u.s. leaders in washington on june 25 .
security council vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.n. wants to avoid a split like that over the iraq war .
despite opposition , the resolution to extend the immunity is expected to pass the security council easily on thursday .
the u.n. is extremely wary of entering into yet another fray with the white house , following the debacle over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq earlier this year .
still unclear is whether germany and france will show their opposition to the u.s. stance by abstaining from the vote .
last year 's vote was 15-0 after the united states threatened to veto u.n. peacekeeping missions .
canada seeks debate four key advocates for the court that do not have council seats - canada , switzerland new zealand and jordan – have asked for an open debate on the international criminal court ; this debate may also take place on thursday .
canada 's ambassador to the u.n. , paul heinbecker , said : " we would like to have the opportunity to register our support for the court .
we see it as bringing accountability to the worst tyrants and the perpetrators of crime . "
taking criminals to court as the first permanent global criminal court , the icc was set up to try individuals for the world 's worst atrocities - genocide , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses - in a belated effort to fulfill the promise of the nuremberg trials 57 years ago that prosecuted nazi leaders .
among the court 's chief advocates are european union nations , especially germany , which joined the council this year .
a total of 90 countries have so far ratified the treaty , including all 15 eu member states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 11.06.2003 blueprint of european constitution expected friday großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working out the details : eu convention president valery giscard d 'estaing is wrapping his blueprint for a constitution .
there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .
even if the delegates fail to find agreement on the remaining sticky issues , they still plan to submit a blueprint at next friday 's summit .
after that they 'll still have three more weeks to fine tune the language before handing the final draft over to the incoming italian presidency on july 18 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu convention reaches compromise the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw " mcberti " takes on his former team german players pessimistic ahead of italy clash culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.06.2003 reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walk the walk but do n't talk the talk : rudi völler -lrb- left -rrb- and michael ballack in training .
everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .
but instead of playing up to the role of favorites , the german camp is towing the regular party line of near silence .
germans giving nothing away as much as the germans like to celebrate their regular successes on the international soccer scene , they are a reticent bunch when the outcome of the competition has yet to be decided .
in typical fashion , the germans refused to build themselves up before the scotland game on saturday , despite being the stronger team on paper , and are typically tight-lipped about their chances against the faroes .
it seems the safest option .
the refusal to blow their own trumpet has every angle covered - win , lose or draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose looks forward to facing the faroe islands .
so far , no one can be pinned down on the way they expect the game to go .
midfielder michael ballack refused to comment on the possible result at a recent press conference and instead directed some diplomatic yet thinly- veiled criticism to stir his team mates ahead of the clash by saying , " some of the players must realize what it means to play for germany and act accordingly . "
meanwhile striker miroslav klose took the easy way out and played dumb when quizzed on germany 's opponents : " all i know is there 's plenty of sheep with mountains in the background . "
proceed with caution ?
although expectation within the sport was high of a crushing german victory over mcberti and his team of brave scots ; as usual none of it seemed to emanate from the german players themselves .
and while there were no words to come back to haunt them after finishing the match with a single point , the apparent caution in their media approach was extended to their display on the pitch .
the germans seemed to balk at the tenacity of scotland and at times looked overawed by the support from the crowd inside the cauldron of noise that was hampden park .
chances are , however , that the germans will overcome the part-timers of the faroes on wednesday to top group five and keep their chances of automatic qualification for the european championships in portugal next summer well and truly alive .
but then again , as the germans seem to acknowledge more than most , nothing can be taken for granted .
that elusive emphatic win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tight-lipped : völler and skibbe the last time the two teams met was in hanover last october .
the germans were once again expected to put the faroes to the sword but stuttered in front of their own supporters and made a 2:1 victory look like a lucky escape .
the effect of failing to hit double figures on the back of a successful world cup campaign in japan / south korea was evident in coach völler 's stunned reaction to the narrow victory : " it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . "
again , well said rudi ...
völler and his boys may be contemplating another fierce encounter on wednesday , for what the faroes lack in technical skill , they more than make up for in enthusiasm and passion for the game .
despite being stuck at the bottom of group five with one point after a 2:1 defeat by iceland on saturday , the islanders are likely to rise to the challenge posed by the three time world and european champions .
islands of soccer passion although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , nearly one in every eight islanders is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
as a result , every game against a major soccer force is a championship final and the players take to the field as if the world cup itself was the prize to be won at the end of it .
maybe a bit more fire and commitment like that would n't go amiss for the stoical germans come wednesday night . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scotland-germany match ends in 1-1 draw saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way .

across eastern germany , metalworkers and engineers have laid down their tools , striking for a shorter work week .
can germany afford to give in to union pressure ? thirteen years after reunification , employees at eastern german car , steel and machine tools factories in the former communist states work 38 hours a week - three more than their western counterparts do for the same wage .
for the past week they have been on strike , trying to close that gap . but business leaders say eastern productivity still lags behind and some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist part of germany .

at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments . u.s. and german defense ministers donald rumsfeld and peter struck met in germany during rumsfeld 's first trip to the country since the end of the war in iraq .
at a meeting with the press , rumsfeld indicated that german-american relations were " on their way to a point of normalcy . "
but his subsequent comments , repeating his controversial division between " old europe " and " new europe , " ruffled feathers at a time when many transatlantic issues remain unresolved . the two came together at the tenth anniversary celebration for the george c. marshall center in garmisch-partenkirchen , a security-studies institute funded by both the united states and germany .
both gave speeches and then met briefly to discuss issues at the top of the transatlantic security agenda , including the enlarged participation of german forces in peace-keeping and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan .
rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .
" we agree that it is time to look forward - and not back , " said struck . a transatlantic thaw ? although this represents rumsfeld 's first trip to germany since the start of the war in iraq , it is his second meeting with struck in as many months .
struck traveled to washington in early may to meet with rumsfeld - his trip was the start of an offensive effort -lrb- on the part of both sides -rrb- to overcome the divisions over iraq . struck 's trip to washington was followed by a round of high-level diplomatic meetings and carefully planned photo opportunities , designed to convey the message that both sides were moving on .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell visited germany just a week later and , at the end of the month , president george w. bush approached german chancellor gerhard schröder at the 300th anniversary celebrations in russia and again at the g-8 meeting in evian .
most recently , president bush called chancellor schröder to express his sympathies over the loss of german soldiers in afghanistan . before struck met with rumsfeld in may , he was optimistic about the chances for reconciliation , stating that he had always gotten on well with his u.s.-counterpart and predicting that the matter would be addressed in a matter of minutes .
" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "
one month later , it 's not clear if making-up will be that easy . lingering tensions tensions remain , most recently surfacing during the debate over the international criminal court .
the bush administration has been attempting to secure immunity for u.s. soldiers , fearing that they may become victims of politically-motivated prosecutions .
meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .
this move by the europeans greatly angered washington . what 's more , questions still remain over the validity of claims made by the united states and britain about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
in a recent interview with the magazine vanity fair , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz was quoted as saying that the united states concentrated on the issue of weapons of mass destruction because it was likely to garner the most support , although - from the american standpoint - it was never a primary reason for war . rumsfeld subsequently stated that he had every confidence weapons of mass destruction would be uncovered in iraq .
when struck was asked by the zdf morning news program whether or not he would address the issue during his meeting with rumsfeld today , struck replied that he would n't .
" but it would be interesting to see what the american 's had to say , " he said . rumsfeld is in the midst of a four day trip to europe , including stops in portugal , albania , germany , and brussels .
on thursday , he is scheduled to arrive in brussels , where he will meet with other nato defence ministers to discuss a possible redesign of the north atlantic treaty organization structures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the road to portugal germany beats faroe islands by a hair german soccer team avoids embarrassing draw " mcberti " takes on his former team german players pessimistic ahead of italy clash culture & lifestyle -pipe- 11.06.2003 reticent germans face possible curse of the faroes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : walk the walk but do n't talk the talk : rudi völler -lrb- left -rrb- and michael ballack in training .
everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .
but instead of playing up to the role of favorites , the german camp is towing the regular party line of near silence .
germans giving nothing away as much as the germans like to celebrate their regular successes on the international soccer scene , they are a reticent bunch when the outcome of the competition has yet to be decided .
in typical fashion , the germans refused to build themselves up before the scotland game on saturday , despite being the stronger team on paper , and are typically tight-lipped about their chances against the faroes .
it seems the safest option .
the refusal to blow their own trumpet has every angle covered - win , lose or draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose looks forward to facing the faroe islands .
so far , no one can be pinned down on the way they expect the game to go .
midfielder michael ballack refused to comment on the possible result at a recent press conference and instead directed some diplomatic yet thinly- veiled criticism to stir his team mates ahead of the clash by saying , " some of the players must realize what it means to play for germany and act accordingly . "
meanwhile striker miroslav klose took the easy way out and played dumb when quizzed on germany 's opponents : " all i know is there 's plenty of sheep with mountains in the background . "
proceed with caution ?
although expectation within the sport was high of a crushing german victory over mcberti and his team of brave scots ; as usual none of it seemed to emanate from the german players themselves .
and while there were no words to come back to haunt them after finishing the match with a single point , the apparent caution in their media approach was extended to their display on the pitch .
the germans seemed to balk at the tenacity of scotland and at times looked overawed by the support from the crowd inside the cauldron of noise that was hampden park .
chances are , however , that the germans will overcome the part-timers of the faroes on wednesday to top group five and keep their chances of automatic qualification for the european championships in portugal next summer well and truly alive .
but then again , as the germans seem to acknowledge more than most , nothing can be taken for granted .
that elusive emphatic win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tight-lipped : völler and skibbe the last time the two teams met was in hanover last october .
the germans were once again expected to put the faroes to the sword but stuttered in front of their own supporters and made a 2:1 victory look like a lucky escape .
the effect of failing to hit double figures on the back of a successful world cup campaign in japan / south korea was evident in coach völler 's stunned reaction to the narrow victory : " it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . "
again , well said rudi ...
völler and his boys may be contemplating another fierce encounter on wednesday , for what the faroes lack in technical skill , they more than make up for in enthusiasm and passion for the game .
despite being stuck at the bottom of group five with one point after a 2:1 defeat by iceland on saturday , the islanders are likely to rise to the challenge posed by the three time world and european champions .

everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .
but instead of playing up to the role of favorites , the german camp is towing the regular party line of near silence .
germans giving nothing away as much as the germans like to celebrate their regular successes on the international soccer scene , they are a reticent bunch when the outcome of the competition has yet to be decided .
in typical fashion , the germans refused to build themselves up before the scotland game on saturday , despite being the stronger team on paper , and are typically tight-lipped about their chances against the faroes .
it seems the safest option .
the refusal to blow their own trumpet has every angle covered - win , lose or draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose looks forward to facing the faroe islands .
so far , no one can be pinned down on the way they expect the game to go .
midfielder michael ballack refused to comment on the possible result at a recent press conference and instead directed some diplomatic yet thinly- veiled criticism to stir his team mates ahead of the clash by saying , " some of the players must realize what it means to play for germany and act accordingly . "
meanwhile striker miroslav klose took the easy way out and played dumb when quizzed on germany 's opponents : " all i know is there 's plenty of sheep with mountains in the background . "
proceed with caution ?
although expectation within the sport was high of a crushing german victory over mcberti and his team of brave scots ; as usual none of it seemed to emanate from the german players themselves .
and while there were no words to come back to haunt them after finishing the match with a single point , the apparent caution in their media approach was extended to their display on the pitch .
the germans seemed to balk at the tenacity of scotland and at times looked overawed by the support from the crowd inside the cauldron of noise that was hampden park .
chances are , however , that the germans will overcome the part-timers of the faroes on wednesday to top group five and keep their chances of automatic qualification for the european championships in portugal next summer well and truly alive .

the germans were once again expected to put the faroes to the sword but stuttered in front of their own supporters and made a 2:1 victory look like a lucky escape .
the effect of failing to hit double figures on the back of a successful world cup campaign in japan / south korea was evident in coach völler 's stunned reaction to the narrow victory : " it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .

the germans were once again expected to put the faroes to the sword but stuttered in front of their own supporters and made a 2:1 victory look like a lucky escape .
the effect of failing to hit double figures on the back of a successful world cup campaign in japan / south korea was evident in coach völler 's stunned reaction to the narrow victory : " it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . "
again , well said rudi ...
völler and his boys may be contemplating another fierce encounter on wednesday , for what the faroes lack in technical skill , they more than make up for in enthusiasm and passion for the game .
despite being stuck at the bottom of group five with one point after a 2:1 defeat by iceland on saturday , the islanders are likely to rise to the challenge posed by the three time world and european champions .
islands of soccer passion although neither their league nor their national team plays a big role on the international soccer stage , nearly one in every eight islanders is a member of a soccer club – a statistic larger soccer nations can only dream of .
as a result , every game against a major soccer force is a championship final and the players take to the field as if the world cup itself was the prize to be won at the end of it .
maybe a bit more fire and commitment like that would n't go amiss for the stoical germans come wednesday night . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de scotland-germany match ends in 1-1 draw saturday 's result leaves group five in european cup qualifying still impossible to call , but germany , with eight points from four games , is well on its way .

there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "

the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .

across eastern germany , metalworkers and engineers have laid down their tools , striking for a shorter work week .
can germany afford to give in to union pressure ? thirteen years after reunification , employees at eastern german car , steel and machine tools factories in the former communist states work 38 hours a week - three more than their western counterparts do for the same wage .
for the past week they have been on strike , trying to close that gap . but business leaders say eastern productivity still lags behind and some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist part of germany .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce . instigated by the mighty ig metall trade union when many easterns are looking for work , the strike has caused some to question whether organized labor wields too much power .
recent opinion polls show that increasing numbers of germans agree that their government must scale back its generous social welfare system in order to awake from its economic slumber . but the unions have remained staunchly opposed , determined to defend the welfare state they spent decades helping to erect .
instead , the unions advocate a plan calling for increased public spending in order to stimulate the economy . new attitudes toward unions their resistance to reform has led many germans to turn their back on organized labor .
union membership has dropped to 7.7 million last year , from 11.8 million in 1991 .
and a recent infratest poll showed that 50 percent of germans now say union power should be curbed , versus only 26 percent who think their influence should rise - the exact reverse of four years ago . with the germany economy currently in such a precarious state , the latest strike runs the risk of even further isolating the unions from the public at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " opposition christian democrat party leader angela merkel recently told ard television last month . unions in germany not only exercise their power through demonstrations and work stoppages .
they also can count 80 percent of the social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- federal parliamentarians as members . " in order to placate the unions , the social democratic party sought union-backed candidates during the last elections , to ensure that union people were actively involved in the party , " said political scientist hans-peter müller . the strong union presence in government means it is sometimes hard for german chancellor gerhard schröder to push through his economic reform agenda , and an ever-widening rift has formed between the spd and its once die-hard constituency . as german growth has stalled , schröder ’ s government has begun attempting to push through desperately needed reforms to the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and its inflexible labor market .
while the government is now opposing organized labor , only a few years ago it was toeing the union line . a good example is the issue of job security .
during the last parliament , schröder 's government amended a law making it harder to fire workers in response to union pressure .
because of the dire economic situation , however , the law is once again on the table . worker participation in the early days of the west germany , the unions ' goal was to achieve worker participation in industry .
they quickly became a force to be reckoned with , and step by step they achieved cuts in working hours and broke the employers ' right to dictate wage levels . since the 1950s , unions have grown to hold at least a third of the seats on german companies ' supervisory boards .
in the coal and steel industry , they hold a good half of the seats on every such board . in the current labor dispute rocking eastern germany , one steel company , eko stahl in eisenhütten near the polish border , has already acquiesced to workers ' demands . it granted the 35 hour week in order to get production up and running as quickly as possible . ralf koehler , the representative of ig metall at eko stahl , says the 35 hour week is fair .
" economically , we 've been making a profit for years .
the company is earning millions of euros and we want our just share , " he said . other workers are more in line with the government than their own union , however .
jörg heymann , a maschinist at eko stahl , opposed the strike . " -lrb- keeping -rrb- my job is more important , regardless of the hours , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east .

at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments . u.s. and german defense ministers donald rumsfeld and peter struck met in germany during rumsfeld 's first trip to the country since the end of the war in iraq .
at a meeting with the press , rumsfeld indicated that german-american relations were " on their way to a point of normalcy . "
but his subsequent comments , repeating his controversial division between " old europe " and " new europe , " ruffled feathers at a time when many transatlantic issues remain unresolved . the two came together at the tenth anniversary celebration for the george c. marshall center in garmisch-partenkirchen , a security-studies institute funded by both the united states and germany .
both gave speeches and then met briefly to discuss issues at the top of the transatlantic security agenda , including the enlarged participation of german forces in peace-keeping and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan .
rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .
" we agree that it is time to look forward - and not back , " said struck . a transatlantic thaw ? although this represents rumsfeld 's first trip to germany since the start of the war in iraq , it is his second meeting with struck in as many months .
struck traveled to washington in early may to meet with rumsfeld - his trip was the start of an offensive effort -lrb- on the part of both sides -rrb- to overcome the divisions over iraq . struck 's trip to washington was followed by a round of high-level diplomatic meetings and carefully planned photo opportunities , designed to convey the message that both sides were moving on .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell visited germany just a week later and , at the end of the month , president george w. bush approached german chancellor gerhard schröder at the 300th anniversary celebrations in russia and again at the g-8 meeting in evian .
most recently , president bush called chancellor schröder to express his sympathies over the loss of german soldiers in afghanistan . before struck met with rumsfeld in may , he was optimistic about the chances for reconciliation , stating that he had always gotten on well with his u.s.-counterpart and predicting that the matter would be addressed in a matter of minutes .
" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "
one month later , it 's not clear if making-up will be that easy . lingering tensions tensions remain , most recently surfacing during the debate over the international criminal court .
the bush administration has been attempting to secure immunity for u.s. soldiers , fearing that they may become victims of politically-motivated prosecutions .
meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .
this move by the europeans greatly angered washington . what 's more , questions still remain over the validity of claims made by the united states and britain about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
in a recent interview with the magazine vanity fair , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz was quoted as saying that the united states concentrated on the issue of weapons of mass destruction because it was likely to garner the most support , although - from the american standpoint - it was never a primary reason for war . rumsfeld subsequently stated that he had every confidence weapons of mass destruction would be uncovered in iraq .
when struck was asked by the zdf morning news program whether or not he would address the issue during his meeting with rumsfeld today , struck replied that he would n't .
" but it would be interesting to see what the american 's had to say , " he said . rumsfeld is in the midst of a four day trip to europe , including stops in portugal , albania , germany , and brussels .
on thursday , he is scheduled to arrive in brussels , where he will meet with other nato defence ministers to discuss a possible redesign of the north atlantic treaty organization structures .

" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "
one month later , it 's not clear if making-up will be that easy . lingering tensions tensions remain , most recently surfacing during the debate over the international criminal court .
the bush administration has been attempting to secure immunity for u.s. soldiers , fearing that they may become victims of politically-motivated prosecutions .
meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .
this move by the europeans greatly angered washington . what 's more , questions still remain over the validity of claims made by the united states and britain about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
in a recent interview with the magazine vanity fair , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz was quoted as saying that the united states concentrated on the issue of weapons of mass destruction because it was likely to garner the most support , although - from the american standpoint - it was never a primary reason for war . rumsfeld subsequently stated that he had every confidence weapons of mass destruction would be uncovered in iraq .
when struck was asked by the zdf morning news program whether or not he would address the issue during his meeting with rumsfeld today , struck replied that he would n't .
" but it would be interesting to see what the american 's had to say , " he said . rumsfeld is in the midst of a four day trip to europe , including stops in portugal , albania , germany , and brussels .
on thursday , he is scheduled to arrive in brussels , where he will meet with other nato defence ministers to discuss a possible redesign of the north atlantic treaty organization structures .
a key area of concern : making the organization more adept to face threats such as terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .
european double standard ?
the u.s. effort has encountered stiff resistance from european allies , who believe that the terms set by the united states would undermine the power of the court before it has tried its first case .

britain , france and other european governments have signed such agreements with afghanistan , shielding thousands of european peacekeepers from surrender by afghan authorities to the hague-based court .
the united states accused the 15-member european union of actively lobbying countries , including the 10 future members of the union , not to sign the u.s.-drafted agreements .
the confidential memo warned that recent improvement in relations with france , germany and other countries that opposed the war in iraq could be undone .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .
european double standard ?
the u.s. effort has encountered stiff resistance from european allies , who believe that the terms set by the united states would undermine the power of the court before it has tried its first case .
for their part , the americans accuse the europeans of exercising a double standard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peacekeepers in afghanistan are protected from prosecution by international agreements .
britain , france and other european governments have signed such agreements with afghanistan , shielding thousands of european peacekeepers from surrender by afghan authorities to the hague-based court .
the united states accused the 15-member european union of actively lobbying countries , including the 10 future members of the union , not to sign the u.s.-drafted agreements .
the confidential memo warned that recent improvement in relations with france , germany and other countries that opposed the war in iraq could be undone .
summit in danger " this will undercut all our efforts to repair and rebuild the transatlantic relationship just as we are taking a turn for the better after a number of difficult months , " the confidential memo , known as a démarche , reads .
" we are dismayed that the european union would actively seek to undermine u.s. efforts . "
the dispute may come to a head at a planned summit of european and u.s. leaders in washington on june 25 .
security council vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.n. wants to avoid a split like that over the iraq war .
despite opposition , the resolution to extend the immunity is expected to pass the security council easily on thursday .
the u.n. is extremely wary of entering into yet another fray with the white house , following the debacle over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq earlier this year .
still unclear is whether germany and france will show their opposition to the u.s. stance by abstaining from the vote .
last year 's vote was 15-0 after the united states threatened to veto u.n. peacekeeping missions .
canada seeks debate four key advocates for the court that do not have council seats - canada , switzerland new zealand and jordan – have asked for an open debate on the international criminal court ; this debate may also take place on thursday .
canada 's ambassador to the u.n. , paul heinbecker , said : " we would like to have the opportunity to register our support for the court .
we see it as bringing accountability to the worst tyrants and the perpetrators of crime . "
taking criminals to court as the first permanent global criminal court , the icc was set up to try individuals for the world 's worst atrocities - genocide , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses - in a belated effort to fulfill the promise of the nuremberg trials 57 years ago that prosecuted nazi leaders .
among the court 's chief advocates are european union nations , especially germany , which joined the council this year .
a total of 90 countries have so far ratified the treaty , including all 15 eu member states .
139 countries are signatories to the rome statute of the international criminal court , which established the court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic turbulence reaches new low relations between the united states and europe have hit rock bottom since president george bush took office .

at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments . u.s. and german defense ministers donald rumsfeld and peter struck met in germany during rumsfeld 's first trip to the country since the end of the war in iraq .
at a meeting with the press , rumsfeld indicated that german-american relations were " on their way to a point of normalcy . "
but his subsequent comments , repeating his controversial division between " old europe " and " new europe , " ruffled feathers at a time when many transatlantic issues remain unresolved . the two came together at the tenth anniversary celebration for the george c. marshall center in garmisch-partenkirchen , a security-studies institute funded by both the united states and germany .
both gave speeches and then met briefly to discuss issues at the top of the transatlantic security agenda , including the enlarged participation of german forces in peace-keeping and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan .
rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .
" we agree that it is time to look forward - and not back , " said struck . a transatlantic thaw ? although this represents rumsfeld 's first trip to germany since the start of the war in iraq , it is his second meeting with struck in as many months .
struck traveled to washington in early may to meet with rumsfeld - his trip was the start of an offensive effort -lrb- on the part of both sides -rrb- to overcome the divisions over iraq . struck 's trip to washington was followed by a round of high-level diplomatic meetings and carefully planned photo opportunities , designed to convey the message that both sides were moving on .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell visited germany just a week later and , at the end of the month , president george w. bush approached german chancellor gerhard schröder at the 300th anniversary celebrations in russia and again at the g-8 meeting in evian .
most recently , president bush called chancellor schröder to express his sympathies over the loss of german soldiers in afghanistan . before struck met with rumsfeld in may , he was optimistic about the chances for reconciliation , stating that he had always gotten on well with his u.s.-counterpart and predicting that the matter would be addressed in a matter of minutes .
" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "
one month later , it 's not clear if making-up will be that easy . lingering tensions tensions remain , most recently surfacing during the debate over the international criminal court .
the bush administration has been attempting to secure immunity for u.s. soldiers , fearing that they may become victims of politically-motivated prosecutions .
meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .
this move by the europeans greatly angered washington . what 's more , questions still remain over the validity of claims made by the united states and britain about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
in a recent interview with the magazine vanity fair , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz was quoted as saying that the united states concentrated on the issue of weapons of mass destruction because it was likely to garner the most support , although - from the american standpoint - it was never a primary reason for war . rumsfeld subsequently stated that he had every confidence weapons of mass destruction would be uncovered in iraq .
when struck was asked by the zdf morning news program whether or not he would address the issue during his meeting with rumsfeld today , struck replied that he would n't .
" but it would be interesting to see what the american 's had to say , " he said . rumsfeld is in the midst of a four day trip to europe , including stops in portugal , albania , germany , and brussels .
on thursday , he is scheduled to arrive in brussels , where he will meet with other nato defence ministers to discuss a possible redesign of the north atlantic treaty organization structures .

there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .

there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "

but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 11.06.2003 german unions : good guys or reform blockers ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall union members recently voted to expand their strikes .
across eastern germany , metalworkers and engineers have laid down their tools , striking for a shorter work week .
can germany afford to give in to union pressure ? thirteen years after reunification , employees at eastern german car , steel and machine tools factories in the former communist states work 38 hours a week - three more than their western counterparts do for the same wage .
for the past week they have been on strike , trying to close that gap . but business leaders say eastern productivity still lags behind and some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist part of germany .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce . instigated by the mighty ig metall trade union when many easterns are looking for work , the strike has caused some to question whether organized labor wields too much power .
recent opinion polls show that increasing numbers of germans agree that their government must scale back its generous social welfare system in order to awake from its economic slumber . but the unions have remained staunchly opposed , determined to defend the welfare state they spent decades helping to erect .
instead , the unions advocate a plan calling for increased public spending in order to stimulate the economy . new attitudes toward unions their resistance to reform has led many germans to turn their back on organized labor .
union membership has dropped to 7.7 million last year , from 11.8 million in 1991 .
and a recent infratest poll showed that 50 percent of germans now say union power should be curbed , versus only 26 percent who think their influence should rise - the exact reverse of four years ago . with the germany economy currently in such a precarious state , the latest strike runs the risk of even further isolating the unions from the public at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " opposition christian democrat party leader angela merkel recently told ard television last month . unions in germany not only exercise their power through demonstrations and work stoppages .
they also can count 80 percent of the social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- federal parliamentarians as members . " in order to placate the unions , the social democratic party sought union-backed candidates during the last elections , to ensure that union people were actively involved in the party , " said political scientist hans-peter müller . the strong union presence in government means it is sometimes hard for german chancellor gerhard schröder to push through his economic reform agenda , and an ever-widening rift has formed between the spd and its once die-hard constituency . as german growth has stalled , schröder ’ s government has begun attempting to push through desperately needed reforms to the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and its inflexible labor market .
while the government is now opposing organized labor , only a few years ago it was toeing the union line . a good example is the issue of job security .
during the last parliament , schröder 's government amended a law making it harder to fire workers in response to union pressure .
because of the dire economic situation , however , the law is once again on the table . worker participation in the early days of the west germany , the unions ' goal was to achieve worker participation in industry .
they quickly became a force to be reckoned with , and step by step they achieved cuts in working hours and broke the employers ' right to dictate wage levels . since the 1950s , unions have grown to hold at least a third of the seats on german companies ' supervisory boards .
in the coal and steel industry , they hold a good half of the seats on every such board . in the current labor dispute rocking eastern germany , one steel company , eko stahl in eisenhütten near the polish border , has already acquiesced to workers ' demands . it granted the 35 hour week in order to get production up and running as quickly as possible . ralf koehler , the representative of ig metall at eko stahl , says the 35 hour week is fair .
" economically , we 've been making a profit for years .
the company is earning millions of euros and we want our just share , " he said . other workers are more in line with the government than their own union , however .
jörg heymann , a maschinist at eko stahl , opposed the strike . " -lrb- keeping -rrb- my job is more important , regardless of the hours , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : schröder hopes to mend ties with bush the powell visit germany : no nato in iraq without un u.s. and europe face diplomatic challenges in evian germany 's fischer says u.s. visit " successful " current affairs -pipe- 11.06.2003 rumsfeld repeats " old europe " comments großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. secretary of defense , donald rumsfeld , left , is welcomed by german defense minister peter struck upon his arrival in germany .
at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments . u.s. and german defense ministers donald rumsfeld and peter struck met in germany during rumsfeld 's first trip to the country since the end of the war in iraq .
at a meeting with the press , rumsfeld indicated that german-american relations were " on their way to a point of normalcy . "
but his subsequent comments , repeating his controversial division between " old europe " and " new europe , " ruffled feathers at a time when many transatlantic issues remain unresolved . the two came together at the tenth anniversary celebration for the george c. marshall center in garmisch-partenkirchen , a security-studies institute funded by both the united states and germany .
both gave speeches and then met briefly to discuss issues at the top of the transatlantic security agenda , including the enlarged participation of german forces in peace-keeping and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan .
rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .

rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .
" we agree that it is time to look forward - and not back , " said struck . a transatlantic thaw ? although this represents rumsfeld 's first trip to germany since the start of the war in iraq , it is his second meeting with struck in as many months .
struck traveled to washington in early may to meet with rumsfeld - his trip was the start of an offensive effort -lrb- on the part of both sides -rrb- to overcome the divisions over iraq . struck 's trip to washington was followed by a round of high-level diplomatic meetings and carefully planned photo opportunities , designed to convey the message that both sides were moving on .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell visited germany just a week later and , at the end of the month , president george w. bush approached german chancellor gerhard schröder at the 300th anniversary celebrations in russia and again at the g-8 meeting in evian .
most recently , president bush called chancellor schröder to express his sympathies over the loss of german soldiers in afghanistan . before struck met with rumsfeld in may , he was optimistic about the chances for reconciliation , stating that he had always gotten on well with his u.s.-counterpart and predicting that the matter would be addressed in a matter of minutes .
" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "
one month later , it 's not clear if making-up will be that easy . lingering tensions tensions remain , most recently surfacing during the debate over the international criminal court .
the bush administration has been attempting to secure immunity for u.s. soldiers , fearing that they may become victims of politically-motivated prosecutions .
meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .
this move by the europeans greatly angered washington . what 's more , questions still remain over the validity of claims made by the united states and britain about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
in a recent interview with the magazine vanity fair , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz was quoted as saying that the united states concentrated on the issue of weapons of mass destruction because it was likely to garner the most support , although - from the american standpoint - it was never a primary reason for war . rumsfeld subsequently stated that he had every confidence weapons of mass destruction would be uncovered in iraq .
when struck was asked by the zdf morning news program whether or not he would address the issue during his meeting with rumsfeld today , struck replied that he would n't .
" but it would be interesting to see what the american 's had to say , " he said . rumsfeld is in the midst of a four day trip to europe , including stops in portugal , albania , germany , and brussels .
on thursday , he is scheduled to arrive in brussels , where he will meet with other nato defence ministers to discuss a possible redesign of the north atlantic treaty organization structures .
a key area of concern : making the organization more adept to face threats such as terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .

britain , france and other european governments have signed such agreements with afghanistan , shielding thousands of european peacekeepers from surrender by afghan authorities to the hague-based court .
the united states accused the 15-member european union of actively lobbying countries , including the 10 future members of the union , not to sign the u.s.-drafted agreements .
the confidential memo warned that recent improvement in relations with france , germany and other countries that opposed the war in iraq could be undone .
summit in danger " this will undercut all our efforts to repair and rebuild the transatlantic relationship just as we are taking a turn for the better after a number of difficult months , " the confidential memo , known as a démarche , reads .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .
european double standard ?
the u.s. effort has encountered stiff resistance from european allies , who believe that the terms set by the united states would undermine the power of the court before it has tried its first case .
for their part , the americans accuse the europeans of exercising a double standard .

britain , france and other european governments have signed such agreements with afghanistan , shielding thousands of european peacekeepers from surrender by afghan authorities to the hague-based court .
the united states accused the 15-member european union of actively lobbying countries , including the 10 future members of the union , not to sign the u.s.-drafted agreements .
the confidential memo warned that recent improvement in relations with france , germany and other countries that opposed the war in iraq could be undone .
summit in danger " this will undercut all our efforts to repair and rebuild the transatlantic relationship just as we are taking a turn for the better after a number of difficult months , " the confidential memo , known as a démarche , reads .
" we are dismayed that the european union would actively seek to undermine u.s. efforts . "
the dispute may come to a head at a planned summit of european and u.s. leaders in washington on june 25 .

the u.n. is extremely wary of entering into yet another fray with the white house , following the debacle over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq earlier this year .

we see it as bringing accountability to the worst tyrants and the perpetrators of crime . "
taking criminals to court as the first permanent global criminal court , the icc was set up to try individuals for the world 's worst atrocities - genocide , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses - in a belated effort to fulfill the promise of the nuremberg trials 57 years ago that prosecuted nazi leaders .

everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .
but instead of playing up to the role of favorites , the german camp is towing the regular party line of near silence .
germans giving nothing away as much as the germans like to celebrate their regular successes on the international soccer scene , they are a reticent bunch when the outcome of the competition has yet to be decided .

"
meanwhile striker miroslav klose took the easy way out and played dumb when quizzed on germany 's opponents : " all i know is there 's plenty of sheep with mountains in the background . "
proceed with caution ?
although expectation within the sport was high of a crushing german victory over mcberti and his team of brave scots ; as usual none of it seemed to emanate from the german players themselves .
and while there were no words to come back to haunt them after finishing the match with a single point , the apparent caution in their media approach was extended to their display on the pitch .
the germans seemed to balk at the tenacity of scotland and at times looked overawed by the support from the crowd inside the cauldron of noise that was hampden park .
chances are , however , that the germans will overcome the part-timers of the faroes on wednesday to top group five and keep their chances of automatic qualification for the european championships in portugal next summer well and truly alive .

across eastern germany , metalworkers and engineers have laid down their tools , striking for a shorter work week .
can germany afford to give in to union pressure ? thirteen years after reunification , employees at eastern german car , steel and machine tools factories in the former communist states work 38 hours a week - three more than their western counterparts do for the same wage .
for the past week they have been on strike , trying to close that gap . but business leaders say eastern productivity still lags behind and some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist part of germany .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce . instigated by the mighty ig metall trade union when many easterns are looking for work , the strike has caused some to question whether organized labor wields too much power .
recent opinion polls show that increasing numbers of germans agree that their government must scale back its generous social welfare system in order to awake from its economic slumber . but the unions have remained staunchly opposed , determined to defend the welfare state they spent decades helping to erect .
instead , the unions advocate a plan calling for increased public spending in order to stimulate the economy . new attitudes toward unions their resistance to reform has led many germans to turn their back on organized labor .
union membership has dropped to 7.7 million last year , from 11.8 million in 1991 .
and a recent infratest poll showed that 50 percent of germans now say union power should be curbed , versus only 26 percent who think their influence should rise - the exact reverse of four years ago . with the germany economy currently in such a precarious state , the latest strike runs the risk of even further isolating the unions from the public at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " opposition christian democrat party leader angela merkel recently told ard television last month . unions in germany not only exercise their power through demonstrations and work stoppages .
they also can count 80 percent of the social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- federal parliamentarians as members . " in order to placate the unions , the social democratic party sought union-backed candidates during the last elections , to ensure that union people were actively involved in the party , " said political scientist hans-peter müller . the strong union presence in government means it is sometimes hard for german chancellor gerhard schröder to push through his economic reform agenda , and an ever-widening rift has formed between the spd and its once die-hard constituency . as german growth has stalled , schröder ’ s government has begun attempting to push through desperately needed reforms to the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and its inflexible labor market .
while the government is now opposing organized labor , only a few years ago it was toeing the union line . a good example is the issue of job security .
during the last parliament , schröder 's government amended a law making it harder to fire workers in response to union pressure .
because of the dire economic situation , however , the law is once again on the table . worker participation in the early days of the west germany , the unions ' goal was to achieve worker participation in industry .
they quickly became a force to be reckoned with , and step by step they achieved cuts in working hours and broke the employers ' right to dictate wage levels . since the 1950s , unions have grown to hold at least a third of the seats on german companies ' supervisory boards .
in the coal and steel industry , they hold a good half of the seats on every such board . in the current labor dispute rocking eastern germany , one steel company , eko stahl in eisenhütten near the polish border , has already acquiesced to workers ' demands . it granted the 35 hour week in order to get production up and running as quickly as possible . ralf koehler , the representative of ig metall at eko stahl , says the 35 hour week is fair .
" economically , we 've been making a profit for years .
the company is earning millions of euros and we want our just share , " he said . other workers are more in line with the government than their own union , however .
jörg heymann , a maschinist at eko stahl , opposed the strike . " -lrb- keeping -rrb- my job is more important , regardless of the hours , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eastern german metal workers strike for shorter hours eastern german engineering workers took to the picket lines , striking in an attempt to shorten their workweek to western levels .
some fear the labor unrest could hurt the economy of the former communist east .

everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .
but instead of playing up to the role of favorites , the german camp is towing the regular party line of near silence .
germans giving nothing away as much as the germans like to celebrate their regular successes on the international soccer scene , they are a reticent bunch when the outcome of the competition has yet to be decided .
in typical fashion , the germans refused to build themselves up before the scotland game on saturday , despite being the stronger team on paper , and are typically tight-lipped about their chances against the faroes .
it seems the safest option .
the refusal to blow their own trumpet has every angle covered - win , lose or draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose looks forward to facing the faroe islands .
so far , no one can be pinned down on the way they expect the game to go .
midfielder michael ballack refused to comment on the possible result at a recent press conference and instead directed some diplomatic yet thinly- veiled criticism to stir his team mates ahead of the clash by saying , " some of the players must realize what it means to play for germany and act accordingly . "
meanwhile striker miroslav klose took the easy way out and played dumb when quizzed on germany 's opponents : " all i know is there 's plenty of sheep with mountains in the background . "
proceed with caution ?
although expectation within the sport was high of a crushing german victory over mcberti and his team of brave scots ; as usual none of it seemed to emanate from the german players themselves .
and while there were no words to come back to haunt them after finishing the match with a single point , the apparent caution in their media approach was extended to their display on the pitch .
the germans seemed to balk at the tenacity of scotland and at times looked overawed by the support from the crowd inside the cauldron of noise that was hampden park .
chances are , however , that the germans will overcome the part-timers of the faroes on wednesday to top group five and keep their chances of automatic qualification for the european championships in portugal next summer well and truly alive .
but then again , as the germans seem to acknowledge more than most , nothing can be taken for granted .

the effect of failing to hit double figures on the back of a successful world cup campaign in japan / south korea was evident in coach völler 's stunned reaction to the narrow victory : " it ’ s forced us to return back to the basics of getting through a game .
i don ’ t want to glorify anything .
it was obvious from the beginning , that we couldn ’ t win more than three points . "

völler and his boys may be contemplating another fierce encounter on wednesday , for what the faroes lack in technical skill , they more than make up for in enthusiasm and passion for the game .

there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .
even if the delegates fail to find agreement on the remaining sticky issues , they still plan to submit a blueprint at next friday 's summit .
after that they 'll still have three more weeks to fine tune the language before handing the final draft over to the incoming italian presidency on july 18 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu convention reaches compromise the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit .

at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments . u.s. and german defense ministers donald rumsfeld and peter struck met in germany during rumsfeld 's first trip to the country since the end of the war in iraq .
at a meeting with the press , rumsfeld indicated that german-american relations were " on their way to a point of normalcy . "
but his subsequent comments , repeating his controversial division between " old europe " and " new europe , " ruffled feathers at a time when many transatlantic issues remain unresolved . the two came together at the tenth anniversary celebration for the george c. marshall center in garmisch-partenkirchen , a security-studies institute funded by both the united states and germany .
both gave speeches and then met briefly to discuss issues at the top of the transatlantic security agenda , including the enlarged participation of german forces in peace-keeping and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan .
rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .
" we agree that it is time to look forward - and not back , " said struck . a transatlantic thaw ? although this represents rumsfeld 's first trip to germany since the start of the war in iraq , it is his second meeting with struck in as many months .
struck traveled to washington in early may to meet with rumsfeld - his trip was the start of an offensive effort -lrb- on the part of both sides -rrb- to overcome the divisions over iraq . struck 's trip to washington was followed by a round of high-level diplomatic meetings and carefully planned photo opportunities , designed to convey the message that both sides were moving on .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell visited germany just a week later and , at the end of the month , president george w. bush approached german chancellor gerhard schröder at the 300th anniversary celebrations in russia and again at the g-8 meeting in evian .
most recently , president bush called chancellor schröder to express his sympathies over the loss of german soldiers in afghanistan . before struck met with rumsfeld in may , he was optimistic about the chances for reconciliation , stating that he had always gotten on well with his u.s.-counterpart and predicting that the matter would be addressed in a matter of minutes .
" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "
one month later , it 's not clear if making-up will be that easy . lingering tensions tensions remain , most recently surfacing during the debate over the international criminal court .
the bush administration has been attempting to secure immunity for u.s. soldiers , fearing that they may become victims of politically-motivated prosecutions .
meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .
this move by the europeans greatly angered washington . what 's more , questions still remain over the validity of claims made by the united states and britain about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
in a recent interview with the magazine vanity fair , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz was quoted as saying that the united states concentrated on the issue of weapons of mass destruction because it was likely to garner the most support , although - from the american standpoint - it was never a primary reason for war . rumsfeld subsequently stated that he had every confidence weapons of mass destruction would be uncovered in iraq .
when struck was asked by the zdf morning news program whether or not he would address the issue during his meeting with rumsfeld today , struck replied that he would n't .
" but it would be interesting to see what the american 's had to say , " he said . rumsfeld is in the midst of a four day trip to europe , including stops in portugal , albania , germany , and brussels .
on thursday , he is scheduled to arrive in brussels , where he will meet with other nato defence ministers to discuss a possible redesign of the north atlantic treaty organization structures .

across eastern germany , metalworkers and engineers have laid down their tools , striking for a shorter work week .
can germany afford to give in to union pressure ? thirteen years after reunification , employees at eastern german car , steel and machine tools factories in the former communist states work 38 hours a week - three more than their western counterparts do for the same wage .
for the past week they have been on strike , trying to close that gap . but business leaders say eastern productivity still lags behind and some fear the strike could irreparably damage the fragile economy in the former communist part of germany .
whereas in the western states unemployment is around 8 percent , in the depressed east the jobless make up nearly 18 percent of the total workforce . instigated by the mighty ig metall trade union when many easterns are looking for work , the strike has caused some to question whether organized labor wields too much power .
recent opinion polls show that increasing numbers of germans agree that their government must scale back its generous social welfare system in order to awake from its economic slumber . but the unions have remained staunchly opposed , determined to defend the welfare state they spent decades helping to erect .
instead , the unions advocate a plan calling for increased public spending in order to stimulate the economy . new attitudes toward unions their resistance to reform has led many germans to turn their back on organized labor .
union membership has dropped to 7.7 million last year , from 11.8 million in 1991 .
and a recent infratest poll showed that 50 percent of germans now say union power should be curbed , versus only 26 percent who think their influence should rise - the exact reverse of four years ago . with the germany economy currently in such a precarious state , the latest strike runs the risk of even further isolating the unions from the public at large . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel " what ig metall is doing in the -lrb- eastern -rrb- states is destroying jobs , " opposition christian democrat party leader angela merkel recently told ard television last month . unions in germany not only exercise their power through demonstrations and work stoppages .
they also can count 80 percent of the social democratic party ’ s -lrb- spd -rrb- federal parliamentarians as members . " in order to placate the unions , the social democratic party sought union-backed candidates during the last elections , to ensure that union people were actively involved in the party , " said political scientist hans-peter müller . the strong union presence in government means it is sometimes hard for german chancellor gerhard schröder to push through his economic reform agenda , and an ever-widening rift has formed between the spd and its once die-hard constituency . as german growth has stalled , schröder ’ s government has begun attempting to push through desperately needed reforms to the country ’ s overburdened welfare system and its inflexible labor market .
while the government is now opposing organized labor , only a few years ago it was toeing the union line . a good example is the issue of job security .

there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .
even if the delegates fail to find agreement on the remaining sticky issues , they still plan to submit a blueprint at next friday 's summit .

there are still sticking points to be sure , but delegates and leaders at the european convention in brussels say they will still deliver a draft constitution in greece next week - even if it is n't complete . with explicit support for the current draft constitution from the leaders of france and germany and compromises reached on many niggling details , the convention on the future of europe entered into its final sessions on wednesday .
convention president valery giscard d 'estaing said he expected delegates to approve most of the draft language in time for next friday 's eu summit in thessaloniki , greece .
however , he said he would ask the summit to allow the convention to meet again in the first weeks of july to finalize language for the third part of constitution , which covers prickly issues like taxation and foreign policy .
the constitution , which is divided into a preamble and four parts , is expected to clearly define the role of eu institutions before 10 new countries are added to the elite political union in 2004 .
at a french-german summit in berlin on tuesday , chancellor gerhard schröder and french president jacques chirac both pledged their full support for the current draft .
" france and germany are determined to support this -lrb- draft -rrb- without reservation .
we have a good chance to reach success in thessaloniki , " schröder said .
finding consensus after weeks of frustration and squabbling over an early draft , giscard d 'estaing said late last week he had found a " basis for consensus . "
yet despite support from germany and france , the european commission on wednesday criticized the language in giscard d 'estaing 's latest draft , saying it would centralize power with the european council and european parliament and create a " commission of castrati " or " college of eunichs . "
" this model would make the commission weaker than the parliament and the member states , " a spokesman for commission president romano prodi said wednesday .
the commission has argued that , as the central body representing the common interests of europeans , it should be bestowed with greater competencies .
eu president but last week 's breakthrough deal also seemed to address a number of the commission 's concerns .
the document calls for the creation of a full-time eu president , who would replace the current six-month rotating presidency , and an eu foreign minister .
but in a nod to the smaller eu states , the powers of the president would be mostly limited to preparing summit meetings .
the position of european commission president would also be strengthened , since many smaller countries prefer a stronger role for the commission .
the draft would also create a european commission with 15 voting commissioners and 10 non-voting ones , providing each member state with a voice on the commission .
the system would not go into effect until 2009 and would require rotations in the offices ensuring that each member country would have a voting commissioner for 10 out of 15 years .
the compromise would ensure that the eu accession states would each have a commissioner during the crucial first years of membership .
a place at the table a similar compromise aimed at pleasing smaller states would have a rotating chairmanship of ministerial councils , the committees of member state ministers who hash out regulations in economics , the environment , the interior and other policy areas .
bowing to british pressure , giscard d 'estaing has also produced a draft that preserves the right to national veto in the sensitive areas of taxation and foreign policy .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer said wednesday that one country should n't be able to block the will of the rest of the eu and a type of " super qualified majority " voting would be needed to overrule such a blockade .
god and qualified majorities there are a number of other disputed areas that are expected to fill the agenda this week - including whether the constitution should make any reference to god and how complicated qualified majority voting will be weighted .
under the current draft , beginning in 2009 , decisions would require double-majority voting , meaning a majority of eu member states representing 60 percent of the total population of the union would have to vote in favor of an issue .
but in draft language presented on wednesday , the preamble did include a new reference to religious culture in europe .
" -lrb- the eu -rrb- ... draws inspiration from the cultural , religious and humanist inheritance of europe , " the fresh preamble read .
even if the delegates fail to find agreement on the remaining sticky issues , they still plan to submit a blueprint at next friday 's summit .
after that they 'll still have three more weeks to fine tune the language before handing the final draft over to the incoming italian presidency on july 18 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu convention reaches compromise the debate over how to reform the european union ’ s institutions heated up this week , as officials came up with a compromise to avoid scuttling a draft constitution only two weeks ahead of a key summit .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .

at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments . u.s. and german defense ministers donald rumsfeld and peter struck met in germany during rumsfeld 's first trip to the country since the end of the war in iraq .
at a meeting with the press , rumsfeld indicated that german-american relations were " on their way to a point of normalcy . "
but his subsequent comments , repeating his controversial division between " old europe " and " new europe , " ruffled feathers at a time when many transatlantic issues remain unresolved . the two came together at the tenth anniversary celebration for the george c. marshall center in garmisch-partenkirchen , a security-studies institute funded by both the united states and germany .
both gave speeches and then met briefly to discuss issues at the top of the transatlantic security agenda , including the enlarged participation of german forces in peace-keeping and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan .
rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .
" we agree that it is time to look forward - and not back , " said struck . a transatlantic thaw ? although this represents rumsfeld 's first trip to germany since the start of the war in iraq , it is his second meeting with struck in as many months .
struck traveled to washington in early may to meet with rumsfeld - his trip was the start of an offensive effort -lrb- on the part of both sides -rrb- to overcome the divisions over iraq . struck 's trip to washington was followed by a round of high-level diplomatic meetings and carefully planned photo opportunities , designed to convey the message that both sides were moving on .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell visited germany just a week later and , at the end of the month , president george w. bush approached german chancellor gerhard schröder at the 300th anniversary celebrations in russia and again at the g-8 meeting in evian .
most recently , president bush called chancellor schröder to express his sympathies over the loss of german soldiers in afghanistan . before struck met with rumsfeld in may , he was optimistic about the chances for reconciliation , stating that he had always gotten on well with his u.s.-counterpart and predicting that the matter would be addressed in a matter of minutes .
" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "
one month later , it 's not clear if making-up will be that easy . lingering tensions tensions remain , most recently surfacing during the debate over the international criminal court .
the bush administration has been attempting to secure immunity for u.s. soldiers , fearing that they may become victims of politically-motivated prosecutions .
meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .
this move by the europeans greatly angered washington . what 's more , questions still remain over the validity of claims made by the united states and britain about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
in a recent interview with the magazine vanity fair , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz was quoted as saying that the united states concentrated on the issue of weapons of mass destruction because it was likely to garner the most support , although - from the american standpoint - it was never a primary reason for war . rumsfeld subsequently stated that he had every confidence weapons of mass destruction would be uncovered in iraq .
when struck was asked by the zdf morning news program whether or not he would address the issue during his meeting with rumsfeld today , struck replied that he would n't .
" but it would be interesting to see what the american 's had to say , " he said . rumsfeld is in the midst of a four day trip to europe , including stops in portugal , albania , germany , and brussels .
on thursday , he is scheduled to arrive in brussels , where he will meet with other nato defence ministers to discuss a possible redesign of the north atlantic treaty organization structures .
a key area of concern : making the organization more adept to face threats such as terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

everyone expected the germans to beat scotland on saturday but the resulting draw in the european championship qualifiers adds an ominous feeling to their next match against the tiny faroe islands . there are a number of soccer clichés that could be hauled out , dusted down and served to german team chief rudi völler on the eve of his country 's crucial european championship qualifier against the north sea minnows of the faroe islands .
after germany 's lacklustre 1:1 draw with compatriot berti vogt 's scotland on saturday , völler may be tempted to cushion a possible shocking blow by reminding the world that " there are no easy games at this level . "
and after the match , if the unlikely , although not impossible , happens and germany is defeated on the wind-swept archipelago , then the former world cup player-turned coach may simply face the music with the well-worn statement of the embarrassed manager : " it 's a funny old game . "
but at the moment , he 's saying very little apart from stating the obvious : " two points are missing and we absolutely must beat the faroe islands . "
history and form suggests that völler should be a man producing quotable nuggets of confidence for the assembled press ahead of wednesday 's clash .
germany has won the european championships a total of three times and has been runner-up twice whereas the faroe islands have failed to qualify since the championships began in 1960 .
but instead of playing up to the role of favorites , the german camp is towing the regular party line of near silence .
germans giving nothing away as much as the germans like to celebrate their regular successes on the international soccer scene , they are a reticent bunch when the outcome of the competition has yet to be decided .
in typical fashion , the germans refused to build themselves up before the scotland game on saturday , despite being the stronger team on paper , and are typically tight-lipped about their chances against the faroes .
it seems the safest option .
the refusal to blow their own trumpet has every angle covered - win , lose or draw .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klose looks forward to facing the faroe islands .
so far , no one can be pinned down on the way they expect the game to go .
midfielder michael ballack refused to comment on the possible result at a recent press conference and instead directed some diplomatic yet thinly- veiled criticism to stir his team mates ahead of the clash by saying , " some of the players must realize what it means to play for germany and act accordingly . "
meanwhile striker miroslav klose took the easy way out and played dumb when quizzed on germany 's opponents : " all i know is there 's plenty of sheep with mountains in the background . "
proceed with caution ?
although expectation within the sport was high of a crushing german victory over mcberti and his team of brave scots ; as usual none of it seemed to emanate from the german players themselves .
and while there were no words to come back to haunt them after finishing the match with a single point , the apparent caution in their media approach was extended to their display on the pitch .
the germans seemed to balk at the tenacity of scotland and at times looked overawed by the support from the crowd inside the cauldron of noise that was hampden park .
chances are , however , that the germans will overcome the part-timers of the faroes on wednesday to top group five and keep their chances of automatic qualification for the european championships in portugal next summer well and truly alive .

at a meeting with german defense minister peter struck , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld , traveling to germany for the first time since the end of the iraq war , repeated his controversial " old europe " comments . u.s. and german defense ministers donald rumsfeld and peter struck met in germany during rumsfeld 's first trip to the country since the end of the war in iraq .
at a meeting with the press , rumsfeld indicated that german-american relations were " on their way to a point of normalcy . "
but his subsequent comments , repeating his controversial division between " old europe " and " new europe , " ruffled feathers at a time when many transatlantic issues remain unresolved . the two came together at the tenth anniversary celebration for the george c. marshall center in garmisch-partenkirchen , a security-studies institute funded by both the united states and germany .
both gave speeches and then met briefly to discuss issues at the top of the transatlantic security agenda , including the enlarged participation of german forces in peace-keeping and reconstruction efforts in afghanistan .
rumsfeld thanked germans for their assistance in afghanistan . old vs. new europe but niceties aside , the u.s. defence minister had harsh - if indirect - criticism for his french and german european partners .
rumsfeld repeated his " old europe " comments , expanding on the meaning of the division .
he stated that the difference between " old europe " and " new europe " was n't a question of the age , size , or geographic location , but had much more to do with the " behavior and vision " that a nation brings to the transatlantic relationship . struck , however , struck a more conciliatory tone , urging the two sides to put differences behind them and move on .
he stressed that irritations over a particular point would not imperil the long standing relationship .
" we agree that it is time to look forward - and not back , " said struck . a transatlantic thaw ? although this represents rumsfeld 's first trip to germany since the start of the war in iraq , it is his second meeting with struck in as many months .
struck traveled to washington in early may to meet with rumsfeld - his trip was the start of an offensive effort -lrb- on the part of both sides -rrb- to overcome the divisions over iraq . struck 's trip to washington was followed by a round of high-level diplomatic meetings and carefully planned photo opportunities , designed to convey the message that both sides were moving on .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell visited germany just a week later and , at the end of the month , president george w. bush approached german chancellor gerhard schröder at the 300th anniversary celebrations in russia and again at the g-8 meeting in evian .
most recently , president bush called chancellor schröder to express his sympathies over the loss of german soldiers in afghanistan . before struck met with rumsfeld in may , he was optimistic about the chances for reconciliation , stating that he had always gotten on well with his u.s.-counterpart and predicting that the matter would be addressed in a matter of minutes .
" i think we can take care of this in five minutes , " he said .
" we 'll simply say that we had an argument over iraq , and now let 's forget the argument and return to normalcy . "
one month later , it 's not clear if making-up will be that easy . lingering tensions tensions remain , most recently surfacing during the debate over the international criminal court .
the bush administration has been attempting to secure immunity for u.s. soldiers , fearing that they may become victims of politically-motivated prosecutions .
meanwhile , the eu has tried to prevent other european countries from signing bi-lateral agreements with the united states supporting such action .
this move by the europeans greatly angered washington . what 's more , questions still remain over the validity of claims made by the united states and britain about saddam hussein 's weapons of mass destruction .
in a recent interview with the magazine vanity fair , u.s. deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz was quoted as saying that the united states concentrated on the issue of weapons of mass destruction because it was likely to garner the most support , although - from the american standpoint - it was never a primary reason for war . rumsfeld subsequently stated that he had every confidence weapons of mass destruction would be uncovered in iraq .
when struck was asked by the zdf morning news program whether or not he would address the issue during his meeting with rumsfeld today , struck replied that he would n't .
" but it would be interesting to see what the american 's had to say , " he said . rumsfeld is in the midst of a four day trip to europe , including stops in portugal , albania , germany , and brussels .
on thursday , he is scheduled to arrive in brussels , where he will meet with other nato defence ministers to discuss a possible redesign of the north atlantic treaty organization structures .

the u.n. security council is expected to vote on a resolution thursday exempting u.s. peacekeepers from being prosecuted by the new international criminal court . in a dispute that looks set to worsen already strained u.s.-european relations , the bush administration charged the european union on monday with actively undermining its efforts to shield americans from prosecution by the international criminal court , or icc , according to a recent washington post report .
in an unusually tough , confidential diplomatic letter sent to eu governments last week and uncovered by the washington post , the united states accuses a number of eu ambassadors of " lobbying against u.s. bilateral efforts " outside of the extended european community .
the memo warned that the impact on transatlantic relations will be " very damaging " if the eu does not stop .
u.s. tries to buy time on monday , the united states suggested a one-year extension of a resolution adopted last year , which gives prosecution immunity to u.n. peacekeeping personnel from countries that have not ratified the statutes of the icc .
the united states has not ratified the treaty , fearing that its soldiers could be the target of politically motivated prosecutions .
the bush administration said it needed to extend the request for immunity for another year in order to gain time for negotiating more bilateral agreements barring individual governments from surrendering american citizens to the icc .
after a year of trying to negotiate accords with governments around the globe , the united states has so far signed agreements with 37 countries – primarily poor , small ones in africa , asia , latin america and eastern europe .
european double standard ?
the u.s. effort has encountered stiff resistance from european allies , who believe that the terms set by the united states would undermine the power of the court before it has tried its first case .
for their part , the americans accuse the europeans of exercising a double standard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peacekeepers in afghanistan are protected from prosecution by international agreements .
britain , france and other european governments have signed such agreements with afghanistan , shielding thousands of european peacekeepers from surrender by afghan authorities to the hague-based court .
the united states accused the 15-member european union of actively lobbying countries , including the 10 future members of the union , not to sign the u.s.-drafted agreements .
the confidential memo warned that recent improvement in relations with france , germany and other countries that opposed the war in iraq could be undone .
summit in danger " this will undercut all our efforts to repair and rebuild the transatlantic relationship just as we are taking a turn for the better after a number of difficult months , " the confidential memo , known as a démarche , reads .
" we are dismayed that the european union would actively seek to undermine u.s. efforts . "
the dispute may come to a head at a planned summit of european and u.s. leaders in washington on june 25 .
security council vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the u.n. wants to avoid a split like that over the iraq war .
despite opposition , the resolution to extend the immunity is expected to pass the security council easily on thursday .
the u.n. is extremely wary of entering into yet another fray with the white house , following the debacle over the u.s.-led invasion of iraq earlier this year .
still unclear is whether germany and france will show their opposition to the u.s. stance by abstaining from the vote .
last year 's vote was 15-0 after the united states threatened to veto u.n. peacekeeping missions .
canada seeks debate four key advocates for the court that do not have council seats - canada , switzerland new zealand and jordan – have asked for an open debate on the international criminal court ; this debate may also take place on thursday .
canada 's ambassador to the u.n. , paul heinbecker , said : " we would like to have the opportunity to register our support for the court .
we see it as bringing accountability to the worst tyrants and the perpetrators of crime . "
taking criminals to court as the first permanent global criminal court , the icc was set up to try individuals for the world 's worst atrocities - genocide , war crimes and systematic human rights abuses - in a belated effort to fulfill the promise of the nuremberg trials 57 years ago that prosecuted nazi leaders .
among the court 's chief advocates are european union nations , especially germany , which joined the council this year .
a total of 90 countries have so far ratified the treaty , including all 15 eu member states .
139 countries are signatories to the rome statute of the international criminal court , which established the court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de transatlantic turbulence reaches new low relations between the united states and europe have hit rock bottom since president george bush took office .

the study by experts at glasgow university said £ 171m was being spent on the treatment of obesity and related illnesses each year .
the research into the cost burden of the disease also found that the bill for treating obese patients in scotland is considerably higher than in england .
about 21 % of adult scots - more than 850,000 people - are now classified as obese and have a higher risk of suffering from heart disease , diabetes , disability and some cancers .

" it is only when the cost of treating and caring for these diseases is examined , that the real cost of obesity to the scottish nhs becomes clear .
" overall the strongest conclusion is that obesity is a disease with important cost consequences that are comparable to recognised threats to health such as smoking . "

the ruling upholds a lower court decision and challenges the canadian government to change its laws on same-sex marriage .
the appeals court ordered that gay couples seeking a legal union should be issued a marriage licence immediately .
the case had been fought by a gay couple , michael stark and michael leshner , who wasted no time in getting married hours after the ruling .
i 'm very clearly opposed to redefining marriage liberal mp pat o 'brien another couple , jeff parker and david wood , saw the ruling on the internet and immediately went to toronto city hall to get their papers ready for an august wedding .
the 61-page ruling says the heterosexual definition of marriage violates gay couples ' rights under the country 's constitutional document , the charter of rights and freedoms .
ontario is the third canadian province to strike down the federal heterosexual definition of marriage in court decisions .
public opinion the canadian government had asked for more time to study the issue .
now it may not have any left .
all three liberal party leadership candidates to replace outgoing prime minister jean chretien said they would not contest the ruling .
" one thing is very clear that the government can not discriminate when it 's an issue of rights and that 's what the courts are in the process of deciding , " said one of the candidates , paul martin , who is widely seen as the favourite to become the next prime minister .
however some government and opposition members of parliament said they were dismayed by the decision and planned to challenge it at federal level .
" i 'm very clearly publicly already opposed to redefining marriage .
there 's no way i could possibly support that in good conscience and will not support that , " said liberal federal mp pat o 'brien .
polls indicate a slight majority of canadians favour legalisation of same-sex marriages .
some anglican churches in canada have already offered blessings to gay and lesbian couples .

oliver , famed for his " pukka " catchphrase and cheeky cockney persona , has been the tv face of sainsbury 's for the past three years .
he is set to appear in a fresh series of adverts over the next 12 months .
he will also work on product launches and continue to develop recipe cards for customers , sainsbury 's said .
the retailer claims oliver has had a direct impact on its sales , helping it to maintain its slender grip on second spot in the uk supermarket stakes , behind tesco .
when oliver recommended spreading truffle butter under the skin of christmas turkeys last year , the company said , more than 50,000 jars of the product were sold .
profit boost some advertising industry sources have even claimed oliver 's association with sainsbury 's has brought the company an extra £ 1bn of sales - or more than £ 200m in gross profit .
but many retail analysts are sceptical about oliver 's impact on sainsbury 's flagging performance .
earlier this year , the company unveiled annual profits of £ 667m .
but its disappointing 2.3 % increase in sales , in stores open more than a year , left investors shaking their heads .
by comparison , tesco 's annual profits were up 13 % to £ 1.3bn , with a 4.1 % in sales from existing stores .
sainsbury has focused on food rather than new areas like clothing some analysts say sainsbury 's has already lost its second place to us-backed asda .
richard ratner , retail analyst at seymour pierce , said no amount of jamie oliver 's mockney charm could disguise the underlying malaise .
" it is possible to see the effect of jamie oliver 's endorsements on individual lines , but the overall effect is impossible to calculate .
" it certainly has n't had a major effect .
their like-for-like sales -lrb- discounting the effect of new store openings -rrb- are not where they would like them to be . "
tv chefs are highly prized by marketers for their ability to shift individual products .
but the impact of their endorsement is much harder to quantify across an entire retail chain .
" i suppose it could be argued that if it was n't for jamie oliver , they would be doing even worse .
" but there is n't a jamie oliver line as such , so it is difficult to tell .
" perhaps they should stop the jamie oliver ads and see what effect that has on sales , " mr ratner told bbc news online .
growth areas dominic allport , at mintel , said sainsbury 's were " still struggling quite badly . "
one major problem , he said , was that they are losing ground in non-food retailing .
high profit margin items such as clothes and electrical goods are a major growth area for supermarkets .
but sainsbury 's were struggling to keep up with tesco , and oliver 's ads , which have so far concentrated on food , are unlikely to be much help .
he said they also had few town centre stores , which would allow them to sell " value-added products to more affluent customers . "
they also needed to move away from their strongholds in the south , open more stores in the north , where they have about 7 % of the market .
but " trying to keep pace with the juggernaut that is tesco " was a tough job for all uk retailers , he added .
there were signs that sainsbury 's is starting to win the battle .
but the turnaround has not been as quick as that achieved by another iconic british retailer , marks and spencer , which has concentrated on new product lines and store revamps .
good publicity sainsbury 's was trying out innovative ideas - such as joint ventures with the likes of boots and early learning centre - but the results were so far inconclusive , he added .
jamie oliver has undoubtedly generated a lot of publicity for sainsbury , mr allport argued .
his recent channel 4 series , in which he gave a group of underprivileged teenagers a chance to train as chefs had been particularly successful , helping to fend off growing cynicism about his " pukka " lifestyle .
but there was still a danger of over-exposure , mr allport argued .
" they have got to tread carefully with jamie oliver .
there is a fatigue effect if he is seen too much .
" another year is perhaps sufficient . "

earlier this year , the company unveiled annual profits of £ 667m .

tv chefs are highly prized by marketers for their ability to shift individual products .
but the impact of their endorsement is much harder to quantify across an entire retail chain .
" i suppose it could be argued that if it was n't for jamie oliver , they would be doing even worse .

" perhaps they should stop the jamie oliver ads and see what effect that has on sales , " mr ratner told bbc news online .

one major problem , he said , was that they are losing ground in non-food retailing .
high profit margin items such as clothes and electrical goods are a major growth area for supermarkets .
but sainsbury 's were struggling to keep up with tesco , and oliver 's ads , which have so far concentrated on food , are unlikely to be much help .
he said they also had few town centre stores , which would allow them to sell " value-added products to more affluent customers . "
they also needed to move away from their strongholds in the south , open more stores in the north , where they have about 7 % of the market .

the bill has proved highly controversial , since it does not encompass gambling on lotteries or horse racing , which are increasingly valuable sources of tax revenue in many states .
the bill is expected to be made more stringent - with the inclusion of criminal penalties - once it comes before the senate .
the senate banking and finance committee has held hearings on online gaming , but has not yet scheduled a vote on this bill .
online worries the bill is the fruit of lengthy congressional discussions over online gaming .
most forms of online gambling are technically illegal in the us , but the law can do little to touch offshore operations .
these casinos , which number more than 1,500 , have combined us revenues of more than $ 2bn .
legislators have been wary of rewriting gambling law , which is notoriously complex , operating at federal , state , and in some places tribal level .
the current bill seeks instead to clamp down on credit-card payments and other cash transfers , something that can be done with the cooperation of financial services companies .
playing politics the bill is also seen as a shot in the arm for state-approved forms of gambling .
this could even allow online sports bookmakers to extend their operations into states such as utah , where all gambling is currently banned .
at the same time , this has caused controversy in congress , and an amendment to remove such preferences was narrowly defeated .
the bill 's supporters have had to tread a careful line to keep it on track , and have come close to withdrawing it owing to lack of potential support .
in the end , the bill 's lack of criminal sanctions allowed it bypass certain possible opponents .

the force 's annual report , which will be published on wednesday , shows that almost two thirds of crimes have been solved by the force .
however , chief constable andrew cameron will voice concern at continuing levels of youth disorder .
in his report , mr cameron says tackling violent crime has been a major focus of the past year .
the overall figure is down by 14 % , although the number of attempted murders went up by 13 % to eight .
targeted patrols have led to record seizures of offensive weapons .
however , the report says that youths were responsible for a " disproportionately high " number of these cases .
i would urge parents to talk to their children ... to emphasise the serious dangers of weapons being carried in the streets chief constable andrew cameron the force also dealt with more than 3,500 people involved in anti-social behaviour - a large number of whom were young people .
mr cameron said this was a problem that the police could not solve in isolation .
he said responsible parenting , employment , leisure opportunities and a pro-active criminal justice system also had a part to play in solving the problem .
in his report , he says : " i would urge parents to talk to their children before they go out for the evening and when they return home to emphasise the serious dangers of weapons being carried in the streets . "
overall , crime has risen by 7 % .
mr cameron said that was partly explained by more pro-active policing , especially in relation to drug dealing .
hotspots of disorder drugs with an estimated value of more than £ 1.1m were seized last year and more than 200 alleged dealers were arrested .
the force is placing an emphasis on providing reassurance to communities by policing hotspots of disorder .
mr cameron said he was pleased to report that the force had recorded a detection rate of 64 % for the second successive year .
" in my view this is an exceptional performance , given that the scottish average is 45 % , " he writes in the report .
" it is against a background of increased demands and limited resources .
i commend my staff for this outstanding achievement . "
