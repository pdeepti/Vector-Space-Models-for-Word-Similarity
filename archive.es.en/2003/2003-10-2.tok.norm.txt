german farmer , 32 .
well-built , good-looking , outdoors type seeks hard-working woman with marriage in mind .
must like early mornings , long days in the country , inclement weather and the smell of animal waste products . for those who live the life , it is an honorable one , providing sustenance and nutrition for the nation and for those beyond the country ’ s borders .
but the life of the farmer is far from an easy one .
the hard work , the many hours dedicated to the land , the endless concern over crops and herds and the economic situation that barely makes it financially worthwhile at times all add up to making the farmer ’ s existence one few outside the community would choose .
but german farmers are facing up to a more personal problem - finding a partner and hanging onto her . considering all the factors above , it may be understandable why life as the spouse of a farmer who wakes before the sun rises and drops into bed way after it sets - and expects you to do the same - does not appeal to many of those out there looking for a relationship .
a man -lrb- or woman -rrb- who puts the welfare of his pigs before candlelight meals and scatters hay and mud on the marital bed instead of rose petals may not be everyone ’ s vision of the perfect partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alone but never truly alone .
unfortunately , it is these kinds of entrenched stereotypes that are contributing to the lack of interest many farmers across germany are experiencing .
despite technological advances in farming and a drift to more management style farm operations , farmers are still seen as unkempt , mono-syllabic workaholics who always smell of manure , even though many now spend as much time behind a desk as they do in the yard or fields . 400,000 german farmers without partners as if to compound the image that is dogging his fellow farmers , florian reichelt wades through pungent slurry in an outfit that does nothing to promote his attributes as ideal husband material as he laments the lack of love in his life .
at 32 , reichelt should be considered a catch by anyone ’ s standards , a possible posterboy for the farming fraternity .
a large , muscular man with handsome features and good manners , reichelt explained his dilemma , and that of the 400,000 other german farmers who remain unattached , to deutsche welle . “ when girls or women hear you ’ re a farmer , they wrinkle their noses thinking they can smell the cow shed , ” he sighed .
“ others say ‘ no farmers , no rolling in the dirt , no getting up early in the morning ’ . ” no costa del sol come summer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fields as far as the eye can see .
reichelt ’ s longest relationship lasted seven years , but the pressure of his work and the time he dedicated to it caused divisions .
the problems began when , at the height of the harvest , his girlfriend wanted to take three weeks vacation .
farmers ’ partners must face the facts , he said .
summer may mean a holiday for the rest of the world but for it ’ s a farmer 's busiest time . eventually , something had to give .
“ my girlfriend said ‘ it ’ s me or your job ’ and then i said , ‘ yeah , then it ’ s my job ’ . ” although maintaining relationships is a problem for farmers due to the workload and worries surrounding the running of the farm , an even bigger problem is finding a partner in the first place .
many start their careers through inheritance , taking over the family business once their parents enter retirement or in the event of bereavement . the burden of the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's you and me , babe .
often they are handed the huge responsibility at a young age .
while their peers are out at nightclubs , flirting and hooking up , young farmers are striking up meaningful relationships with their prize bulls or wrapping their arms around bails of wheat rather than a pretty girl . the farming community does try and help itself by organizing dances and events , but , as reichelt complained , few ideal partners can be found at such social gatherings .
in an attempt to find true love , reichelt is contemplating joining a specialist dating service for lonely farmers . dating online to the rescue luckily , help is at hand thanks to www.landflirt.de , a farming computer dating agency whose existence goes some way to underline the seriousness of the problem facing the loveless land workers . the idea of a specialized service that offers the hope of love and marriage for german farmers is far from new .
german settlers who came to the united states in the 1800s had their own publication and a network of ‘ bride searchers ’ scouring the promised land for the daughters of pioneers who were looking for a man with land and food to go on the table . nowadays , the needs of the lonely farmer are slightly more complex .
but that hasn ’ t stopped the landflirt site from attracting a steady number of classifieds .
at any one time , there are over 500 male farmers looking for partners on the site and over 200 females .
reichelt ’ s dream woman may be one of them : “ she can have her own job and career but she must be right behind the farm , ” he said .
“ and she must have an interest and confidence in the future of farming . ” he added that a woman looking to have a family life with children could do worse than get hitched to a farmer .
“ we ’ re normally at home in the middle of the day , and in the mornings , it offers good conditions for raising a family . ” economy does little to help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have given farmers a bad press .
however , the negatives unfortunately continue to outweigh the positives .
thanks to adverse media coverage of the current financial situation of german farmers , who have been protesting against the conditions that forced 17,000 farms to close last year , the current perception of them is one of a bunch of whining , unattractive men . sadly , it seems the odds are stacked against those german farmers who are unlucky in love . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de farmers plead for drought relief with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms .

nothing says ' i love you ' like a bunch of carrots .
german farmer , 32 .
well-built , good-looking , outdoors type seeks hard-working woman with marriage in mind .
must like early mornings , long days in the country , inclement weather and the smell of animal waste products . for those who live the life , it is an honorable one , providing sustenance and nutrition for the nation and for those beyond the country ’ s borders .
but the life of the farmer is far from an easy one .
the hard work , the many hours dedicated to the land , the endless concern over crops and herds and the economic situation that barely makes it financially worthwhile at times all add up to making the farmer ’ s existence one few outside the community would choose .
but german farmers are facing up to a more personal problem - finding a partner and hanging onto her . considering all the factors above , it may be understandable why life as the spouse of a farmer who wakes before the sun rises and drops into bed way after it sets - and expects you to do the same - does not appeal to many of those out there looking for a relationship .
a man -lrb- or woman -rrb- who puts the welfare of his pigs before candlelight meals and scatters hay and mud on the marital bed instead of rose petals may not be everyone ’ s vision of the perfect partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alone but never truly alone .
unfortunately , it is these kinds of entrenched stereotypes that are contributing to the lack of interest many farmers across germany are experiencing .
despite technological advances in farming and a drift to more management style farm operations , farmers are still seen as unkempt , mono-syllabic workaholics who always smell of manure , even though many now spend as much time behind a desk as they do in the yard or fields . 400,000 german farmers without partners as if to compound the image that is dogging his fellow farmers , florian reichelt wades through pungent slurry in an outfit that does nothing to promote his attributes as ideal husband material as he laments the lack of love in his life .
at 32 , reichelt should be considered a catch by anyone ’ s standards , a possible posterboy for the farming fraternity .
a large , muscular man with handsome features and good manners , reichelt explained his dilemma , and that of the 400,000 other german farmers who remain unattached , to deutsche welle . “ when girls or women hear you ’ re a farmer , they wrinkle their noses thinking they can smell the cow shed , ” he sighed .
“ others say ‘ no farmers , no rolling in the dirt , no getting up early in the morning ’ . ” no costa del sol come summer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fields as far as the eye can see .
reichelt ’ s longest relationship lasted seven years , but the pressure of his work and the time he dedicated to it caused divisions .
the problems began when , at the height of the harvest , his girlfriend wanted to take three weeks vacation .
farmers ’ partners must face the facts , he said .
summer may mean a holiday for the rest of the world but for it ’ s a farmer 's busiest time . eventually , something had to give .
“ my girlfriend said ‘ it ’ s me or your job ’ and then i said , ‘ yeah , then it ’ s my job ’ . ” although maintaining relationships is a problem for farmers due to the workload and worries surrounding the running of the farm , an even bigger problem is finding a partner in the first place .
many start their careers through inheritance , taking over the family business once their parents enter retirement or in the event of bereavement . the burden of the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's you and me , babe .
often they are handed the huge responsibility at a young age .
while their peers are out at nightclubs , flirting and hooking up , young farmers are striking up meaningful relationships with their prize bulls or wrapping their arms around bails of wheat rather than a pretty girl . the farming community does try and help itself by organizing dances and events , but , as reichelt complained , few ideal partners can be found at such social gatherings .
in an attempt to find true love , reichelt is contemplating joining a specialist dating service for lonely farmers . dating online to the rescue luckily , help is at hand thanks to www.landflirt.de , a farming computer dating agency whose existence goes some way to underline the seriousness of the problem facing the loveless land workers . the idea of a specialized service that offers the hope of love and marriage for german farmers is far from new .
german settlers who came to the united states in the 1800s had their own publication and a network of ‘ bride searchers ’ scouring the promised land for the daughters of pioneers who were looking for a man with land and food to go on the table . nowadays , the needs of the lonely farmer are slightly more complex .
but that hasn ’ t stopped the landflirt site from attracting a steady number of classifieds .
at any one time , there are over 500 male farmers looking for partners on the site and over 200 females .
reichelt ’ s dream woman may be one of them : “ she can have her own job and career but she must be right behind the farm , ” he said .
“ and she must have an interest and confidence in the future of farming . ” he added that a woman looking to have a family life with children could do worse than get hitched to a farmer .
“ we ’ re normally at home in the middle of the day , and in the mornings , it offers good conditions for raising a family . ” economy does little to help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have given farmers a bad press .
however , the negatives unfortunately continue to outweigh the positives .

spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "
gearing up for rome on saturday , heads of state and government leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states as well as the 10 accession states will come together in rome to finalize the text of europe ’ s first constitution .
germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .
but spain , austria and a number of smaller eu countries are demanding changes - with most complaints dealing with the weighing of votes .
making up thursday ’ s meeting marked the first time schröder and aznar have met since they fell out over the iraq war .
after britain , spain has been one of the most outspoken supporters of washington ’ s efforts to topple the regime of saddam hussein .
though politicians in madrid publicly denied it , the spanish government was said to be privately angered that aznar was not invited to a summit two weeks ago in berlin between schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair .
in berlin on thursday , aznar showed no signs of resentment over that meeting . instead , he seemed intent on finding common ground between spain and germany . aznar and schröder agreed to a common position on iraq , saying that it was time to " look forward . "
aznar said both countries wanted to carry out their share in ensuring that sovereignty is returned as quickly as possible to iraqis .
schröder , meanwhile , said ensuring stability in iraq was a shared responsibility .
additionally , the leaders agreed that europe needed to expand it ’ s military capabilities and that europe should establish a central military command that would plan and direct military missions independently of nato .
but the leaders said the command should not be seen as a competitor to nato , but rather a body that could pick up the slack in defense areas where nato couldn ’ t .
schröder and aznar also stressed the importance of building up europe ’ s capacity within nato . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape after 16 months of debate , the drafters of europe 's first constitution completed their work in july .
eu leaders are hoping to ratify the constitution by this december in rome , the site where the treaty founding the european community was signed in 1958 .
berlin summit scores high for attempt at compromise despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise .

spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "
gearing up for rome on saturday , heads of state and government leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states as well as the 10 accession states will come together in rome to finalize the text of europe ’ s first constitution .
germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .
but spain , austria and a number of smaller eu countries are demanding changes - with most complaints dealing with the weighing of votes .
making up thursday ’ s meeting marked the first time schröder and aznar have met since they fell out over the iraq war .
after britain , spain has been one of the most outspoken supporters of washington ’ s efforts to topple the regime of saddam hussein .
though politicians in madrid publicly denied it , the spanish government was said to be privately angered that aznar was not invited to a summit two weeks ago in berlin between schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair .
in berlin on thursday , aznar showed no signs of resentment over that meeting . instead , he seemed intent on finding common ground between spain and germany . aznar and schröder agreed to a common position on iraq , saying that it was time to " look forward . "
aznar said both countries wanted to carry out their share in ensuring that sovereignty is returned as quickly as possible to iraqis .
schröder , meanwhile , said ensuring stability in iraq was a shared responsibility .
additionally , the leaders agreed that europe needed to expand it ’ s military capabilities and that europe should establish a central military command that would plan and direct military missions independently of nato .
but the leaders said the command should not be seen as a competitor to nato , but rather a body that could pick up the slack in defense areas where nato couldn ’ t .
schröder and aznar also stressed the importance of building up europe ’ s capacity within nato . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape after 16 months of debate , the drafters of europe 's first constitution completed their work in july .

spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "
gearing up for rome on saturday , heads of state and government leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states as well as the 10 accession states will come together in rome to finalize the text of europe ’ s first constitution .
germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .

in time , this data could appear in the form of fingerprints and electronic facial signatures on passports and visas , and provide further identification information via retinal eye scans at airports and borders . the passport proposal , agreed by the commission last week , has now been passed to the european council and european parliament where further discussions and decisions will be made on whether to make it compulsory for all member states to store fingerprint data and digital facial images of nationals and immigrants who apply for visas or residence permits . plan targets 2005 for new passport if brussels does decide in favor of the proposals , it 's possible that the traditional european passports could be replaced by a new biometric version as early as 2005 .
under the current plan , eu governments will be responsible for adopting the new standards .
the eu itself does not have any powers to issue passports or other identity papers for individual member states . biometrics is a method of measuring biological dimensions : fingerprints , iris scans , hand measurement , gait recognition , typing rhythms , and many more facets of personal identification that can be encoded and stored on computer chips . photos and biometric chips for visas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu citizens will require biometric visas by 2005 .
as well as eu passports , entry visas for non-eu citizens will also carry photographs by 2005 and will eventually have to be upgraded to include chips that will include biometric information .
according to a european commission statement , the measures were being proposed as part of the increasing need to guarantee a very high level of security .
" existing security standards are improved even further by the integration of two biometric identifiers , " the statement said , " to combat not only document fraud , but also fraudulent use . " the eu is also planning to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu starting next year , as a means to counter illegal immigration . preparations for the introduction of fingerprinting as a primary means of biometric identification began back in june during the european council meeting in thessaloniki .
the attending members agreed to bolster border security and issue new eu passports with improved identity measures to counter the growing trade in fake identity papers by the end of 2004 . it is thought that the decision to add facial imaging to the proposal was influenced by a similar move by the u.s. government and continuing pressure from washington to upgrade european security . u.s. plans delayed for one year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x marks the spot .

the german ministry of the interior has confirmed that it has tested several models for identification .

the german interior minister otto schily again voiced his support of the measures at the time of the european commission adoption of the proposal : “ when we have a problem identifying a person or where that person comes from , biometric recognition will make a clear identification possible . ” but the plans have consistently come under attack by human rights groups which have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .

in time , this data could appear in the form of fingerprints and electronic facial signatures on passports and visas , and provide further identification information via retinal eye scans at airports and borders . the passport proposal , agreed by the commission last week , has now been passed to the european council and european parliament where further discussions and decisions will be made on whether to make it compulsory for all member states to store fingerprint data and digital facial images of nationals and immigrants who apply for visas or residence permits . plan targets 2005 for new passport if brussels does decide in favor of the proposals , it 's possible that the traditional european passports could be replaced by a new biometric version as early as 2005 .
under the current plan , eu governments will be responsible for adopting the new standards .

the attending members agreed to bolster border security and issue new eu passports with improved identity measures to counter the growing trade in fake identity papers by the end of 2004 . it is thought that the decision to add facial imaging to the proposal was influenced by a similar move by the u.s. government and continuing pressure from washington to upgrade european security . u.s. plans delayed for one year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x marks the spot .

experts in the field of biometrics have also questioned the efficiency of the technology currently available in the fight against international security breaches . problems with individual indentification markus kuhn , a lecturer in computer security at the university of cambridge computer lab , told bbc online that biometrics were “ better at verifying identities than humans were when asked to match unfamiliar faces with small photographs in passports and other identity documents . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would biometrics have helped stop 9/11 ?
but he added that their usefulness broke down when used to pick out wanted individuals , such as suspected terrorists , from the mass of people passing through a checkpoint . database size could be problematic there are also concerns about whether the technology could be reliably used on a large scale .
a report issued by the u.s. general accounting office -lrb- gao -rrb- in november 2002 said that the largest iris scanning system currently in use had only 30,000 records . by contrast any system used to verify the identities of people travelling to and from the united states , for example , would have to contain up to 240 million records .
the gao warned that it was " unknown " how a system with many millions of records would perform . it also noted that any biometric system would do little to stem the numbers of illegal immigrants wherever the system was employed because most of them did not enter through recognised ports , and avoided all identity checks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe fingerprints against fraud europe ’ s new system for stemming asylum fraud - an eu-wide fingerprint database - has raised the hackles of human rights organizations .

but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it . come 2006 , the world ’ s eyes will turn to germany as the next soccer world cup kicks off with the home nation hopefully cheering their boys on to victory in the final game of the prestigious tournament .
in just under three years , german soccer fans will get the chance to see their team attempt to go one better than their efforts in the world cup of 2002 in japan / korea .
for a sport crazy country , the countdown to that summer is almost too much to bear . but for any soccer mad german casting an enquiring look across the atlantic in the direction of columbus , ohio , there may be a surprise in store .
those who can ’ t wait to see rudi völler ’ s men trot out in search of glory in 2006 may find that world cup glory is nearer than they think .
the women ’ s world cup is well underway and the much fancied german team is progressing nicely . quarter finals reached in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer .
after storming to the top of group c with maximum points after thumping a total of 13 goals and conceding only two , germany is now prepared to do battle with russia in the quarter final to be played on october 2 .
if they progress further , they will face either the united states , the current world champions , or olympic gold medallists norway in the semis .
tina theune-meyer ’ s team is seeded third in the championships and look in fine form as they head into the closing stages – not that many fans at home have noticed . how , some may ask , can a nation of such dedicated soccer fanatics fail to be engrossed and enthused by the thought of their compatriots challenging for the most glittering prize in their chosen sport ?
the reason may be that , despite the fact that germany ’ s women are five-time european champions and olympic bronze medallists , women ’ s soccer fails to catch the imagination in the same way as the men ’ s game – at least with male supporters . u.s. league suffers from overdose of sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popular game .
in germany , soccer remains the number one spectator sport , unlike in the united states , where the once highly financed wusa women ’ s soccer league recently announced that it was broke .
there the game has to contend with the popularity of more established sports such as baseball , football – the american kind , basketball and the ailing men ’ s soccer league , possibly one of the reasons for the current poor state of the women 's team . but in germany , women 's soccer just is n't catching on . maybe the age old battle of the sexes is to blame .
while the men ’ s game has been promoted and supported both fanatically and financially since its inception , the women ’ s game has suffered at the hands of sexist administrations and male-dominated organizations for the same amount of time . considering women have been playing the game as long as men - chinese frescoes from the donghan dynasty -lrb- ad 25-220 -rrb- show women playing soccer – it seems more than a little unfair that the development of the women ’ s game has suffered in contrast to the explosion in popularity of the men ’ s . german league banned in 1955 following in the footsteps of the qing dynasty which stamped out women ’ s soccer during its reign during the 1600 ’ s , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- disbanded its own women ’ s soccer league hundreds of years later , echoing the feelings of both their english and dutch counterparts in 1955 by agreeing that “ the game of football is unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged . ”
it took almost twenty years before the women ’ s game was released from its shackles , a period which saw the german men ’ s team win two world cups and one european championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european champions but does anyone care ?
however , in the years since the domestic women ’ s league was reinstated , the game has grown in germany , despite remaining a poor relation to the male bundesliga .
the success of the national team and the impact german players have made in the wusa league - a few of the female stars are actually known by name - have contributed to the comparative rise of the women ’ s bundesliga and a change in public perception .
attempts at gender balance in the 1997/98 season , the structure of the women ’ s bundesliga changed to mirror that of the men ’ s in an attempt to redress the balance .
abandoning the north / south two-tier structure that had been in place since 1991 , the league presented itself as a cohesive body and also adopted the same time span of game played by the men , extending the women ’ s match to a full 90 minutes .
the subsequent professionalism extended to the running of the national team and since the amalgamation of the women ’ s bundesliga , the german team has achieved much in the way of success and the promotion of the women ’ s game .
according to the 2001 dfb statistics , there are 841,817 registered female players in germany .

one of the most recent to leave is boris becker . when boris becker starts looking for accommodation in the swiss tax haven zug , he may be in for a surprise .
houses for sale have become a rarity in the swiss canton , even if one is rich , famous and a former international tennis star .
the district zug , which lies between zurich and lucerne , has become a popular place to live , not just among wealthy swiss from neighboring cantons .
milder tax climate due to its extremely low tax rates , the district has attracted many wealthy germans in addition to former wimbledon champion becker .
tour de france runner-up jan ulrich , party animal gunter sachs and pharmaceutical billionare curt g. engelhorn are among those who have abandoned their home country for a milder tax climate in switzerland . günter netzer , a former german soccer star and popular sports commentator , who already lives in zurich , has registered his sports company infront in zug .
and becker , convicted of tax evasion last year , has announced plans to found a new company in the district together with business partner hans-dieter cleven , one of zug 's ' oldest ' german citizens , who , along with billionaire otto beisheim of the metro group , registered in the canton more than twenty years ago . complaints over tax evaders but not all swiss are happy with the steady flow of german tax evaders , which according to the german-swiss chamber of commerce , saw an apparent increase after the last german general election in september 2002 . attempts by formula one driver michael schumacher to set up camp in lucerne were thwarted when locals discovered that the canton had offered the schumachers special tax rates , exclusive landing rights for their private jet and support in finding an appropriate piece of land .
" the extra attention given to a foreign billionaire by our authorities is scandalous , " swiss social democrat odilo abgottspon said .
following further complaints from locals and a row of protests from environmentalists , the schumacher 's eventually gave up their plans . a similar fate awaited uwe holy , former owner and ceo of fashion house boss .
holy was confronted with local protests after donating 360,000 swiss francs -lrb- $ 274,000 -rrb- to the local branch of the world wildlife fund , which allegedly helped to smother any complaints from the conservationists against the building of holy 's large residence on lake constance . a further case involving metro patriarch otto beisheim led to a dispute between zug 's local government and the district 's tax office , after revelations came out that the office had been working too closely with beisheim . low rates , high costs tax rates in zug are almost half of those in germany .
due to the thousands of letterbox companies , zug is one of the richest cantons in switzerland . however , experts warn that moving abroad to a tax haven like zug is only worth doing for the very wealthy .
tax rates may be low , but the cost of living , including rent and health care costs , is around 40 percent higher in the area than in other western industrial states . that 's may be why , as the german-swiss chamber of commerce reported , the number of germans moving to switzerland has fallen in recent months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boris becker fouls out in court a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .
the german sports legend received a two-year suspended sentence and a heavy fine .

but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it . come 2006 , the world ’ s eyes will turn to germany as the next soccer world cup kicks off with the home nation hopefully cheering their boys on to victory in the final game of the prestigious tournament .
in just under three years , german soccer fans will get the chance to see their team attempt to go one better than their efforts in the world cup of 2002 in japan / korea .
for a sport crazy country , the countdown to that summer is almost too much to bear . but for any soccer mad german casting an enquiring look across the atlantic in the direction of columbus , ohio , there may be a surprise in store .
those who can ’ t wait to see rudi völler ’ s men trot out in search of glory in 2006 may find that world cup glory is nearer than they think .
the women ’ s world cup is well underway and the much fancied german team is progressing nicely . quarter finals reached in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer .
after storming to the top of group c with maximum points after thumping a total of 13 goals and conceding only two , germany is now prepared to do battle with russia in the quarter final to be played on october 2 .
if they progress further , they will face either the united states , the current world champions , or olympic gold medallists norway in the semis .
tina theune-meyer ’ s team is seeded third in the championships and look in fine form as they head into the closing stages – not that many fans at home have noticed . how , some may ask , can a nation of such dedicated soccer fanatics fail to be engrossed and enthused by the thought of their compatriots challenging for the most glittering prize in their chosen sport ?
the reason may be that , despite the fact that germany ’ s women are five-time european champions and olympic bronze medallists , women ’ s soccer fails to catch the imagination in the same way as the men ’ s game – at least with male supporters . u.s. league suffers from overdose of sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popular game .
in germany , soccer remains the number one spectator sport , unlike in the united states , where the once highly financed wusa women ’ s soccer league recently announced that it was broke .
there the game has to contend with the popularity of more established sports such as baseball , football – the american kind , basketball and the ailing men ’ s soccer league , possibly one of the reasons for the current poor state of the women 's team . but in germany , women 's soccer just is n't catching on . maybe the age old battle of the sexes is to blame .
while the men ’ s game has been promoted and supported both fanatically and financially since its inception , the women ’ s game has suffered at the hands of sexist administrations and male-dominated organizations for the same amount of time . considering women have been playing the game as long as men - chinese frescoes from the donghan dynasty -lrb- ad 25-220 -rrb- show women playing soccer – it seems more than a little unfair that the development of the women ’ s game has suffered in contrast to the explosion in popularity of the men ’ s . german league banned in 1955 following in the footsteps of the qing dynasty which stamped out women ’ s soccer during its reign during the 1600 ’ s , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- disbanded its own women ’ s soccer league hundreds of years later , echoing the feelings of both their english and dutch counterparts in 1955 by agreeing that “ the game of football is unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged . ”
it took almost twenty years before the women ’ s game was released from its shackles , a period which saw the german men ’ s team win two world cups and one european championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european champions but does anyone care ?
however , in the years since the domestic women ’ s league was reinstated , the game has grown in germany , despite remaining a poor relation to the male bundesliga .
the success of the national team and the impact german players have made in the wusa league - a few of the female stars are actually known by name - have contributed to the comparative rise of the women ’ s bundesliga and a change in public perception .
attempts at gender balance in the 1997/98 season , the structure of the women ’ s bundesliga changed to mirror that of the men ’ s in an attempt to redress the balance .
abandoning the north / south two-tier structure that had been in place since 1991 , the league presented itself as a cohesive body and also adopted the same time span of game played by the men , extending the women ’ s match to a full 90 minutes .
the subsequent professionalism extended to the running of the national team and since the amalgamation of the women ’ s bundesliga , the german team has achieved much in the way of success and the promotion of the women ’ s game .
according to the 2001 dfb statistics , there are 841,817 registered female players in germany .
women ’ s soccer is , indeed , stronger than generally believed -lrb- at least by men ! -rrb- .
so , for soccer junkies who can ’ t wait until football comes home in 2006 , a little appreciative , manly support should be offered in the direction of germany ’ s women as they contest the world ’ s best for the pride of their nation . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer made stunning for women from the cool to the outrageous to the downright sexy - clothes and accessories inspired by the rough-and-tumble game of soccer are ensuring that women don ’ t get bored while football mania rages .

tour de france runner-up jan ulrich , party animal gunter sachs and pharmaceutical billionare curt g. engelhorn are among those who have abandoned their home country for a milder tax climate in switzerland . günter netzer , a former german soccer star and popular sports commentator , who already lives in zurich , has registered his sports company infront in zug .

" the extra attention given to a foreign billionaire by our authorities is scandalous , " swiss social democrat odilo abgottspon said .
following further complaints from locals and a row of protests from environmentalists , the schumacher 's eventually gave up their plans . a similar fate awaited uwe holy , former owner and ceo of fashion house boss .
holy was confronted with local protests after donating 360,000 swiss francs -lrb- $ 274,000 -rrb- to the local branch of the world wildlife fund , which allegedly helped to smother any complaints from the conservationists against the building of holy 's large residence on lake constance . a further case involving metro patriarch otto beisheim led to a dispute between zug 's local government and the district 's tax office , after revelations came out that the office had been working too closely with beisheim . low rates , high costs tax rates in zug are almost half of those in germany .

" and stop looking at things so pessimistically .
gorbachev , largely credited with ending the arms race and the cold war in the soviet union , said the germans had it relatively good despite the economic crisis the country was facing and stressed that former communist east germany was experiencing " a rejuvenation in all areas . "
the 72-year-old admitted that unemployment was a problem in germany but added , " you have a unique social net worldwide . "
referring to germany 's generous social welfare system , the former reformist premier said , " where else in the world can you find that someone who doesn ’ t work get more money than one who does ? " .
gorbachev said the constant complaining by the germans made him ask himself " do you want to swap with us ?
would you rather have the russian problems ?

spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "
gearing up for rome on saturday , heads of state and government leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states as well as the 10 accession states will come together in rome to finalize the text of europe ’ s first constitution .
germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .
but spain , austria and a number of smaller eu countries are demanding changes - with most complaints dealing with the weighing of votes .
making up thursday ’ s meeting marked the first time schröder and aznar have met since they fell out over the iraq war .
after britain , spain has been one of the most outspoken supporters of washington ’ s efforts to topple the regime of saddam hussein .
though politicians in madrid publicly denied it , the spanish government was said to be privately angered that aznar was not invited to a summit two weeks ago in berlin between schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair .
in berlin on thursday , aznar showed no signs of resentment over that meeting . instead , he seemed intent on finding common ground between spain and germany . aznar and schröder agreed to a common position on iraq , saying that it was time to " look forward . "
aznar said both countries wanted to carry out their share in ensuring that sovereignty is returned as quickly as possible to iraqis .
schröder , meanwhile , said ensuring stability in iraq was a shared responsibility .
additionally , the leaders agreed that europe needed to expand it ’ s military capabilities and that europe should establish a central military command that would plan and direct military missions independently of nato .
but the leaders said the command should not be seen as a competitor to nato , but rather a body that could pick up the slack in defense areas where nato couldn ’ t .

nothing says ' i love you ' like a bunch of carrots .
german farmer , 32 .
well-built , good-looking , outdoors type seeks hard-working woman with marriage in mind .
must like early mornings , long days in the country , inclement weather and the smell of animal waste products . for those who live the life , it is an honorable one , providing sustenance and nutrition for the nation and for those beyond the country ’ s borders .
but the life of the farmer is far from an easy one .
the hard work , the many hours dedicated to the land , the endless concern over crops and herds and the economic situation that barely makes it financially worthwhile at times all add up to making the farmer ’ s existence one few outside the community would choose .
but german farmers are facing up to a more personal problem - finding a partner and hanging onto her . considering all the factors above , it may be understandable why life as the spouse of a farmer who wakes before the sun rises and drops into bed way after it sets - and expects you to do the same - does not appeal to many of those out there looking for a relationship .
a man -lrb- or woman -rrb- who puts the welfare of his pigs before candlelight meals and scatters hay and mud on the marital bed instead of rose petals may not be everyone ’ s vision of the perfect partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alone but never truly alone .
unfortunately , it is these kinds of entrenched stereotypes that are contributing to the lack of interest many farmers across germany are experiencing .
despite technological advances in farming and a drift to more management style farm operations , farmers are still seen as unkempt , mono-syllabic workaholics who always smell of manure , even though many now spend as much time behind a desk as they do in the yard or fields . 400,000 german farmers without partners as if to compound the image that is dogging his fellow farmers , florian reichelt wades through pungent slurry in an outfit that does nothing to promote his attributes as ideal husband material as he laments the lack of love in his life .
at 32 , reichelt should be considered a catch by anyone ’ s standards , a possible posterboy for the farming fraternity .
a large , muscular man with handsome features and good manners , reichelt explained his dilemma , and that of the 400,000 other german farmers who remain unattached , to deutsche welle . “ when girls or women hear you ’ re a farmer , they wrinkle their noses thinking they can smell the cow shed , ” he sighed .
“ others say ‘ no farmers , no rolling in the dirt , no getting up early in the morning ’ . ” no costa del sol come summer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fields as far as the eye can see .
reichelt ’ s longest relationship lasted seven years , but the pressure of his work and the time he dedicated to it caused divisions .
the problems began when , at the height of the harvest , his girlfriend wanted to take three weeks vacation .
farmers ’ partners must face the facts , he said .
summer may mean a holiday for the rest of the world but for it ’ s a farmer 's busiest time . eventually , something had to give .
“ my girlfriend said ‘ it ’ s me or your job ’ and then i said , ‘ yeah , then it ’ s my job ’ . ” although maintaining relationships is a problem for farmers due to the workload and worries surrounding the running of the farm , an even bigger problem is finding a partner in the first place .
many start their careers through inheritance , taking over the family business once their parents enter retirement or in the event of bereavement . the burden of the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's you and me , babe .
often they are handed the huge responsibility at a young age .
while their peers are out at nightclubs , flirting and hooking up , young farmers are striking up meaningful relationships with their prize bulls or wrapping their arms around bails of wheat rather than a pretty girl . the farming community does try and help itself by organizing dances and events , but , as reichelt complained , few ideal partners can be found at such social gatherings .
in an attempt to find true love , reichelt is contemplating joining a specialist dating service for lonely farmers . dating online to the rescue luckily , help is at hand thanks to www.landflirt.de , a farming computer dating agency whose existence goes some way to underline the seriousness of the problem facing the loveless land workers . the idea of a specialized service that offers the hope of love and marriage for german farmers is far from new .
german settlers who came to the united states in the 1800s had their own publication and a network of ‘ bride searchers ’ scouring the promised land for the daughters of pioneers who were looking for a man with land and food to go on the table . nowadays , the needs of the lonely farmer are slightly more complex .
but that hasn ’ t stopped the landflirt site from attracting a steady number of classifieds .
at any one time , there are over 500 male farmers looking for partners on the site and over 200 females .
reichelt ’ s dream woman may be one of them : “ she can have her own job and career but she must be right behind the farm , ” he said .
“ and she must have an interest and confidence in the future of farming . ” he added that a woman looking to have a family life with children could do worse than get hitched to a farmer .
“ we ’ re normally at home in the middle of the day , and in the mornings , it offers good conditions for raising a family . ” economy does little to help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have given farmers a bad press .
however , the negatives unfortunately continue to outweigh the positives .
thanks to adverse media coverage of the current financial situation of german farmers , who have been protesting against the conditions that forced 17,000 farms to close last year , the current perception of them is one of a bunch of whining , unattractive men . sadly , it seems the odds are stacked against those german farmers who are unlucky in love . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de farmers plead for drought relief with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms .

while their peers are out at nightclubs , flirting and hooking up , young farmers are striking up meaningful relationships with their prize bulls or wrapping their arms around bails of wheat rather than a pretty girl . the farming community does try and help itself by organizing dances and events , but , as reichelt complained , few ideal partners can be found at such social gatherings .
in an attempt to find true love , reichelt is contemplating joining a specialist dating service for lonely farmers . dating online to the rescue luckily , help is at hand thanks to www.landflirt.de , a farming computer dating agency whose existence goes some way to underline the seriousness of the problem facing the loveless land workers . the idea of a specialized service that offers the hope of love and marriage for german farmers is far from new .
german settlers who came to the united states in the 1800s had their own publication and a network of ‘ bride searchers ’ scouring the promised land for the daughters of pioneers who were looking for a man with land and food to go on the table . nowadays , the needs of the lonely farmer are slightly more complex .
but that hasn ’ t stopped the landflirt site from attracting a steady number of classifieds .
at any one time , there are over 500 male farmers looking for partners on the site and over 200 females .
reichelt ’ s dream woman may be one of them : “ she can have her own job and career but she must be right behind the farm , ” he said .
“ and she must have an interest and confidence in the future of farming . ” he added that a woman looking to have a family life with children could do worse than get hitched to a farmer .
“ we ’ re normally at home in the middle of the day , and in the mornings , it offers good conditions for raising a family . ” economy does little to help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have given farmers a bad press .
however , the negatives unfortunately continue to outweigh the positives .
thanks to adverse media coverage of the current financial situation of german farmers , who have been protesting against the conditions that forced 17,000 farms to close last year , the current perception of them is one of a bunch of whining , unattractive men . sadly , it seems the odds are stacked against those german farmers who are unlucky in love . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de farmers plead for drought relief with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms .

but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it . come 2006 , the world ’ s eyes will turn to germany as the next soccer world cup kicks off with the home nation hopefully cheering their boys on to victory in the final game of the prestigious tournament .
in just under three years , german soccer fans will get the chance to see their team attempt to go one better than their efforts in the world cup of 2002 in japan / korea .
for a sport crazy country , the countdown to that summer is almost too much to bear . but for any soccer mad german casting an enquiring look across the atlantic in the direction of columbus , ohio , there may be a surprise in store .
those who can ’ t wait to see rudi völler ’ s men trot out in search of glory in 2006 may find that world cup glory is nearer than they think .
the women ’ s world cup is well underway and the much fancied german team is progressing nicely . quarter finals reached in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer .
after storming to the top of group c with maximum points after thumping a total of 13 goals and conceding only two , germany is now prepared to do battle with russia in the quarter final to be played on october 2 .
if they progress further , they will face either the united states , the current world champions , or olympic gold medallists norway in the semis .
tina theune-meyer ’ s team is seeded third in the championships and look in fine form as they head into the closing stages – not that many fans at home have noticed . how , some may ask , can a nation of such dedicated soccer fanatics fail to be engrossed and enthused by the thought of their compatriots challenging for the most glittering prize in their chosen sport ?
the reason may be that , despite the fact that germany ’ s women are five-time european champions and olympic bronze medallists , women ’ s soccer fails to catch the imagination in the same way as the men ’ s game – at least with male supporters . u.s. league suffers from overdose of sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popular game .
in germany , soccer remains the number one spectator sport , unlike in the united states , where the once highly financed wusa women ’ s soccer league recently announced that it was broke .
there the game has to contend with the popularity of more established sports such as baseball , football – the american kind , basketball and the ailing men ’ s soccer league , possibly one of the reasons for the current poor state of the women 's team . but in germany , women 's soccer just is n't catching on . maybe the age old battle of the sexes is to blame .

it took almost twenty years before the women ’ s game was released from its shackles , a period which saw the german men ’ s team win two world cups and one european championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european champions but does anyone care ?
however , in the years since the domestic women ’ s league was reinstated , the game has grown in germany , despite remaining a poor relation to the male bundesliga .
the success of the national team and the impact german players have made in the wusa league - a few of the female stars are actually known by name - have contributed to the comparative rise of the women ’ s bundesliga and a change in public perception .
attempts at gender balance in the 1997/98 season , the structure of the women ’ s bundesliga changed to mirror that of the men ’ s in an attempt to redress the balance .
abandoning the north / south two-tier structure that had been in place since 1991 , the league presented itself as a cohesive body and also adopted the same time span of game played by the men , extending the women ’ s match to a full 90 minutes .
the subsequent professionalism extended to the running of the national team and since the amalgamation of the women ’ s bundesliga , the german team has achieved much in the way of success and the promotion of the women ’ s game .

in time , this data could appear in the form of fingerprints and electronic facial signatures on passports and visas , and provide further identification information via retinal eye scans at airports and borders . the passport proposal , agreed by the commission last week , has now been passed to the european council and european parliament where further discussions and decisions will be made on whether to make it compulsory for all member states to store fingerprint data and digital facial images of nationals and immigrants who apply for visas or residence permits . plan targets 2005 for new passport if brussels does decide in favor of the proposals , it 's possible that the traditional european passports could be replaced by a new biometric version as early as 2005 .
under the current plan , eu governments will be responsible for adopting the new standards .
the eu itself does not have any powers to issue passports or other identity papers for individual member states . biometrics is a method of measuring biological dimensions : fingerprints , iris scans , hand measurement , gait recognition , typing rhythms , and many more facets of personal identification that can be encoded and stored on computer chips . photos and biometric chips for visas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu citizens will require biometric visas by 2005 .
as well as eu passports , entry visas for non-eu citizens will also carry photographs by 2005 and will eventually have to be upgraded to include chips that will include biometric information .
according to a european commission statement , the measures were being proposed as part of the increasing need to guarantee a very high level of security .
" existing security standards are improved even further by the integration of two biometric identifiers , " the statement said , " to combat not only document fraud , but also fraudulent use . " the eu is also planning to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu starting next year , as a means to counter illegal immigration . preparations for the introduction of fingerprinting as a primary means of biometric identification began back in june during the european council meeting in thessaloniki .
the attending members agreed to bolster border security and issue new eu passports with improved identity measures to counter the growing trade in fake identity papers by the end of 2004 . it is thought that the decision to add facial imaging to the proposal was influenced by a similar move by the u.s. government and continuing pressure from washington to upgrade european security . u.s. plans delayed for one year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x marks the spot .

the german interior minister otto schily again voiced his support of the measures at the time of the european commission adoption of the proposal : “ when we have a problem identifying a person or where that person comes from , biometric recognition will make a clear identification possible . ” but the plans have consistently come under attack by human rights groups which have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts in the field of biometrics have also questioned the efficiency of the technology currently available in the fight against international security breaches . problems with individual indentification markus kuhn , a lecturer in computer security at the university of cambridge computer lab , told bbc online that biometrics were “ better at verifying identities than humans were when asked to match unfamiliar faces with small photographs in passports and other identity documents . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would biometrics have helped stop 9/11 ?

spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "
gearing up for rome on saturday , heads of state and government leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states as well as the 10 accession states will come together in rome to finalize the text of europe ’ s first constitution .
germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .
but spain , austria and a number of smaller eu countries are demanding changes - with most complaints dealing with the weighing of votes .
making up thursday ’ s meeting marked the first time schröder and aznar have met since they fell out over the iraq war .
after britain , spain has been one of the most outspoken supporters of washington ’ s efforts to topple the regime of saddam hussein .
though politicians in madrid publicly denied it , the spanish government was said to be privately angered that aznar was not invited to a summit two weeks ago in berlin between schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair .
in berlin on thursday , aznar showed no signs of resentment over that meeting . instead , he seemed intent on finding common ground between spain and germany . aznar and schröder agreed to a common position on iraq , saying that it was time to " look forward . "
aznar said both countries wanted to carry out their share in ensuring that sovereignty is returned as quickly as possible to iraqis .
schröder , meanwhile , said ensuring stability in iraq was a shared responsibility .
additionally , the leaders agreed that europe needed to expand it ’ s military capabilities and that europe should establish a central military command that would plan and direct military missions independently of nato .
but the leaders said the command should not be seen as a competitor to nato , but rather a body that could pick up the slack in defense areas where nato couldn ’ t .
schröder and aznar also stressed the importance of building up europe ’ s capacity within nato . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape after 16 months of debate , the drafters of europe 's first constitution completed their work in july .
eu leaders are hoping to ratify the constitution by this december in rome , the site where the treaty founding the european community was signed in 1958 .
berlin summit scores high for attempt at compromise despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.10.2003 schröder , aznar fail to agree on eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spain 's jose maria aznar -lrb- left -rrb- and germany 's gerhard schröder agree to disagree in berlin .
spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "
gearing up for rome on saturday , heads of state and government leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states as well as the 10 accession states will come together in rome to finalize the text of europe ’ s first constitution .
germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .
but spain , austria and a number of smaller eu countries are demanding changes - with most complaints dealing with the weighing of votes .
making up thursday ’ s meeting marked the first time schröder and aznar have met since they fell out over the iraq war .
after britain , spain has been one of the most outspoken supporters of washington ’ s efforts to topple the regime of saddam hussein .
though politicians in madrid publicly denied it , the spanish government was said to be privately angered that aznar was not invited to a summit two weeks ago in berlin between schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair .
in berlin on thursday , aznar showed no signs of resentment over that meeting . instead , he seemed intent on finding common ground between spain and germany . aznar and schröder agreed to a common position on iraq , saying that it was time to " look forward . "
aznar said both countries wanted to carry out their share in ensuring that sovereignty is returned as quickly as possible to iraqis .
schröder , meanwhile , said ensuring stability in iraq was a shared responsibility .
additionally , the leaders agreed that europe needed to expand it ’ s military capabilities and that europe should establish a central military command that would plan and direct military missions independently of nato .
but the leaders said the command should not be seen as a competitor to nato , but rather a body that could pick up the slack in defense areas where nato couldn ’ t .
schröder and aznar also stressed the importance of building up europe ’ s capacity within nato . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape after 16 months of debate , the drafters of europe 's first constitution completed their work in july .
eu leaders are hoping to ratify the constitution by this december in rome , the site where the treaty founding the european community was signed in 1958 .
berlin summit scores high for attempt at compromise despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.10.2003 eu eyes biometric passport plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all in favor say " eye " some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 . the future is a step closer now that the european commission has adopted a proposal to compel eu member states to compile biometric information of their citizens and those wishing to enter their countries .
in time , this data could appear in the form of fingerprints and electronic facial signatures on passports and visas , and provide further identification information via retinal eye scans at airports and borders . the passport proposal , agreed by the commission last week , has now been passed to the european council and european parliament where further discussions and decisions will be made on whether to make it compulsory for all member states to store fingerprint data and digital facial images of nationals and immigrants who apply for visas or residence permits . plan targets 2005 for new passport if brussels does decide in favor of the proposals , it 's possible that the traditional european passports could be replaced by a new biometric version as early as 2005 .
under the current plan , eu governments will be responsible for adopting the new standards .
the eu itself does not have any powers to issue passports or other identity papers for individual member states . biometrics is a method of measuring biological dimensions : fingerprints , iris scans , hand measurement , gait recognition , typing rhythms , and many more facets of personal identification that can be encoded and stored on computer chips . photos and biometric chips for visas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu citizens will require biometric visas by 2005 .
as well as eu passports , entry visas for non-eu citizens will also carry photographs by 2005 and will eventually have to be upgraded to include chips that will include biometric information .
according to a european commission statement , the measures were being proposed as part of the increasing need to guarantee a very high level of security .
" existing security standards are improved even further by the integration of two biometric identifiers , " the statement said , " to combat not only document fraud , but also fraudulent use . " the eu is also planning to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu starting next year , as a means to counter illegal immigration . preparations for the introduction of fingerprinting as a primary means of biometric identification began back in june during the european council meeting in thessaloniki .
the attending members agreed to bolster border security and issue new eu passports with improved identity measures to counter the growing trade in fake identity papers by the end of 2004 . it is thought that the decision to add facial imaging to the proposal was influenced by a similar move by the u.s. government and continuing pressure from washington to upgrade european security . u.s. plans delayed for one year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x marks the spot .
however , the united states has relented on its strict demands on specific nations to bring their security into line with its own updated passport rules by extending its demand for biometric assimilation by one year .
that means under the u.s. patriot act ; visitors from the european union , japan , new zealand and australia traveling to the us from october 26 , 2004 will need visas containing biometric information if they want to enter the country . some eu member states have already carried out their own tests in advance of the commission decision and the amended u.s. schedule .
the german ministry of the interior has confirmed that it has tested several models for identification .
a spokesman told the financial times deutschland , that the ministry found a system of iris-scanning to be the best although other member states are still more favorable to fingerprints as the best way to identify citizens .
schily speaks of support for measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
the german interior minister otto schily again voiced his support of the measures at the time of the european commission adoption of the proposal : “ when we have a problem identifying a person or where that person comes from , biometric recognition will make a clear identification possible . ” but the plans have consistently come under attack by human rights groups which have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts in the field of biometrics have also questioned the efficiency of the technology currently available in the fight against international security breaches . problems with individual indentification markus kuhn , a lecturer in computer security at the university of cambridge computer lab , told bbc online that biometrics were “ better at verifying identities than humans were when asked to match unfamiliar faces with small photographs in passports and other identity documents . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would biometrics have helped stop 9/11 ?
but he added that their usefulness broke down when used to pick out wanted individuals , such as suspected terrorists , from the mass of people passing through a checkpoint . database size could be problematic there are also concerns about whether the technology could be reliably used on a large scale .
a report issued by the u.s. general accounting office -lrb- gao -rrb- in november 2002 said that the largest iris scanning system currently in use had only 30,000 records . by contrast any system used to verify the identities of people travelling to and from the united states , for example , would have to contain up to 240 million records .
the gao warned that it was " unknown " how a system with many millions of records would perform . it also noted that any biometric system would do little to stem the numbers of illegal immigrants wherever the system was employed because most of them did not enter through recognised ports , and avoided all identity checks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe fingerprints against fraud europe ’ s new system for stemming asylum fraud - an eu-wide fingerprint database - has raised the hackles of human rights organizations .

one of the most recent to leave is boris becker . when boris becker starts looking for accommodation in the swiss tax haven zug , he may be in for a surprise .
houses for sale have become a rarity in the swiss canton , even if one is rich , famous and a former international tennis star .
the district zug , which lies between zurich and lucerne , has become a popular place to live , not just among wealthy swiss from neighboring cantons .
milder tax climate due to its extremely low tax rates , the district has attracted many wealthy germans in addition to former wimbledon champion becker .
tour de france runner-up jan ulrich , party animal gunter sachs and pharmaceutical billionare curt g. engelhorn are among those who have abandoned their home country for a milder tax climate in switzerland . günter netzer , a former german soccer star and popular sports commentator , who already lives in zurich , has registered his sports company infront in zug .
and becker , convicted of tax evasion last year , has announced plans to found a new company in the district together with business partner hans-dieter cleven , one of zug 's ' oldest ' german citizens , who , along with billionaire otto beisheim of the metro group , registered in the canton more than twenty years ago . complaints over tax evaders but not all swiss are happy with the steady flow of german tax evaders , which according to the german-swiss chamber of commerce , saw an apparent increase after the last german general election in september 2002 . attempts by formula one driver michael schumacher to set up camp in lucerne were thwarted when locals discovered that the canton had offered the schumachers special tax rates , exclusive landing rights for their private jet and support in finding an appropriate piece of land .
" the extra attention given to a foreign billionaire by our authorities is scandalous , " swiss social democrat odilo abgottspon said .
following further complaints from locals and a row of protests from environmentalists , the schumacher 's eventually gave up their plans . a similar fate awaited uwe holy , former owner and ceo of fashion house boss .
holy was confronted with local protests after donating 360,000 swiss francs -lrb- $ 274,000 -rrb- to the local branch of the world wildlife fund , which allegedly helped to smother any complaints from the conservationists against the building of holy 's large residence on lake constance . a further case involving metro patriarch otto beisheim led to a dispute between zug 's local government and the district 's tax office , after revelations came out that the office had been working too closely with beisheim . low rates , high costs tax rates in zug are almost half of those in germany .
due to the thousands of letterbox companies , zug is one of the richest cantons in switzerland . however , experts warn that moving abroad to a tax haven like zug is only worth doing for the very wealthy .
tax rates may be low , but the cost of living , including rent and health care costs , is around 40 percent higher in the area than in other western industrial states . that 's may be why , as the german-swiss chamber of commerce reported , the number of germans moving to switzerland has fallen in recent months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boris becker fouls out in court a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .

german farmer , 32 .
well-built , good-looking , outdoors type seeks hard-working woman with marriage in mind .
must like early mornings , long days in the country , inclement weather and the smell of animal waste products . for those who live the life , it is an honorable one , providing sustenance and nutrition for the nation and for those beyond the country ’ s borders .
but the life of the farmer is far from an easy one .
the hard work , the many hours dedicated to the land , the endless concern over crops and herds and the economic situation that barely makes it financially worthwhile at times all add up to making the farmer ’ s existence one few outside the community would choose .
but german farmers are facing up to a more personal problem - finding a partner and hanging onto her . considering all the factors above , it may be understandable why life as the spouse of a farmer who wakes before the sun rises and drops into bed way after it sets - and expects you to do the same - does not appeal to many of those out there looking for a relationship .
a man -lrb- or woman -rrb- who puts the welfare of his pigs before candlelight meals and scatters hay and mud on the marital bed instead of rose petals may not be everyone ’ s vision of the perfect partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alone but never truly alone .
unfortunately , it is these kinds of entrenched stereotypes that are contributing to the lack of interest many farmers across germany are experiencing .
despite technological advances in farming and a drift to more management style farm operations , farmers are still seen as unkempt , mono-syllabic workaholics who always smell of manure , even though many now spend as much time behind a desk as they do in the yard or fields . 400,000 german farmers without partners as if to compound the image that is dogging his fellow farmers , florian reichelt wades through pungent slurry in an outfit that does nothing to promote his attributes as ideal husband material as he laments the lack of love in his life .
at 32 , reichelt should be considered a catch by anyone ’ s standards , a possible posterboy for the farming fraternity .
a large , muscular man with handsome features and good manners , reichelt explained his dilemma , and that of the 400,000 other german farmers who remain unattached , to deutsche welle . “ when girls or women hear you ’ re a farmer , they wrinkle their noses thinking they can smell the cow shed , ” he sighed .
“ others say ‘ no farmers , no rolling in the dirt , no getting up early in the morning ’ . ” no costa del sol come summer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fields as far as the eye can see .
reichelt ’ s longest relationship lasted seven years , but the pressure of his work and the time he dedicated to it caused divisions .
the problems began when , at the height of the harvest , his girlfriend wanted to take three weeks vacation .
farmers ’ partners must face the facts , he said .
summer may mean a holiday for the rest of the world but for it ’ s a farmer 's busiest time . eventually , something had to give .
“ my girlfriend said ‘ it ’ s me or your job ’ and then i said , ‘ yeah , then it ’ s my job ’ . ” although maintaining relationships is a problem for farmers due to the workload and worries surrounding the running of the farm , an even bigger problem is finding a partner in the first place .
many start their careers through inheritance , taking over the family business once their parents enter retirement or in the event of bereavement . the burden of the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's you and me , babe .
often they are handed the huge responsibility at a young age .
while their peers are out at nightclubs , flirting and hooking up , young farmers are striking up meaningful relationships with their prize bulls or wrapping their arms around bails of wheat rather than a pretty girl . the farming community does try and help itself by organizing dances and events , but , as reichelt complained , few ideal partners can be found at such social gatherings .
in an attempt to find true love , reichelt is contemplating joining a specialist dating service for lonely farmers . dating online to the rescue luckily , help is at hand thanks to www.landflirt.de , a farming computer dating agency whose existence goes some way to underline the seriousness of the problem facing the loveless land workers . the idea of a specialized service that offers the hope of love and marriage for german farmers is far from new .
german settlers who came to the united states in the 1800s had their own publication and a network of ‘ bride searchers ’ scouring the promised land for the daughters of pioneers who were looking for a man with land and food to go on the table . nowadays , the needs of the lonely farmer are slightly more complex .
but that hasn ’ t stopped the landflirt site from attracting a steady number of classifieds .
at any one time , there are over 500 male farmers looking for partners on the site and over 200 females .
reichelt ’ s dream woman may be one of them : “ she can have her own job and career but she must be right behind the farm , ” he said .
“ and she must have an interest and confidence in the future of farming . ” he added that a woman looking to have a family life with children could do worse than get hitched to a farmer .
“ we ’ re normally at home in the middle of the day , and in the mornings , it offers good conditions for raising a family . ” economy does little to help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have given farmers a bad press .
however , the negatives unfortunately continue to outweigh the positives .
thanks to adverse media coverage of the current financial situation of german farmers , who have been protesting against the conditions that forced 17,000 farms to close last year , the current perception of them is one of a bunch of whining , unattractive men . sadly , it seems the odds are stacked against those german farmers who are unlucky in love . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de farmers plead for drought relief with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms .

despite technological advances in farming and a drift to more management style farm operations , farmers are still seen as unkempt , mono-syllabic workaholics who always smell of manure , even though many now spend as much time behind a desk as they do in the yard or fields . 400,000 german farmers without partners as if to compound the image that is dogging his fellow farmers , florian reichelt wades through pungent slurry in an outfit that does nothing to promote his attributes as ideal husband material as he laments the lack of love in his life .
at 32 , reichelt should be considered a catch by anyone ’ s standards , a possible posterboy for the farming fraternity .
a large , muscular man with handsome features and good manners , reichelt explained his dilemma , and that of the 400,000 other german farmers who remain unattached , to deutsche welle . “ when girls or women hear you ’ re a farmer , they wrinkle their noses thinking they can smell the cow shed , ” he sighed .
“ others say ‘ no farmers , no rolling in the dirt , no getting up early in the morning ’ . ” no costa del sol come summer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fields as far as the eye can see .
reichelt ’ s longest relationship lasted seven years , but the pressure of his work and the time he dedicated to it caused divisions .
the problems began when , at the height of the harvest , his girlfriend wanted to take three weeks vacation .
farmers ’ partners must face the facts , he said .
summer may mean a holiday for the rest of the world but for it ’ s a farmer 's busiest time . eventually , something had to give .
“ my girlfriend said ‘ it ’ s me or your job ’ and then i said , ‘ yeah , then it ’ s my job ’ . ” although maintaining relationships is a problem for farmers due to the workload and worries surrounding the running of the farm , an even bigger problem is finding a partner in the first place .
many start their careers through inheritance , taking over the family business once their parents enter retirement or in the event of bereavement . the burden of the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's you and me , babe .
often they are handed the huge responsibility at a young age .
while their peers are out at nightclubs , flirting and hooking up , young farmers are striking up meaningful relationships with their prize bulls or wrapping their arms around bails of wheat rather than a pretty girl . the farming community does try and help itself by organizing dances and events , but , as reichelt complained , few ideal partners can be found at such social gatherings .
in an attempt to find true love , reichelt is contemplating joining a specialist dating service for lonely farmers . dating online to the rescue luckily , help is at hand thanks to www.landflirt.de , a farming computer dating agency whose existence goes some way to underline the seriousness of the problem facing the loveless land workers . the idea of a specialized service that offers the hope of love and marriage for german farmers is far from new .
german settlers who came to the united states in the 1800s had their own publication and a network of ‘ bride searchers ’ scouring the promised land for the daughters of pioneers who were looking for a man with land and food to go on the table . nowadays , the needs of the lonely farmer are slightly more complex .
but that hasn ’ t stopped the landflirt site from attracting a steady number of classifieds .
at any one time , there are over 500 male farmers looking for partners on the site and over 200 females .
reichelt ’ s dream woman may be one of them : “ she can have her own job and career but she must be right behind the farm , ” he said .
“ and she must have an interest and confidence in the future of farming . ” he added that a woman looking to have a family life with children could do worse than get hitched to a farmer .
“ we ’ re normally at home in the middle of the day , and in the mornings , it offers good conditions for raising a family . ” economy does little to help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have given farmers a bad press .
however , the negatives unfortunately continue to outweigh the positives .
thanks to adverse media coverage of the current financial situation of german farmers , who have been protesting against the conditions that forced 17,000 farms to close last year , the current perception of them is one of a bunch of whining , unattractive men . sadly , it seems the odds are stacked against those german farmers who are unlucky in love . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de farmers plead for drought relief with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms .

under the current plan , eu governments will be responsible for adopting the new standards .

according to a european commission statement , the measures were being proposed as part of the increasing need to guarantee a very high level of security .

but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it . come 2006 , the world ’ s eyes will turn to germany as the next soccer world cup kicks off with the home nation hopefully cheering their boys on to victory in the final game of the prestigious tournament .
in just under three years , german soccer fans will get the chance to see their team attempt to go one better than their efforts in the world cup of 2002 in japan / korea .
for a sport crazy country , the countdown to that summer is almost too much to bear . but for any soccer mad german casting an enquiring look across the atlantic in the direction of columbus , ohio , there may be a surprise in store .
those who can ’ t wait to see rudi völler ’ s men trot out in search of glory in 2006 may find that world cup glory is nearer than they think .
the women ’ s world cup is well underway and the much fancied german team is progressing nicely . quarter finals reached in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer .
after storming to the top of group c with maximum points after thumping a total of 13 goals and conceding only two , germany is now prepared to do battle with russia in the quarter final to be played on october 2 .
if they progress further , they will face either the united states , the current world champions , or olympic gold medallists norway in the semis .
tina theune-meyer ’ s team is seeded third in the championships and look in fine form as they head into the closing stages – not that many fans at home have noticed . how , some may ask , can a nation of such dedicated soccer fanatics fail to be engrossed and enthused by the thought of their compatriots challenging for the most glittering prize in their chosen sport ?
the reason may be that , despite the fact that germany ’ s women are five-time european champions and olympic bronze medallists , women ’ s soccer fails to catch the imagination in the same way as the men ’ s game – at least with male supporters . u.s. league suffers from overdose of sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popular game .
in germany , soccer remains the number one spectator sport , unlike in the united states , where the once highly financed wusa women ’ s soccer league recently announced that it was broke .
there the game has to contend with the popularity of more established sports such as baseball , football – the american kind , basketball and the ailing men ’ s soccer league , possibly one of the reasons for the current poor state of the women 's team . but in germany , women 's soccer just is n't catching on . maybe the age old battle of the sexes is to blame .
while the men ’ s game has been promoted and supported both fanatically and financially since its inception , the women ’ s game has suffered at the hands of sexist administrations and male-dominated organizations for the same amount of time . considering women have been playing the game as long as men - chinese frescoes from the donghan dynasty -lrb- ad 25-220 -rrb- show women playing soccer – it seems more than a little unfair that the development of the women ’ s game has suffered in contrast to the explosion in popularity of the men ’ s . german league banned in 1955 following in the footsteps of the qing dynasty which stamped out women ’ s soccer during its reign during the 1600 ’ s , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- disbanded its own women ’ s soccer league hundreds of years later , echoing the feelings of both their english and dutch counterparts in 1955 by agreeing that “ the game of football is unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged . ”
it took almost twenty years before the women ’ s game was released from its shackles , a period which saw the german men ’ s team win two world cups and one european championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european champions but does anyone care ?
however , in the years since the domestic women ’ s league was reinstated , the game has grown in germany , despite remaining a poor relation to the male bundesliga .
the success of the national team and the impact german players have made in the wusa league - a few of the female stars are actually known by name - have contributed to the comparative rise of the women ’ s bundesliga and a change in public perception .
attempts at gender balance in the 1997/98 season , the structure of the women ’ s bundesliga changed to mirror that of the men ’ s in an attempt to redress the balance .
abandoning the north / south two-tier structure that had been in place since 1991 , the league presented itself as a cohesive body and also adopted the same time span of game played by the men , extending the women ’ s match to a full 90 minutes .
the subsequent professionalism extended to the running of the national team and since the amalgamation of the women ’ s bundesliga , the german team has achieved much in the way of success and the promotion of the women ’ s game .
according to the 2001 dfb statistics , there are 841,817 registered female players in germany .
women ’ s soccer is , indeed , stronger than generally believed -lrb- at least by men ! -rrb- .
so , for soccer junkies who can ’ t wait until football comes home in 2006 , a little appreciative , manly support should be offered in the direction of germany ’ s women as they contest the world ’ s best for the pride of their nation . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer made stunning for women from the cool to the outrageous to the downright sexy - clothes and accessories inspired by the rough-and-tumble game of soccer are ensuring that women don ’ t get bored while football mania rages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.10.2003 eu eyes biometric passport plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all in favor say " eye " some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 . the future is a step closer now that the european commission has adopted a proposal to compel eu member states to compile biometric information of their citizens and those wishing to enter their countries .
in time , this data could appear in the form of fingerprints and electronic facial signatures on passports and visas , and provide further identification information via retinal eye scans at airports and borders . the passport proposal , agreed by the commission last week , has now been passed to the european council and european parliament where further discussions and decisions will be made on whether to make it compulsory for all member states to store fingerprint data and digital facial images of nationals and immigrants who apply for visas or residence permits . plan targets 2005 for new passport if brussels does decide in favor of the proposals , it 's possible that the traditional european passports could be replaced by a new biometric version as early as 2005 .
under the current plan , eu governments will be responsible for adopting the new standards .
the eu itself does not have any powers to issue passports or other identity papers for individual member states . biometrics is a method of measuring biological dimensions : fingerprints , iris scans , hand measurement , gait recognition , typing rhythms , and many more facets of personal identification that can be encoded and stored on computer chips . photos and biometric chips for visas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu citizens will require biometric visas by 2005 .
as well as eu passports , entry visas for non-eu citizens will also carry photographs by 2005 and will eventually have to be upgraded to include chips that will include biometric information .
according to a european commission statement , the measures were being proposed as part of the increasing need to guarantee a very high level of security .
" existing security standards are improved even further by the integration of two biometric identifiers , " the statement said , " to combat not only document fraud , but also fraudulent use . " the eu is also planning to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu starting next year , as a means to counter illegal immigration . preparations for the introduction of fingerprinting as a primary means of biometric identification began back in june during the european council meeting in thessaloniki .
the attending members agreed to bolster border security and issue new eu passports with improved identity measures to counter the growing trade in fake identity papers by the end of 2004 . it is thought that the decision to add facial imaging to the proposal was influenced by a similar move by the u.s. government and continuing pressure from washington to upgrade european security . u.s. plans delayed for one year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x marks the spot .
however , the united states has relented on its strict demands on specific nations to bring their security into line with its own updated passport rules by extending its demand for biometric assimilation by one year .
that means under the u.s. patriot act ; visitors from the european union , japan , new zealand and australia traveling to the us from october 26 , 2004 will need visas containing biometric information if they want to enter the country . some eu member states have already carried out their own tests in advance of the commission decision and the amended u.s. schedule .
the german ministry of the interior has confirmed that it has tested several models for identification .
a spokesman told the financial times deutschland , that the ministry found a system of iris-scanning to be the best although other member states are still more favorable to fingerprints as the best way to identify citizens .
schily speaks of support for measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
the german interior minister otto schily again voiced his support of the measures at the time of the european commission adoption of the proposal : “ when we have a problem identifying a person or where that person comes from , biometric recognition will make a clear identification possible . ” but the plans have consistently come under attack by human rights groups which have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts in the field of biometrics have also questioned the efficiency of the technology currently available in the fight against international security breaches . problems with individual indentification markus kuhn , a lecturer in computer security at the university of cambridge computer lab , told bbc online that biometrics were “ better at verifying identities than humans were when asked to match unfamiliar faces with small photographs in passports and other identity documents . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would biometrics have helped stop 9/11 ?
but he added that their usefulness broke down when used to pick out wanted individuals , such as suspected terrorists , from the mass of people passing through a checkpoint . database size could be problematic there are also concerns about whether the technology could be reliably used on a large scale .
a report issued by the u.s. general accounting office -lrb- gao -rrb- in november 2002 said that the largest iris scanning system currently in use had only 30,000 records . by contrast any system used to verify the identities of people travelling to and from the united states , for example , would have to contain up to 240 million records .
the gao warned that it was " unknown " how a system with many millions of records would perform . it also noted that any biometric system would do little to stem the numbers of illegal immigrants wherever the system was employed because most of them did not enter through recognised ports , and avoided all identity checks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe fingerprints against fraud europe ’ s new system for stemming asylum fraud - an eu-wide fingerprint database - has raised the hackles of human rights organizations .
-lrb- january 16 , 2003 -rrb- german fingerprinting proposals revealed the eu took a further step towards the ' fortress europe ' mentality when the association of german criminal investigators expressed its desire to introduce compulsory fingerprinting for all citizens in the country .

nothing says ' i love you ' like a bunch of carrots .
german farmer , 32 .
well-built , good-looking , outdoors type seeks hard-working woman with marriage in mind .
must like early mornings , long days in the country , inclement weather and the smell of animal waste products . for those who live the life , it is an honorable one , providing sustenance and nutrition for the nation and for those beyond the country ’ s borders .
but the life of the farmer is far from an easy one .
the hard work , the many hours dedicated to the land , the endless concern over crops and herds and the economic situation that barely makes it financially worthwhile at times all add up to making the farmer ’ s existence one few outside the community would choose .
but german farmers are facing up to a more personal problem - finding a partner and hanging onto her . considering all the factors above , it may be understandable why life as the spouse of a farmer who wakes before the sun rises and drops into bed way after it sets - and expects you to do the same - does not appeal to many of those out there looking for a relationship .
a man -lrb- or woman -rrb- who puts the welfare of his pigs before candlelight meals and scatters hay and mud on the marital bed instead of rose petals may not be everyone ’ s vision of the perfect partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alone but never truly alone .
unfortunately , it is these kinds of entrenched stereotypes that are contributing to the lack of interest many farmers across germany are experiencing .
despite technological advances in farming and a drift to more management style farm operations , farmers are still seen as unkempt , mono-syllabic workaholics who always smell of manure , even though many now spend as much time behind a desk as they do in the yard or fields . 400,000 german farmers without partners as if to compound the image that is dogging his fellow farmers , florian reichelt wades through pungent slurry in an outfit that does nothing to promote his attributes as ideal husband material as he laments the lack of love in his life .
at 32 , reichelt should be considered a catch by anyone ’ s standards , a possible posterboy for the farming fraternity .
a large , muscular man with handsome features and good manners , reichelt explained his dilemma , and that of the 400,000 other german farmers who remain unattached , to deutsche welle . “ when girls or women hear you ’ re a farmer , they wrinkle their noses thinking they can smell the cow shed , ” he sighed .
“ others say ‘ no farmers , no rolling in the dirt , no getting up early in the morning ’ . ” no costa del sol come summer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fields as far as the eye can see .
reichelt ’ s longest relationship lasted seven years , but the pressure of his work and the time he dedicated to it caused divisions .
the problems began when , at the height of the harvest , his girlfriend wanted to take three weeks vacation .
farmers ’ partners must face the facts , he said .
summer may mean a holiday for the rest of the world but for it ’ s a farmer 's busiest time . eventually , something had to give .
“ my girlfriend said ‘ it ’ s me or your job ’ and then i said , ‘ yeah , then it ’ s my job ’ . ” although maintaining relationships is a problem for farmers due to the workload and worries surrounding the running of the farm , an even bigger problem is finding a partner in the first place .
many start their careers through inheritance , taking over the family business once their parents enter retirement or in the event of bereavement . the burden of the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's you and me , babe .
often they are handed the huge responsibility at a young age .
while their peers are out at nightclubs , flirting and hooking up , young farmers are striking up meaningful relationships with their prize bulls or wrapping their arms around bails of wheat rather than a pretty girl . the farming community does try and help itself by organizing dances and events , but , as reichelt complained , few ideal partners can be found at such social gatherings .
in an attempt to find true love , reichelt is contemplating joining a specialist dating service for lonely farmers . dating online to the rescue luckily , help is at hand thanks to www.landflirt.de , a farming computer dating agency whose existence goes some way to underline the seriousness of the problem facing the loveless land workers . the idea of a specialized service that offers the hope of love and marriage for german farmers is far from new .
german settlers who came to the united states in the 1800s had their own publication and a network of ‘ bride searchers ’ scouring the promised land for the daughters of pioneers who were looking for a man with land and food to go on the table . nowadays , the needs of the lonely farmer are slightly more complex .
but that hasn ’ t stopped the landflirt site from attracting a steady number of classifieds .
at any one time , there are over 500 male farmers looking for partners on the site and over 200 females .
reichelt ’ s dream woman may be one of them : “ she can have her own job and career but she must be right behind the farm , ” he said .
“ and she must have an interest and confidence in the future of farming . ” he added that a woman looking to have a family life with children could do worse than get hitched to a farmer .
“ we ’ re normally at home in the middle of the day , and in the mornings , it offers good conditions for raising a family . ” economy does little to help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have given farmers a bad press .
however , the negatives unfortunately continue to outweigh the positives .
thanks to adverse media coverage of the current financial situation of german farmers , who have been protesting against the conditions that forced 17,000 farms to close last year , the current perception of them is one of a bunch of whining , unattractive men . sadly , it seems the odds are stacked against those german farmers who are unlucky in love . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de farmers plead for drought relief with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms .

spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "

germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .
but spain , austria and a number of smaller eu countries are demanding changes - with most complaints dealing with the weighing of votes .
making up thursday ’ s meeting marked the first time schröder and aznar have met since they fell out over the iraq war .
after britain , spain has been one of the most outspoken supporters of washington ’ s efforts to topple the regime of saddam hussein .
though politicians in madrid publicly denied it , the spanish government was said to be privately angered that aznar was not invited to a summit two weeks ago in berlin between schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair .
in berlin on thursday , aznar showed no signs of resentment over that meeting . instead , he seemed intent on finding common ground between spain and germany . aznar and schröder agreed to a common position on iraq , saying that it was time to " look forward . "
aznar said both countries wanted to carry out their share in ensuring that sovereignty is returned as quickly as possible to iraqis .
schröder , meanwhile , said ensuring stability in iraq was a shared responsibility .
additionally , the leaders agreed that europe needed to expand it ’ s military capabilities and that europe should establish a central military command that would plan and direct military missions independently of nato .
but the leaders said the command should not be seen as a competitor to nato , but rather a body that could pick up the slack in defense areas where nato couldn ’ t .

in time , this data could appear in the form of fingerprints and electronic facial signatures on passports and visas , and provide further identification information via retinal eye scans at airports and borders . the passport proposal , agreed by the commission last week , has now been passed to the european council and european parliament where further discussions and decisions will be made on whether to make it compulsory for all member states to store fingerprint data and digital facial images of nationals and immigrants who apply for visas or residence permits . plan targets 2005 for new passport if brussels does decide in favor of the proposals , it 's possible that the traditional european passports could be replaced by a new biometric version as early as 2005 .
under the current plan , eu governments will be responsible for adopting the new standards .
the eu itself does not have any powers to issue passports or other identity papers for individual member states . biometrics is a method of measuring biological dimensions : fingerprints , iris scans , hand measurement , gait recognition , typing rhythms , and many more facets of personal identification that can be encoded and stored on computer chips . photos and biometric chips for visas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu citizens will require biometric visas by 2005 .
as well as eu passports , entry visas for non-eu citizens will also carry photographs by 2005 and will eventually have to be upgraded to include chips that will include biometric information .
according to a european commission statement , the measures were being proposed as part of the increasing need to guarantee a very high level of security .
" existing security standards are improved even further by the integration of two biometric identifiers , " the statement said , " to combat not only document fraud , but also fraudulent use . " the eu is also planning to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu starting next year , as a means to counter illegal immigration . preparations for the introduction of fingerprinting as a primary means of biometric identification began back in june during the european council meeting in thessaloniki .
the attending members agreed to bolster border security and issue new eu passports with improved identity measures to counter the growing trade in fake identity papers by the end of 2004 . it is thought that the decision to add facial imaging to the proposal was influenced by a similar move by the u.s. government and continuing pressure from washington to upgrade european security . u.s. plans delayed for one year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x marks the spot .
however , the united states has relented on its strict demands on specific nations to bring their security into line with its own updated passport rules by extending its demand for biometric assimilation by one year .
that means under the u.s. patriot act ; visitors from the european union , japan , new zealand and australia traveling to the us from october 26 , 2004 will need visas containing biometric information if they want to enter the country . some eu member states have already carried out their own tests in advance of the commission decision and the amended u.s. schedule .
the german ministry of the interior has confirmed that it has tested several models for identification .
a spokesman told the financial times deutschland , that the ministry found a system of iris-scanning to be the best although other member states are still more favorable to fingerprints as the best way to identify citizens .
schily speaks of support for measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
the german interior minister otto schily again voiced his support of the measures at the time of the european commission adoption of the proposal : “ when we have a problem identifying a person or where that person comes from , biometric recognition will make a clear identification possible . ” but the plans have consistently come under attack by human rights groups which have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts in the field of biometrics have also questioned the efficiency of the technology currently available in the fight against international security breaches . problems with individual indentification markus kuhn , a lecturer in computer security at the university of cambridge computer lab , told bbc online that biometrics were “ better at verifying identities than humans were when asked to match unfamiliar faces with small photographs in passports and other identity documents . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would biometrics have helped stop 9/11 ?
but he added that their usefulness broke down when used to pick out wanted individuals , such as suspected terrorists , from the mass of people passing through a checkpoint . database size could be problematic there are also concerns about whether the technology could be reliably used on a large scale .
a report issued by the u.s. general accounting office -lrb- gao -rrb- in november 2002 said that the largest iris scanning system currently in use had only 30,000 records . by contrast any system used to verify the identities of people travelling to and from the united states , for example , would have to contain up to 240 million records .
the gao warned that it was " unknown " how a system with many millions of records would perform . it also noted that any biometric system would do little to stem the numbers of illegal immigrants wherever the system was employed because most of them did not enter through recognised ports , and avoided all identity checks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe fingerprints against fraud europe ’ s new system for stemming asylum fraud - an eu-wide fingerprint database - has raised the hackles of human rights organizations .

nothing says ' i love you ' like a bunch of carrots .
german farmer , 32 .
well-built , good-looking , outdoors type seeks hard-working woman with marriage in mind .
must like early mornings , long days in the country , inclement weather and the smell of animal waste products . for those who live the life , it is an honorable one , providing sustenance and nutrition for the nation and for those beyond the country ’ s borders .
but the life of the farmer is far from an easy one .
the hard work , the many hours dedicated to the land , the endless concern over crops and herds and the economic situation that barely makes it financially worthwhile at times all add up to making the farmer ’ s existence one few outside the community would choose .
but german farmers are facing up to a more personal problem - finding a partner and hanging onto her . considering all the factors above , it may be understandable why life as the spouse of a farmer who wakes before the sun rises and drops into bed way after it sets - and expects you to do the same - does not appeal to many of those out there looking for a relationship .
a man -lrb- or woman -rrb- who puts the welfare of his pigs before candlelight meals and scatters hay and mud on the marital bed instead of rose petals may not be everyone ’ s vision of the perfect partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alone but never truly alone .
unfortunately , it is these kinds of entrenched stereotypes that are contributing to the lack of interest many farmers across germany are experiencing .
despite technological advances in farming and a drift to more management style farm operations , farmers are still seen as unkempt , mono-syllabic workaholics who always smell of manure , even though many now spend as much time behind a desk as they do in the yard or fields . 400,000 german farmers without partners as if to compound the image that is dogging his fellow farmers , florian reichelt wades through pungent slurry in an outfit that does nothing to promote his attributes as ideal husband material as he laments the lack of love in his life .
at 32 , reichelt should be considered a catch by anyone ’ s standards , a possible posterboy for the farming fraternity .
a large , muscular man with handsome features and good manners , reichelt explained his dilemma , and that of the 400,000 other german farmers who remain unattached , to deutsche welle . “ when girls or women hear you ’ re a farmer , they wrinkle their noses thinking they can smell the cow shed , ” he sighed .
“ others say ‘ no farmers , no rolling in the dirt , no getting up early in the morning ’ . ” no costa del sol come summer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fields as far as the eye can see .
reichelt ’ s longest relationship lasted seven years , but the pressure of his work and the time he dedicated to it caused divisions .
the problems began when , at the height of the harvest , his girlfriend wanted to take three weeks vacation .
farmers ’ partners must face the facts , he said .
summer may mean a holiday for the rest of the world but for it ’ s a farmer 's busiest time . eventually , something had to give .
“ my girlfriend said ‘ it ’ s me or your job ’ and then i said , ‘ yeah , then it ’ s my job ’ . ” although maintaining relationships is a problem for farmers due to the workload and worries surrounding the running of the farm , an even bigger problem is finding a partner in the first place .
many start their careers through inheritance , taking over the family business once their parents enter retirement or in the event of bereavement . the burden of the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's you and me , babe .
often they are handed the huge responsibility at a young age .
while their peers are out at nightclubs , flirting and hooking up , young farmers are striking up meaningful relationships with their prize bulls or wrapping their arms around bails of wheat rather than a pretty girl . the farming community does try and help itself by organizing dances and events , but , as reichelt complained , few ideal partners can be found at such social gatherings .
in an attempt to find true love , reichelt is contemplating joining a specialist dating service for lonely farmers . dating online to the rescue luckily , help is at hand thanks to www.landflirt.de , a farming computer dating agency whose existence goes some way to underline the seriousness of the problem facing the loveless land workers . the idea of a specialized service that offers the hope of love and marriage for german farmers is far from new .
german settlers who came to the united states in the 1800s had their own publication and a network of ‘ bride searchers ’ scouring the promised land for the daughters of pioneers who were looking for a man with land and food to go on the table . nowadays , the needs of the lonely farmer are slightly more complex .
but that hasn ’ t stopped the landflirt site from attracting a steady number of classifieds .
at any one time , there are over 500 male farmers looking for partners on the site and over 200 females .
reichelt ’ s dream woman may be one of them : “ she can have her own job and career but she must be right behind the farm , ” he said .
“ and she must have an interest and confidence in the future of farming . ” he added that a woman looking to have a family life with children could do worse than get hitched to a farmer .
“ we ’ re normally at home in the middle of the day , and in the mornings , it offers good conditions for raising a family . ” economy does little to help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have given farmers a bad press .
however , the negatives unfortunately continue to outweigh the positives .
thanks to adverse media coverage of the current financial situation of german farmers , who have been protesting against the conditions that forced 17,000 farms to close last year , the current perception of them is one of a bunch of whining , unattractive men . sadly , it seems the odds are stacked against those german farmers who are unlucky in love . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de farmers plead for drought relief with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms .

nothing says ' i love you ' like a bunch of carrots .
german farmer , 32 .
well-built , good-looking , outdoors type seeks hard-working woman with marriage in mind .
must like early mornings , long days in the country , inclement weather and the smell of animal waste products . for those who live the life , it is an honorable one , providing sustenance and nutrition for the nation and for those beyond the country ’ s borders .
but the life of the farmer is far from an easy one .
the hard work , the many hours dedicated to the land , the endless concern over crops and herds and the economic situation that barely makes it financially worthwhile at times all add up to making the farmer ’ s existence one few outside the community would choose .
but german farmers are facing up to a more personal problem - finding a partner and hanging onto her . considering all the factors above , it may be understandable why life as the spouse of a farmer who wakes before the sun rises and drops into bed way after it sets - and expects you to do the same - does not appeal to many of those out there looking for a relationship .
a man -lrb- or woman -rrb- who puts the welfare of his pigs before candlelight meals and scatters hay and mud on the marital bed instead of rose petals may not be everyone ’ s vision of the perfect partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alone but never truly alone .
unfortunately , it is these kinds of entrenched stereotypes that are contributing to the lack of interest many farmers across germany are experiencing .
despite technological advances in farming and a drift to more management style farm operations , farmers are still seen as unkempt , mono-syllabic workaholics who always smell of manure , even though many now spend as much time behind a desk as they do in the yard or fields . 400,000 german farmers without partners as if to compound the image that is dogging his fellow farmers , florian reichelt wades through pungent slurry in an outfit that does nothing to promote his attributes as ideal husband material as he laments the lack of love in his life .
at 32 , reichelt should be considered a catch by anyone ’ s standards , a possible posterboy for the farming fraternity .
a large , muscular man with handsome features and good manners , reichelt explained his dilemma , and that of the 400,000 other german farmers who remain unattached , to deutsche welle . “ when girls or women hear you ’ re a farmer , they wrinkle their noses thinking they can smell the cow shed , ” he sighed .
“ others say ‘ no farmers , no rolling in the dirt , no getting up early in the morning ’ . ” no costa del sol come summer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fields as far as the eye can see .
reichelt ’ s longest relationship lasted seven years , but the pressure of his work and the time he dedicated to it caused divisions .
the problems began when , at the height of the harvest , his girlfriend wanted to take three weeks vacation .
farmers ’ partners must face the facts , he said .
summer may mean a holiday for the rest of the world but for it ’ s a farmer 's busiest time . eventually , something had to give .
“ my girlfriend said ‘ it ’ s me or your job ’ and then i said , ‘ yeah , then it ’ s my job ’ . ” although maintaining relationships is a problem for farmers due to the workload and worries surrounding the running of the farm , an even bigger problem is finding a partner in the first place .
many start their careers through inheritance , taking over the family business once their parents enter retirement or in the event of bereavement . the burden of the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's you and me , babe .
often they are handed the huge responsibility at a young age .
while their peers are out at nightclubs , flirting and hooking up , young farmers are striking up meaningful relationships with their prize bulls or wrapping their arms around bails of wheat rather than a pretty girl . the farming community does try and help itself by organizing dances and events , but , as reichelt complained , few ideal partners can be found at such social gatherings .
in an attempt to find true love , reichelt is contemplating joining a specialist dating service for lonely farmers . dating online to the rescue luckily , help is at hand thanks to www.landflirt.de , a farming computer dating agency whose existence goes some way to underline the seriousness of the problem facing the loveless land workers . the idea of a specialized service that offers the hope of love and marriage for german farmers is far from new .
german settlers who came to the united states in the 1800s had their own publication and a network of ‘ bride searchers ’ scouring the promised land for the daughters of pioneers who were looking for a man with land and food to go on the table . nowadays , the needs of the lonely farmer are slightly more complex .
but that hasn ’ t stopped the landflirt site from attracting a steady number of classifieds .
at any one time , there are over 500 male farmers looking for partners on the site and over 200 females .
reichelt ’ s dream woman may be one of them : “ she can have her own job and career but she must be right behind the farm , ” he said .
“ and she must have an interest and confidence in the future of farming . ” he added that a woman looking to have a family life with children could do worse than get hitched to a farmer .
“ we ’ re normally at home in the middle of the day , and in the mornings , it offers good conditions for raising a family . ” economy does little to help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have given farmers a bad press .
however , the negatives unfortunately continue to outweigh the positives .

and germany is doing rather well in it . come 2006 , the world ’ s eyes will turn to germany as the next soccer world cup kicks off with the home nation hopefully cheering their boys on to victory in the final game of the prestigious tournament .
in just under three years , german soccer fans will get the chance to see their team attempt to go one better than their efforts in the world cup of 2002 in japan / korea .
for a sport crazy country , the countdown to that summer is almost too much to bear . but for any soccer mad german casting an enquiring look across the atlantic in the direction of columbus , ohio , there may be a surprise in store .
those who can ’ t wait to see rudi völler ’ s men trot out in search of glory in 2006 may find that world cup glory is nearer than they think .
the women ’ s world cup is well underway and the much fancied german team is progressing nicely . quarter finals reached in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer .
after storming to the top of group c with maximum points after thumping a total of 13 goals and conceding only two , germany is now prepared to do battle with russia in the quarter final to be played on october 2 .
if they progress further , they will face either the united states , the current world champions , or olympic gold medallists norway in the semis .
tina theune-meyer ’ s team is seeded third in the championships and look in fine form as they head into the closing stages – not that many fans at home have noticed . how , some may ask , can a nation of such dedicated soccer fanatics fail to be engrossed and enthused by the thought of their compatriots challenging for the most glittering prize in their chosen sport ?

it took almost twenty years before the women ’ s game was released from its shackles , a period which saw the german men ’ s team win two world cups and one european championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european champions but does anyone care ?
however , in the years since the domestic women ’ s league was reinstated , the game has grown in germany , despite remaining a poor relation to the male bundesliga .
the success of the national team and the impact german players have made in the wusa league - a few of the female stars are actually known by name - have contributed to the comparative rise of the women ’ s bundesliga and a change in public perception .
attempts at gender balance in the 1997/98 season , the structure of the women ’ s bundesliga changed to mirror that of the men ’ s in an attempt to redress the balance .
abandoning the north / south two-tier structure that had been in place since 1991 , the league presented itself as a cohesive body and also adopted the same time span of game played by the men , extending the women ’ s match to a full 90 minutes .

in time , this data could appear in the form of fingerprints and electronic facial signatures on passports and visas , and provide further identification information via retinal eye scans at airports and borders . the passport proposal , agreed by the commission last week , has now been passed to the european council and european parliament where further discussions and decisions will be made on whether to make it compulsory for all member states to store fingerprint data and digital facial images of nationals and immigrants who apply for visas or residence permits . plan targets 2005 for new passport if brussels does decide in favor of the proposals , it 's possible that the traditional european passports could be replaced by a new biometric version as early as 2005 .
under the current plan , eu governments will be responsible for adopting the new standards .
the eu itself does not have any powers to issue passports or other identity papers for individual member states . biometrics is a method of measuring biological dimensions : fingerprints , iris scans , hand measurement , gait recognition , typing rhythms , and many more facets of personal identification that can be encoded and stored on computer chips . photos and biometric chips for visas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu citizens will require biometric visas by 2005 .
as well as eu passports , entry visas for non-eu citizens will also carry photographs by 2005 and will eventually have to be upgraded to include chips that will include biometric information .
according to a european commission statement , the measures were being proposed as part of the increasing need to guarantee a very high level of security .
" existing security standards are improved even further by the integration of two biometric identifiers , " the statement said , " to combat not only document fraud , but also fraudulent use . " the eu is also planning to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu starting next year , as a means to counter illegal immigration . preparations for the introduction of fingerprinting as a primary means of biometric identification began back in june during the european council meeting in thessaloniki .
the attending members agreed to bolster border security and issue new eu passports with improved identity measures to counter the growing trade in fake identity papers by the end of 2004 . it is thought that the decision to add facial imaging to the proposal was influenced by a similar move by the u.s. government and continuing pressure from washington to upgrade european security . u.s. plans delayed for one year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x marks the spot .
however , the united states has relented on its strict demands on specific nations to bring their security into line with its own updated passport rules by extending its demand for biometric assimilation by one year .
that means under the u.s. patriot act ; visitors from the european union , japan , new zealand and australia traveling to the us from october 26 , 2004 will need visas containing biometric information if they want to enter the country . some eu member states have already carried out their own tests in advance of the commission decision and the amended u.s. schedule .
the german ministry of the interior has confirmed that it has tested several models for identification .

the attending members agreed to bolster border security and issue new eu passports with improved identity measures to counter the growing trade in fake identity papers by the end of 2004 . it is thought that the decision to add facial imaging to the proposal was influenced by a similar move by the u.s. government and continuing pressure from washington to upgrade european security . u.s. plans delayed for one year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x marks the spot .

but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it . come 2006 , the world ’ s eyes will turn to germany as the next soccer world cup kicks off with the home nation hopefully cheering their boys on to victory in the final game of the prestigious tournament .
in just under three years , german soccer fans will get the chance to see their team attempt to go one better than their efforts in the world cup of 2002 in japan / korea .
for a sport crazy country , the countdown to that summer is almost too much to bear . but for any soccer mad german casting an enquiring look across the atlantic in the direction of columbus , ohio , there may be a surprise in store .
those who can ’ t wait to see rudi völler ’ s men trot out in search of glory in 2006 may find that world cup glory is nearer than they think .
the women ’ s world cup is well underway and the much fancied german team is progressing nicely . quarter finals reached in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer .
after storming to the top of group c with maximum points after thumping a total of 13 goals and conceding only two , germany is now prepared to do battle with russia in the quarter final to be played on october 2 .
if they progress further , they will face either the united states , the current world champions , or olympic gold medallists norway in the semis .
tina theune-meyer ’ s team is seeded third in the championships and look in fine form as they head into the closing stages – not that many fans at home have noticed . how , some may ask , can a nation of such dedicated soccer fanatics fail to be engrossed and enthused by the thought of their compatriots challenging for the most glittering prize in their chosen sport ?
the reason may be that , despite the fact that germany ’ s women are five-time european champions and olympic bronze medallists , women ’ s soccer fails to catch the imagination in the same way as the men ’ s game – at least with male supporters . u.s. league suffers from overdose of sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popular game .
in germany , soccer remains the number one spectator sport , unlike in the united states , where the once highly financed wusa women ’ s soccer league recently announced that it was broke .
there the game has to contend with the popularity of more established sports such as baseball , football – the american kind , basketball and the ailing men ’ s soccer league , possibly one of the reasons for the current poor state of the women 's team . but in germany , women 's soccer just is n't catching on . maybe the age old battle of the sexes is to blame .
while the men ’ s game has been promoted and supported both fanatically and financially since its inception , the women ’ s game has suffered at the hands of sexist administrations and male-dominated organizations for the same amount of time . considering women have been playing the game as long as men - chinese frescoes from the donghan dynasty -lrb- ad 25-220 -rrb- show women playing soccer – it seems more than a little unfair that the development of the women ’ s game has suffered in contrast to the explosion in popularity of the men ’ s . german league banned in 1955 following in the footsteps of the qing dynasty which stamped out women ’ s soccer during its reign during the 1600 ’ s , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- disbanded its own women ’ s soccer league hundreds of years later , echoing the feelings of both their english and dutch counterparts in 1955 by agreeing that “ the game of football is unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged . ”
it took almost twenty years before the women ’ s game was released from its shackles , a period which saw the german men ’ s team win two world cups and one european championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european champions but does anyone care ?
however , in the years since the domestic women ’ s league was reinstated , the game has grown in germany , despite remaining a poor relation to the male bundesliga .
the success of the national team and the impact german players have made in the wusa league - a few of the female stars are actually known by name - have contributed to the comparative rise of the women ’ s bundesliga and a change in public perception .
attempts at gender balance in the 1997/98 season , the structure of the women ’ s bundesliga changed to mirror that of the men ’ s in an attempt to redress the balance .
abandoning the north / south two-tier structure that had been in place since 1991 , the league presented itself as a cohesive body and also adopted the same time span of game played by the men , extending the women ’ s match to a full 90 minutes .
the subsequent professionalism extended to the running of the national team and since the amalgamation of the women ’ s bundesliga , the german team has achieved much in the way of success and the promotion of the women ’ s game .
according to the 2001 dfb statistics , there are 841,817 registered female players in germany .
women ’ s soccer is , indeed , stronger than generally believed -lrb- at least by men ! -rrb- .
so , for soccer junkies who can ’ t wait until football comes home in 2006 , a little appreciative , manly support should be offered in the direction of germany ’ s women as they contest the world ’ s best for the pride of their nation . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer made stunning for women from the cool to the outrageous to the downright sexy - clothes and accessories inspired by the rough-and-tumble game of soccer are ensuring that women don ’ t get bored while football mania rages .

while the men ’ s game has been promoted and supported both fanatically and financially since its inception , the women ’ s game has suffered at the hands of sexist administrations and male-dominated organizations for the same amount of time . considering women have been playing the game as long as men - chinese frescoes from the donghan dynasty -lrb- ad 25-220 -rrb- show women playing soccer – it seems more than a little unfair that the development of the women ’ s game has suffered in contrast to the explosion in popularity of the men ’ s . german league banned in 1955 following in the footsteps of the qing dynasty which stamped out women ’ s soccer during its reign during the 1600 ’ s , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- disbanded its own women ’ s soccer league hundreds of years later , echoing the feelings of both their english and dutch counterparts in 1955 by agreeing that “ the game of football is unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged . ”
it took almost twenty years before the women ’ s game was released from its shackles , a period which saw the german men ’ s team win two world cups and one european championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european champions but does anyone care ?
however , in the years since the domestic women ’ s league was reinstated , the game has grown in germany , despite remaining a poor relation to the male bundesliga .
the success of the national team and the impact german players have made in the wusa league - a few of the female stars are actually known by name - have contributed to the comparative rise of the women ’ s bundesliga and a change in public perception .
attempts at gender balance in the 1997/98 season , the structure of the women ’ s bundesliga changed to mirror that of the men ’ s in an attempt to redress the balance .
abandoning the north / south two-tier structure that had been in place since 1991 , the league presented itself as a cohesive body and also adopted the same time span of game played by the men , extending the women ’ s match to a full 90 minutes .
the subsequent professionalism extended to the running of the national team and since the amalgamation of the women ’ s bundesliga , the german team has achieved much in the way of success and the promotion of the women ’ s game .
according to the 2001 dfb statistics , there are 841,817 registered female players in germany .
women ’ s soccer is , indeed , stronger than generally believed -lrb- at least by men ! -rrb- .
so , for soccer junkies who can ’ t wait until football comes home in 2006 , a little appreciative , manly support should be offered in the direction of germany ’ s women as they contest the world ’ s best for the pride of their nation . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer made stunning for women from the cool to the outrageous to the downright sexy - clothes and accessories inspired by the rough-and-tumble game of soccer are ensuring that women don ’ t get bored while football mania rages .

spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "
gearing up for rome on saturday , heads of state and government leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states as well as the 10 accession states will come together in rome to finalize the text of europe ’ s first constitution .
germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .
but spain , austria and a number of smaller eu countries are demanding changes - with most complaints dealing with the weighing of votes .
making up thursday ’ s meeting marked the first time schröder and aznar have met since they fell out over the iraq war .
after britain , spain has been one of the most outspoken supporters of washington ’ s efforts to topple the regime of saddam hussein .
though politicians in madrid publicly denied it , the spanish government was said to be privately angered that aznar was not invited to a summit two weeks ago in berlin between schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair .
in berlin on thursday , aznar showed no signs of resentment over that meeting . instead , he seemed intent on finding common ground between spain and germany . aznar and schröder agreed to a common position on iraq , saying that it was time to " look forward . "
aznar said both countries wanted to carry out their share in ensuring that sovereignty is returned as quickly as possible to iraqis .
schröder , meanwhile , said ensuring stability in iraq was a shared responsibility .
additionally , the leaders agreed that europe needed to expand it ’ s military capabilities and that europe should establish a central military command that would plan and direct military missions independently of nato .
but the leaders said the command should not be seen as a competitor to nato , but rather a body that could pick up the slack in defense areas where nato couldn ’ t .

nothing says ' i love you ' like a bunch of carrots .
german farmer , 32 .
well-built , good-looking , outdoors type seeks hard-working woman with marriage in mind .
must like early mornings , long days in the country , inclement weather and the smell of animal waste products . for those who live the life , it is an honorable one , providing sustenance and nutrition for the nation and for those beyond the country ’ s borders .
but the life of the farmer is far from an easy one .
the hard work , the many hours dedicated to the land , the endless concern over crops and herds and the economic situation that barely makes it financially worthwhile at times all add up to making the farmer ’ s existence one few outside the community would choose .
but german farmers are facing up to a more personal problem - finding a partner and hanging onto her . considering all the factors above , it may be understandable why life as the spouse of a farmer who wakes before the sun rises and drops into bed way after it sets - and expects you to do the same - does not appeal to many of those out there looking for a relationship .
a man -lrb- or woman -rrb- who puts the welfare of his pigs before candlelight meals and scatters hay and mud on the marital bed instead of rose petals may not be everyone ’ s vision of the perfect partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alone but never truly alone .
unfortunately , it is these kinds of entrenched stereotypes that are contributing to the lack of interest many farmers across germany are experiencing .
despite technological advances in farming and a drift to more management style farm operations , farmers are still seen as unkempt , mono-syllabic workaholics who always smell of manure , even though many now spend as much time behind a desk as they do in the yard or fields . 400,000 german farmers without partners as if to compound the image that is dogging his fellow farmers , florian reichelt wades through pungent slurry in an outfit that does nothing to promote his attributes as ideal husband material as he laments the lack of love in his life .
at 32 , reichelt should be considered a catch by anyone ’ s standards , a possible posterboy for the farming fraternity .
a large , muscular man with handsome features and good manners , reichelt explained his dilemma , and that of the 400,000 other german farmers who remain unattached , to deutsche welle . “ when girls or women hear you ’ re a farmer , they wrinkle their noses thinking they can smell the cow shed , ” he sighed .
“ others say ‘ no farmers , no rolling in the dirt , no getting up early in the morning ’ . ” no costa del sol come summer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fields as far as the eye can see .
reichelt ’ s longest relationship lasted seven years , but the pressure of his work and the time he dedicated to it caused divisions .
the problems began when , at the height of the harvest , his girlfriend wanted to take three weeks vacation .
farmers ’ partners must face the facts , he said .
summer may mean a holiday for the rest of the world but for it ’ s a farmer 's busiest time . eventually , something had to give .
“ my girlfriend said ‘ it ’ s me or your job ’ and then i said , ‘ yeah , then it ’ s my job ’ . ” although maintaining relationships is a problem for farmers due to the workload and worries surrounding the running of the farm , an even bigger problem is finding a partner in the first place .
many start their careers through inheritance , taking over the family business once their parents enter retirement or in the event of bereavement . the burden of the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's you and me , babe .
often they are handed the huge responsibility at a young age .
while their peers are out at nightclubs , flirting and hooking up , young farmers are striking up meaningful relationships with their prize bulls or wrapping their arms around bails of wheat rather than a pretty girl . the farming community does try and help itself by organizing dances and events , but , as reichelt complained , few ideal partners can be found at such social gatherings .
in an attempt to find true love , reichelt is contemplating joining a specialist dating service for lonely farmers . dating online to the rescue luckily , help is at hand thanks to www.landflirt.de , a farming computer dating agency whose existence goes some way to underline the seriousness of the problem facing the loveless land workers . the idea of a specialized service that offers the hope of love and marriage for german farmers is far from new .
german settlers who came to the united states in the 1800s had their own publication and a network of ‘ bride searchers ’ scouring the promised land for the daughters of pioneers who were looking for a man with land and food to go on the table . nowadays , the needs of the lonely farmer are slightly more complex .
but that hasn ’ t stopped the landflirt site from attracting a steady number of classifieds .
at any one time , there are over 500 male farmers looking for partners on the site and over 200 females .
reichelt ’ s dream woman may be one of them : “ she can have her own job and career but she must be right behind the farm , ” he said .
“ and she must have an interest and confidence in the future of farming . ” he added that a woman looking to have a family life with children could do worse than get hitched to a farmer .
“ we ’ re normally at home in the middle of the day , and in the mornings , it offers good conditions for raising a family . ” economy does little to help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have given farmers a bad press .
however , the negatives unfortunately continue to outweigh the positives .
thanks to adverse media coverage of the current financial situation of german farmers , who have been protesting against the conditions that forced 17,000 farms to close last year , the current perception of them is one of a bunch of whining , unattractive men . sadly , it seems the odds are stacked against those german farmers who are unlucky in love . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de farmers plead for drought relief with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms .

german farmer , 32 .
well-built , good-looking , outdoors type seeks hard-working woman with marriage in mind .
must like early mornings , long days in the country , inclement weather and the smell of animal waste products . for those who live the life , it is an honorable one , providing sustenance and nutrition for the nation and for those beyond the country ’ s borders .
but the life of the farmer is far from an easy one .
the hard work , the many hours dedicated to the land , the endless concern over crops and herds and the economic situation that barely makes it financially worthwhile at times all add up to making the farmer ’ s existence one few outside the community would choose .
but german farmers are facing up to a more personal problem - finding a partner and hanging onto her . considering all the factors above , it may be understandable why life as the spouse of a farmer who wakes before the sun rises and drops into bed way after it sets - and expects you to do the same - does not appeal to many of those out there looking for a relationship .

unfortunately , it is these kinds of entrenched stereotypes that are contributing to the lack of interest many farmers across germany are experiencing .
despite technological advances in farming and a drift to more management style farm operations , farmers are still seen as unkempt , mono-syllabic workaholics who always smell of manure , even though many now spend as much time behind a desk as they do in the yard or fields . 400,000 german farmers without partners as if to compound the image that is dogging his fellow farmers , florian reichelt wades through pungent slurry in an outfit that does nothing to promote his attributes as ideal husband material as he laments the lack of love in his life .
at 32 , reichelt should be considered a catch by anyone ’ s standards , a possible posterboy for the farming fraternity .
a large , muscular man with handsome features and good manners , reichelt explained his dilemma , and that of the 400,000 other german farmers who remain unattached , to deutsche welle . “ when girls or women hear you ’ re a farmer , they wrinkle their noses thinking they can smell the cow shed , ” he sighed .
“ others say ‘ no farmers , no rolling in the dirt , no getting up early in the morning ’ . ” no costa del sol come summer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fields as far as the eye can see .
reichelt ’ s longest relationship lasted seven years , but the pressure of his work and the time he dedicated to it caused divisions .
the problems began when , at the height of the harvest , his girlfriend wanted to take three weeks vacation .
farmers ’ partners must face the facts , he said .

spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "
gearing up for rome on saturday , heads of state and government leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states as well as the 10 accession states will come together in rome to finalize the text of europe ’ s first constitution .
germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .
but spain , austria and a number of smaller eu countries are demanding changes - with most complaints dealing with the weighing of votes .
making up thursday ’ s meeting marked the first time schröder and aznar have met since they fell out over the iraq war .
after britain , spain has been one of the most outspoken supporters of washington ’ s efforts to topple the regime of saddam hussein .
though politicians in madrid publicly denied it , the spanish government was said to be privately angered that aznar was not invited to a summit two weeks ago in berlin between schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair .
in berlin on thursday , aznar showed no signs of resentment over that meeting . instead , he seemed intent on finding common ground between spain and germany . aznar and schröder agreed to a common position on iraq , saying that it was time to " look forward . "
aznar said both countries wanted to carry out their share in ensuring that sovereignty is returned as quickly as possible to iraqis .
schröder , meanwhile , said ensuring stability in iraq was a shared responsibility .
additionally , the leaders agreed that europe needed to expand it ’ s military capabilities and that europe should establish a central military command that would plan and direct military missions independently of nato .
but the leaders said the command should not be seen as a competitor to nato , but rather a body that could pick up the slack in defense areas where nato couldn ’ t .
schröder and aznar also stressed the importance of building up europe ’ s capacity within nato . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape after 16 months of debate , the drafters of europe 's first constitution completed their work in july .

spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "
gearing up for rome on saturday , heads of state and government leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states as well as the 10 accession states will come together in rome to finalize the text of europe ’ s first constitution .
germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .
but spain , austria and a number of smaller eu countries are demanding changes - with most complaints dealing with the weighing of votes .

in time , this data could appear in the form of fingerprints and electronic facial signatures on passports and visas , and provide further identification information via retinal eye scans at airports and borders . the passport proposal , agreed by the commission last week , has now been passed to the european council and european parliament where further discussions and decisions will be made on whether to make it compulsory for all member states to store fingerprint data and digital facial images of nationals and immigrants who apply for visas or residence permits . plan targets 2005 for new passport if brussels does decide in favor of the proposals , it 's possible that the traditional european passports could be replaced by a new biometric version as early as 2005 .
under the current plan , eu governments will be responsible for adopting the new standards .
the eu itself does not have any powers to issue passports or other identity papers for individual member states . biometrics is a method of measuring biological dimensions : fingerprints , iris scans , hand measurement , gait recognition , typing rhythms , and many more facets of personal identification that can be encoded and stored on computer chips . photos and biometric chips for visas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu citizens will require biometric visas by 2005 .
as well as eu passports , entry visas for non-eu citizens will also carry photographs by 2005 and will eventually have to be upgraded to include chips that will include biometric information .
according to a european commission statement , the measures were being proposed as part of the increasing need to guarantee a very high level of security .
" existing security standards are improved even further by the integration of two biometric identifiers , " the statement said , " to combat not only document fraud , but also fraudulent use . " the eu is also planning to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu starting next year , as a means to counter illegal immigration . preparations for the introduction of fingerprinting as a primary means of biometric identification began back in june during the european council meeting in thessaloniki .
the attending members agreed to bolster border security and issue new eu passports with improved identity measures to counter the growing trade in fake identity papers by the end of 2004 . it is thought that the decision to add facial imaging to the proposal was influenced by a similar move by the u.s. government and continuing pressure from washington to upgrade european security . u.s. plans delayed for one year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x marks the spot .

the german ministry of the interior has confirmed that it has tested several models for identification .

the german interior minister otto schily again voiced his support of the measures at the time of the european commission adoption of the proposal : “ when we have a problem identifying a person or where that person comes from , biometric recognition will make a clear identification possible . ” but the plans have consistently come under attack by human rights groups which have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .

one of the most recent to leave is boris becker . when boris becker starts looking for accommodation in the swiss tax haven zug , he may be in for a surprise .
houses for sale have become a rarity in the swiss canton , even if one is rich , famous and a former international tennis star .
the district zug , which lies between zurich and lucerne , has become a popular place to live , not just among wealthy swiss from neighboring cantons .
milder tax climate due to its extremely low tax rates , the district has attracted many wealthy germans in addition to former wimbledon champion becker .
tour de france runner-up jan ulrich , party animal gunter sachs and pharmaceutical billionare curt g. engelhorn are among those who have abandoned their home country for a milder tax climate in switzerland . günter netzer , a former german soccer star and popular sports commentator , who already lives in zurich , has registered his sports company infront in zug .
and becker , convicted of tax evasion last year , has announced plans to found a new company in the district together with business partner hans-dieter cleven , one of zug 's ' oldest ' german citizens , who , along with billionaire otto beisheim of the metro group , registered in the canton more than twenty years ago . complaints over tax evaders but not all swiss are happy with the steady flow of german tax evaders , which according to the german-swiss chamber of commerce , saw an apparent increase after the last german general election in september 2002 . attempts by formula one driver michael schumacher to set up camp in lucerne were thwarted when locals discovered that the canton had offered the schumachers special tax rates , exclusive landing rights for their private jet and support in finding an appropriate piece of land .
" the extra attention given to a foreign billionaire by our authorities is scandalous , " swiss social democrat odilo abgottspon said .
following further complaints from locals and a row of protests from environmentalists , the schumacher 's eventually gave up their plans . a similar fate awaited uwe holy , former owner and ceo of fashion house boss .
holy was confronted with local protests after donating 360,000 swiss francs -lrb- $ 274,000 -rrb- to the local branch of the world wildlife fund , which allegedly helped to smother any complaints from the conservationists against the building of holy 's large residence on lake constance . a further case involving metro patriarch otto beisheim led to a dispute between zug 's local government and the district 's tax office , after revelations came out that the office had been working too closely with beisheim . low rates , high costs tax rates in zug are almost half of those in germany .
due to the thousands of letterbox companies , zug is one of the richest cantons in switzerland . however , experts warn that moving abroad to a tax haven like zug is only worth doing for the very wealthy .
tax rates may be low , but the cost of living , including rent and health care costs , is around 40 percent higher in the area than in other western industrial states . that 's may be why , as the german-swiss chamber of commerce reported , the number of germans moving to switzerland has fallen in recent months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boris becker fouls out in court a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .

but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it . come 2006 , the world ’ s eyes will turn to germany as the next soccer world cup kicks off with the home nation hopefully cheering their boys on to victory in the final game of the prestigious tournament .
in just under three years , german soccer fans will get the chance to see their team attempt to go one better than their efforts in the world cup of 2002 in japan / korea .
for a sport crazy country , the countdown to that summer is almost too much to bear . but for any soccer mad german casting an enquiring look across the atlantic in the direction of columbus , ohio , there may be a surprise in store .
those who can ’ t wait to see rudi völler ’ s men trot out in search of glory in 2006 may find that world cup glory is nearer than they think .
the women ’ s world cup is well underway and the much fancied german team is progressing nicely . quarter finals reached in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer .
after storming to the top of group c with maximum points after thumping a total of 13 goals and conceding only two , germany is now prepared to do battle with russia in the quarter final to be played on october 2 .
if they progress further , they will face either the united states , the current world champions , or olympic gold medallists norway in the semis .
tina theune-meyer ’ s team is seeded third in the championships and look in fine form as they head into the closing stages – not that many fans at home have noticed . how , some may ask , can a nation of such dedicated soccer fanatics fail to be engrossed and enthused by the thought of their compatriots challenging for the most glittering prize in their chosen sport ?
the reason may be that , despite the fact that germany ’ s women are five-time european champions and olympic bronze medallists , women ’ s soccer fails to catch the imagination in the same way as the men ’ s game – at least with male supporters . u.s. league suffers from overdose of sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popular game .
in germany , soccer remains the number one spectator sport , unlike in the united states , where the once highly financed wusa women ’ s soccer league recently announced that it was broke .
there the game has to contend with the popularity of more established sports such as baseball , football – the american kind , basketball and the ailing men ’ s soccer league , possibly one of the reasons for the current poor state of the women 's team . but in germany , women 's soccer just is n't catching on . maybe the age old battle of the sexes is to blame .
while the men ’ s game has been promoted and supported both fanatically and financially since its inception , the women ’ s game has suffered at the hands of sexist administrations and male-dominated organizations for the same amount of time . considering women have been playing the game as long as men - chinese frescoes from the donghan dynasty -lrb- ad 25-220 -rrb- show women playing soccer – it seems more than a little unfair that the development of the women ’ s game has suffered in contrast to the explosion in popularity of the men ’ s . german league banned in 1955 following in the footsteps of the qing dynasty which stamped out women ’ s soccer during its reign during the 1600 ’ s , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- disbanded its own women ’ s soccer league hundreds of years later , echoing the feelings of both their english and dutch counterparts in 1955 by agreeing that “ the game of football is unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged . ”
it took almost twenty years before the women ’ s game was released from its shackles , a period which saw the german men ’ s team win two world cups and one european championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european champions but does anyone care ?
however , in the years since the domestic women ’ s league was reinstated , the game has grown in germany , despite remaining a poor relation to the male bundesliga .
the success of the national team and the impact german players have made in the wusa league - a few of the female stars are actually known by name - have contributed to the comparative rise of the women ’ s bundesliga and a change in public perception .
attempts at gender balance in the 1997/98 season , the structure of the women ’ s bundesliga changed to mirror that of the men ’ s in an attempt to redress the balance .
abandoning the north / south two-tier structure that had been in place since 1991 , the league presented itself as a cohesive body and also adopted the same time span of game played by the men , extending the women ’ s match to a full 90 minutes .
the subsequent professionalism extended to the running of the national team and since the amalgamation of the women ’ s bundesliga , the german team has achieved much in the way of success and the promotion of the women ’ s game .
according to the 2001 dfb statistics , there are 841,817 registered female players in germany .
women ’ s soccer is , indeed , stronger than generally believed -lrb- at least by men ! -rrb- .
so , for soccer junkies who can ’ t wait until football comes home in 2006 , a little appreciative , manly support should be offered in the direction of germany ’ s women as they contest the world ’ s best for the pride of their nation . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de soccer made stunning for women from the cool to the outrageous to the downright sexy - clothes and accessories inspired by the rough-and-tumble game of soccer are ensuring that women don ’ t get bored while football mania rages .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 02.10.2003 eu eyes biometric passport plan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all in favor say " eye " some see compulsory fingerprinting as an invasion of civil rights and retinal scanning is thought by many to be the stuff of science fiction , but these measures and more may all be part of a new eu passport come 2005 . the future is a step closer now that the european commission has adopted a proposal to compel eu member states to compile biometric information of their citizens and those wishing to enter their countries .
in time , this data could appear in the form of fingerprints and electronic facial signatures on passports and visas , and provide further identification information via retinal eye scans at airports and borders . the passport proposal , agreed by the commission last week , has now been passed to the european council and european parliament where further discussions and decisions will be made on whether to make it compulsory for all member states to store fingerprint data and digital facial images of nationals and immigrants who apply for visas or residence permits . plan targets 2005 for new passport if brussels does decide in favor of the proposals , it 's possible that the traditional european passports could be replaced by a new biometric version as early as 2005 .
under the current plan , eu governments will be responsible for adopting the new standards .
the eu itself does not have any powers to issue passports or other identity papers for individual member states . biometrics is a method of measuring biological dimensions : fingerprints , iris scans , hand measurement , gait recognition , typing rhythms , and many more facets of personal identification that can be encoded and stored on computer chips . photos and biometric chips for visas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu citizens will require biometric visas by 2005 .
as well as eu passports , entry visas for non-eu citizens will also carry photographs by 2005 and will eventually have to be upgraded to include chips that will include biometric information .
according to a european commission statement , the measures were being proposed as part of the increasing need to guarantee a very high level of security .
" existing security standards are improved even further by the integration of two biometric identifiers , " the statement said , " to combat not only document fraud , but also fraudulent use . " the eu is also planning to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu starting next year , as a means to counter illegal immigration . preparations for the introduction of fingerprinting as a primary means of biometric identification began back in june during the european council meeting in thessaloniki .
the attending members agreed to bolster border security and issue new eu passports with improved identity measures to counter the growing trade in fake identity papers by the end of 2004 . it is thought that the decision to add facial imaging to the proposal was influenced by a similar move by the u.s. government and continuing pressure from washington to upgrade european security . u.s. plans delayed for one year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x marks the spot .
however , the united states has relented on its strict demands on specific nations to bring their security into line with its own updated passport rules by extending its demand for biometric assimilation by one year .
that means under the u.s. patriot act ; visitors from the european union , japan , new zealand and australia traveling to the us from october 26 , 2004 will need visas containing biometric information if they want to enter the country . some eu member states have already carried out their own tests in advance of the commission decision and the amended u.s. schedule .
the german ministry of the interior has confirmed that it has tested several models for identification .
a spokesman told the financial times deutschland , that the ministry found a system of iris-scanning to be the best although other member states are still more favorable to fingerprints as the best way to identify citizens .
schily speaks of support for measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
the german interior minister otto schily again voiced his support of the measures at the time of the european commission adoption of the proposal : “ when we have a problem identifying a person or where that person comes from , biometric recognition will make a clear identification possible . ” but the plans have consistently come under attack by human rights groups which have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts in the field of biometrics have also questioned the efficiency of the technology currently available in the fight against international security breaches . problems with individual indentification markus kuhn , a lecturer in computer security at the university of cambridge computer lab , told bbc online that biometrics were “ better at verifying identities than humans were when asked to match unfamiliar faces with small photographs in passports and other identity documents . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would biometrics have helped stop 9/11 ?
but he added that their usefulness broke down when used to pick out wanted individuals , such as suspected terrorists , from the mass of people passing through a checkpoint . database size could be problematic there are also concerns about whether the technology could be reliably used on a large scale .
a report issued by the u.s. general accounting office -lrb- gao -rrb- in november 2002 said that the largest iris scanning system currently in use had only 30,000 records . by contrast any system used to verify the identities of people travelling to and from the united states , for example , would have to contain up to 240 million records .
the gao warned that it was " unknown " how a system with many millions of records would perform . it also noted that any biometric system would do little to stem the numbers of illegal immigrants wherever the system was employed because most of them did not enter through recognised ports , and avoided all identity checks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe fingerprints against fraud europe ’ s new system for stemming asylum fraud - an eu-wide fingerprint database - has raised the hackles of human rights organizations .

spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "
gearing up for rome on saturday , heads of state and government leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states as well as the 10 accession states will come together in rome to finalize the text of europe ’ s first constitution .
germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .
but spain , austria and a number of smaller eu countries are demanding changes - with most complaints dealing with the weighing of votes .
making up thursday ’ s meeting marked the first time schröder and aznar have met since they fell out over the iraq war .
after britain , spain has been one of the most outspoken supporters of washington ’ s efforts to topple the regime of saddam hussein .
though politicians in madrid publicly denied it , the spanish government was said to be privately angered that aznar was not invited to a summit two weeks ago in berlin between schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair .
in berlin on thursday , aznar showed no signs of resentment over that meeting . instead , he seemed intent on finding common ground between spain and germany . aznar and schröder agreed to a common position on iraq , saying that it was time to " look forward . "
aznar said both countries wanted to carry out their share in ensuring that sovereignty is returned as quickly as possible to iraqis .
schröder , meanwhile , said ensuring stability in iraq was a shared responsibility .
additionally , the leaders agreed that europe needed to expand it ’ s military capabilities and that europe should establish a central military command that would plan and direct military missions independently of nato .
but the leaders said the command should not be seen as a competitor to nato , but rather a body that could pick up the slack in defense areas where nato couldn ’ t .
schröder and aznar also stressed the importance of building up europe ’ s capacity within nato . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape after 16 months of debate , the drafters of europe 's first constitution completed their work in july .
eu leaders are hoping to ratify the constitution by this december in rome , the site where the treaty founding the european community was signed in 1958 .
berlin summit scores high for attempt at compromise despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise .

in time , this data could appear in the form of fingerprints and electronic facial signatures on passports and visas , and provide further identification information via retinal eye scans at airports and borders . the passport proposal , agreed by the commission last week , has now been passed to the european council and european parliament where further discussions and decisions will be made on whether to make it compulsory for all member states to store fingerprint data and digital facial images of nationals and immigrants who apply for visas or residence permits . plan targets 2005 for new passport if brussels does decide in favor of the proposals , it 's possible that the traditional european passports could be replaced by a new biometric version as early as 2005 .
under the current plan , eu governments will be responsible for adopting the new standards .
the eu itself does not have any powers to issue passports or other identity papers for individual member states . biometrics is a method of measuring biological dimensions : fingerprints , iris scans , hand measurement , gait recognition , typing rhythms , and many more facets of personal identification that can be encoded and stored on computer chips . photos and biometric chips for visas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu citizens will require biometric visas by 2005 .
as well as eu passports , entry visas for non-eu citizens will also carry photographs by 2005 and will eventually have to be upgraded to include chips that will include biometric information .
according to a european commission statement , the measures were being proposed as part of the increasing need to guarantee a very high level of security .
" existing security standards are improved even further by the integration of two biometric identifiers , " the statement said , " to combat not only document fraud , but also fraudulent use . " the eu is also planning to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu starting next year , as a means to counter illegal immigration . preparations for the introduction of fingerprinting as a primary means of biometric identification began back in june during the european council meeting in thessaloniki .
the attending members agreed to bolster border security and issue new eu passports with improved identity measures to counter the growing trade in fake identity papers by the end of 2004 . it is thought that the decision to add facial imaging to the proposal was influenced by a similar move by the u.s. government and continuing pressure from washington to upgrade european security . u.s. plans delayed for one year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x marks the spot .

that means under the u.s. patriot act ; visitors from the european union , japan , new zealand and australia traveling to the us from october 26 , 2004 will need visas containing biometric information if they want to enter the country . some eu member states have already carried out their own tests in advance of the commission decision and the amended u.s. schedule .
the german ministry of the interior has confirmed that it has tested several models for identification .
a spokesman told the financial times deutschland , that the ministry found a system of iris-scanning to be the best although other member states are still more favorable to fingerprints as the best way to identify citizens .
schily speaks of support for measures bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : otto schily .
the german interior minister otto schily again voiced his support of the measures at the time of the european commission adoption of the proposal : “ when we have a problem identifying a person or where that person comes from , biometric recognition will make a clear identification possible . ” but the plans have consistently come under attack by human rights groups which have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts in the field of biometrics have also questioned the efficiency of the technology currently available in the fight against international security breaches . problems with individual indentification markus kuhn , a lecturer in computer security at the university of cambridge computer lab , told bbc online that biometrics were “ better at verifying identities than humans were when asked to match unfamiliar faces with small photographs in passports and other identity documents . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would biometrics have helped stop 9/11 ?
but he added that their usefulness broke down when used to pick out wanted individuals , such as suspected terrorists , from the mass of people passing through a checkpoint . database size could be problematic there are also concerns about whether the technology could be reliably used on a large scale .
a report issued by the u.s. general accounting office -lrb- gao -rrb- in november 2002 said that the largest iris scanning system currently in use had only 30,000 records . by contrast any system used to verify the identities of people travelling to and from the united states , for example , would have to contain up to 240 million records .

in time , this data could appear in the form of fingerprints and electronic facial signatures on passports and visas , and provide further identification information via retinal eye scans at airports and borders . the passport proposal , agreed by the commission last week , has now been passed to the european council and european parliament where further discussions and decisions will be made on whether to make it compulsory for all member states to store fingerprint data and digital facial images of nationals and immigrants who apply for visas or residence permits . plan targets 2005 for new passport if brussels does decide in favor of the proposals , it 's possible that the traditional european passports could be replaced by a new biometric version as early as 2005 .
under the current plan , eu governments will be responsible for adopting the new standards .
the eu itself does not have any powers to issue passports or other identity papers for individual member states . biometrics is a method of measuring biological dimensions : fingerprints , iris scans , hand measurement , gait recognition , typing rhythms , and many more facets of personal identification that can be encoded and stored on computer chips . photos and biometric chips for visas bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : non-eu citizens will require biometric visas by 2005 .
as well as eu passports , entry visas for non-eu citizens will also carry photographs by 2005 and will eventually have to be upgraded to include chips that will include biometric information .
according to a european commission statement , the measures were being proposed as part of the increasing need to guarantee a very high level of security .
" existing security standards are improved even further by the integration of two biometric identifiers , " the statement said , " to combat not only document fraud , but also fraudulent use . " the eu is also planning to introduce biometric data on visas and residence permits of third country nationals residing in the eu starting next year , as a means to counter illegal immigration . preparations for the introduction of fingerprinting as a primary means of biometric identification began back in june during the european council meeting in thessaloniki .
the attending members agreed to bolster border security and issue new eu passports with improved identity measures to counter the growing trade in fake identity papers by the end of 2004 . it is thought that the decision to add facial imaging to the proposal was influenced by a similar move by the u.s. government and continuing pressure from washington to upgrade european security . u.s. plans delayed for one year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : x marks the spot .

the german interior minister otto schily again voiced his support of the measures at the time of the european commission adoption of the proposal : “ when we have a problem identifying a person or where that person comes from , biometric recognition will make a clear identification possible . ” but the plans have consistently come under attack by human rights groups which have complained that the storage of such information could be subject to abuse and could be used to record people 's movements .
experts in the field of biometrics have also questioned the efficiency of the technology currently available in the fight against international security breaches . problems with individual indentification markus kuhn , a lecturer in computer security at the university of cambridge computer lab , told bbc online that biometrics were “ better at verifying identities than humans were when asked to match unfamiliar faces with small photographs in passports and other identity documents . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would biometrics have helped stop 9/11 ?

one of the most recent to leave is boris becker . when boris becker starts looking for accommodation in the swiss tax haven zug , he may be in for a surprise .
houses for sale have become a rarity in the swiss canton , even if one is rich , famous and a former international tennis star .
the district zug , which lies between zurich and lucerne , has become a popular place to live , not just among wealthy swiss from neighboring cantons .
milder tax climate due to its extremely low tax rates , the district has attracted many wealthy germans in addition to former wimbledon champion becker .
tour de france runner-up jan ulrich , party animal gunter sachs and pharmaceutical billionare curt g. engelhorn are among those who have abandoned their home country for a milder tax climate in switzerland . günter netzer , a former german soccer star and popular sports commentator , who already lives in zurich , has registered his sports company infront in zug .
and becker , convicted of tax evasion last year , has announced plans to found a new company in the district together with business partner hans-dieter cleven , one of zug 's ' oldest ' german citizens , who , along with billionaire otto beisheim of the metro group , registered in the canton more than twenty years ago . complaints over tax evaders but not all swiss are happy with the steady flow of german tax evaders , which according to the german-swiss chamber of commerce , saw an apparent increase after the last german general election in september 2002 . attempts by formula one driver michael schumacher to set up camp in lucerne were thwarted when locals discovered that the canton had offered the schumachers special tax rates , exclusive landing rights for their private jet and support in finding an appropriate piece of land .
" the extra attention given to a foreign billionaire by our authorities is scandalous , " swiss social democrat odilo abgottspon said .
following further complaints from locals and a row of protests from environmentalists , the schumacher 's eventually gave up their plans . a similar fate awaited uwe holy , former owner and ceo of fashion house boss .
holy was confronted with local protests after donating 360,000 swiss francs -lrb- $ 274,000 -rrb- to the local branch of the world wildlife fund , which allegedly helped to smother any complaints from the conservationists against the building of holy 's large residence on lake constance . a further case involving metro patriarch otto beisheim led to a dispute between zug 's local government and the district 's tax office , after revelations came out that the office had been working too closely with beisheim . low rates , high costs tax rates in zug are almost half of those in germany .
due to the thousands of letterbox companies , zug is one of the richest cantons in switzerland . however , experts warn that moving abroad to a tax haven like zug is only worth doing for the very wealthy .
tax rates may be low , but the cost of living , including rent and health care costs , is around 40 percent higher in the area than in other western industrial states . that 's may be why , as the german-swiss chamber of commerce reported , the number of germans moving to switzerland has fallen in recent months . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de boris becker fouls out in court a german regional court in munich on thursday convicted former tennis star boris becker of tax evasion .

nothing says ' i love you ' like a bunch of carrots .
german farmer , 32 .
well-built , good-looking , outdoors type seeks hard-working woman with marriage in mind .
must like early mornings , long days in the country , inclement weather and the smell of animal waste products . for those who live the life , it is an honorable one , providing sustenance and nutrition for the nation and for those beyond the country ’ s borders .
but the life of the farmer is far from an easy one .
the hard work , the many hours dedicated to the land , the endless concern over crops and herds and the economic situation that barely makes it financially worthwhile at times all add up to making the farmer ’ s existence one few outside the community would choose .
but german farmers are facing up to a more personal problem - finding a partner and hanging onto her . considering all the factors above , it may be understandable why life as the spouse of a farmer who wakes before the sun rises and drops into bed way after it sets - and expects you to do the same - does not appeal to many of those out there looking for a relationship .
a man -lrb- or woman -rrb- who puts the welfare of his pigs before candlelight meals and scatters hay and mud on the marital bed instead of rose petals may not be everyone ’ s vision of the perfect partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alone but never truly alone .
unfortunately , it is these kinds of entrenched stereotypes that are contributing to the lack of interest many farmers across germany are experiencing .
despite technological advances in farming and a drift to more management style farm operations , farmers are still seen as unkempt , mono-syllabic workaholics who always smell of manure , even though many now spend as much time behind a desk as they do in the yard or fields . 400,000 german farmers without partners as if to compound the image that is dogging his fellow farmers , florian reichelt wades through pungent slurry in an outfit that does nothing to promote his attributes as ideal husband material as he laments the lack of love in his life .
at 32 , reichelt should be considered a catch by anyone ’ s standards , a possible posterboy for the farming fraternity .
a large , muscular man with handsome features and good manners , reichelt explained his dilemma , and that of the 400,000 other german farmers who remain unattached , to deutsche welle . “ when girls or women hear you ’ re a farmer , they wrinkle their noses thinking they can smell the cow shed , ” he sighed .
“ others say ‘ no farmers , no rolling in the dirt , no getting up early in the morning ’ . ” no costa del sol come summer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fields as far as the eye can see .
reichelt ’ s longest relationship lasted seven years , but the pressure of his work and the time he dedicated to it caused divisions .
the problems began when , at the height of the harvest , his girlfriend wanted to take three weeks vacation .
farmers ’ partners must face the facts , he said .
summer may mean a holiday for the rest of the world but for it ’ s a farmer 's busiest time . eventually , something had to give .
“ my girlfriend said ‘ it ’ s me or your job ’ and then i said , ‘ yeah , then it ’ s my job ’ . ” although maintaining relationships is a problem for farmers due to the workload and worries surrounding the running of the farm , an even bigger problem is finding a partner in the first place .
many start their careers through inheritance , taking over the family business once their parents enter retirement or in the event of bereavement . the burden of the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's you and me , babe .
often they are handed the huge responsibility at a young age .
while their peers are out at nightclubs , flirting and hooking up , young farmers are striking up meaningful relationships with their prize bulls or wrapping their arms around bails of wheat rather than a pretty girl . the farming community does try and help itself by organizing dances and events , but , as reichelt complained , few ideal partners can be found at such social gatherings .
in an attempt to find true love , reichelt is contemplating joining a specialist dating service for lonely farmers . dating online to the rescue luckily , help is at hand thanks to www.landflirt.de , a farming computer dating agency whose existence goes some way to underline the seriousness of the problem facing the loveless land workers . the idea of a specialized service that offers the hope of love and marriage for german farmers is far from new .
german settlers who came to the united states in the 1800s had their own publication and a network of ‘ bride searchers ’ scouring the promised land for the daughters of pioneers who were looking for a man with land and food to go on the table . nowadays , the needs of the lonely farmer are slightly more complex .
but that hasn ’ t stopped the landflirt site from attracting a steady number of classifieds .
at any one time , there are over 500 male farmers looking for partners on the site and over 200 females .
reichelt ’ s dream woman may be one of them : “ she can have her own job and career but she must be right behind the farm , ” he said .
“ and she must have an interest and confidence in the future of farming . ” he added that a woman looking to have a family life with children could do worse than get hitched to a farmer .
“ we ’ re normally at home in the middle of the day , and in the mornings , it offers good conditions for raising a family . ” economy does little to help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have given farmers a bad press .
however , the negatives unfortunately continue to outweigh the positives .
thanks to adverse media coverage of the current financial situation of german farmers , who have been protesting against the conditions that forced 17,000 farms to close last year , the current perception of them is one of a bunch of whining , unattractive men . sadly , it seems the odds are stacked against those german farmers who are unlucky in love . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de farmers plead for drought relief with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms .

german farmer , 32 .
well-built , good-looking , outdoors type seeks hard-working woman with marriage in mind .
must like early mornings , long days in the country , inclement weather and the smell of animal waste products . for those who live the life , it is an honorable one , providing sustenance and nutrition for the nation and for those beyond the country ’ s borders .
but the life of the farmer is far from an easy one .
the hard work , the many hours dedicated to the land , the endless concern over crops and herds and the economic situation that barely makes it financially worthwhile at times all add up to making the farmer ’ s existence one few outside the community would choose .
but german farmers are facing up to a more personal problem - finding a partner and hanging onto her . considering all the factors above , it may be understandable why life as the spouse of a farmer who wakes before the sun rises and drops into bed way after it sets - and expects you to do the same - does not appeal to many of those out there looking for a relationship .
a man -lrb- or woman -rrb- who puts the welfare of his pigs before candlelight meals and scatters hay and mud on the marital bed instead of rose petals may not be everyone ’ s vision of the perfect partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alone but never truly alone .
unfortunately , it is these kinds of entrenched stereotypes that are contributing to the lack of interest many farmers across germany are experiencing .

nothing says ' i love you ' like a bunch of carrots .
german farmer , 32 .
well-built , good-looking , outdoors type seeks hard-working woman with marriage in mind .
must like early mornings , long days in the country , inclement weather and the smell of animal waste products . for those who live the life , it is an honorable one , providing sustenance and nutrition for the nation and for those beyond the country ’ s borders .
but the life of the farmer is far from an easy one .
the hard work , the many hours dedicated to the land , the endless concern over crops and herds and the economic situation that barely makes it financially worthwhile at times all add up to making the farmer ’ s existence one few outside the community would choose .
but german farmers are facing up to a more personal problem - finding a partner and hanging onto her . considering all the factors above , it may be understandable why life as the spouse of a farmer who wakes before the sun rises and drops into bed way after it sets - and expects you to do the same - does not appeal to many of those out there looking for a relationship .
a man -lrb- or woman -rrb- who puts the welfare of his pigs before candlelight meals and scatters hay and mud on the marital bed instead of rose petals may not be everyone ’ s vision of the perfect partner . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alone but never truly alone .
unfortunately , it is these kinds of entrenched stereotypes that are contributing to the lack of interest many farmers across germany are experiencing .
despite technological advances in farming and a drift to more management style farm operations , farmers are still seen as unkempt , mono-syllabic workaholics who always smell of manure , even though many now spend as much time behind a desk as they do in the yard or fields . 400,000 german farmers without partners as if to compound the image that is dogging his fellow farmers , florian reichelt wades through pungent slurry in an outfit that does nothing to promote his attributes as ideal husband material as he laments the lack of love in his life .
at 32 , reichelt should be considered a catch by anyone ’ s standards , a possible posterboy for the farming fraternity .
a large , muscular man with handsome features and good manners , reichelt explained his dilemma , and that of the 400,000 other german farmers who remain unattached , to deutsche welle . “ when girls or women hear you ’ re a farmer , they wrinkle their noses thinking they can smell the cow shed , ” he sighed .
“ others say ‘ no farmers , no rolling in the dirt , no getting up early in the morning ’ . ” no costa del sol come summer bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fields as far as the eye can see .
reichelt ’ s longest relationship lasted seven years , but the pressure of his work and the time he dedicated to it caused divisions .
the problems began when , at the height of the harvest , his girlfriend wanted to take three weeks vacation .
farmers ’ partners must face the facts , he said .
summer may mean a holiday for the rest of the world but for it ’ s a farmer 's busiest time . eventually , something had to give .
“ my girlfriend said ‘ it ’ s me or your job ’ and then i said , ‘ yeah , then it ’ s my job ’ . ” although maintaining relationships is a problem for farmers due to the workload and worries surrounding the running of the farm , an even bigger problem is finding a partner in the first place .
many start their careers through inheritance , taking over the family business once their parents enter retirement or in the event of bereavement . the burden of the young bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's you and me , babe .
often they are handed the huge responsibility at a young age .
while their peers are out at nightclubs , flirting and hooking up , young farmers are striking up meaningful relationships with their prize bulls or wrapping their arms around bails of wheat rather than a pretty girl . the farming community does try and help itself by organizing dances and events , but , as reichelt complained , few ideal partners can be found at such social gatherings .
in an attempt to find true love , reichelt is contemplating joining a specialist dating service for lonely farmers . dating online to the rescue luckily , help is at hand thanks to www.landflirt.de , a farming computer dating agency whose existence goes some way to underline the seriousness of the problem facing the loveless land workers . the idea of a specialized service that offers the hope of love and marriage for german farmers is far from new .
german settlers who came to the united states in the 1800s had their own publication and a network of ‘ bride searchers ’ scouring the promised land for the daughters of pioneers who were looking for a man with land and food to go on the table . nowadays , the needs of the lonely farmer are slightly more complex .
but that hasn ’ t stopped the landflirt site from attracting a steady number of classifieds .
at any one time , there are over 500 male farmers looking for partners on the site and over 200 females .
reichelt ’ s dream woman may be one of them : “ she can have her own job and career but she must be right behind the farm , ” he said .
“ and she must have an interest and confidence in the future of farming . ” he added that a woman looking to have a family life with children could do worse than get hitched to a farmer .
“ we ’ re normally at home in the middle of the day , and in the mornings , it offers good conditions for raising a family . ” economy does little to help bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have given farmers a bad press .
however , the negatives unfortunately continue to outweigh the positives .
thanks to adverse media coverage of the current financial situation of german farmers , who have been protesting against the conditions that forced 17,000 farms to close last year , the current perception of them is one of a bunch of whining , unattractive men . sadly , it seems the odds are stacked against those german farmers who are unlucky in love . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de farmers plead for drought relief with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms .

but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it . come 2006 , the world ’ s eyes will turn to germany as the next soccer world cup kicks off with the home nation hopefully cheering their boys on to victory in the final game of the prestigious tournament .
in just under three years , german soccer fans will get the chance to see their team attempt to go one better than their efforts in the world cup of 2002 in japan / korea .
for a sport crazy country , the countdown to that summer is almost too much to bear . but for any soccer mad german casting an enquiring look across the atlantic in the direction of columbus , ohio , there may be a surprise in store .
those who can ’ t wait to see rudi völler ’ s men trot out in search of glory in 2006 may find that world cup glory is nearer than they think .
the women ’ s world cup is well underway and the much fancied german team is progressing nicely . quarter finals reached in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer .
after storming to the top of group c with maximum points after thumping a total of 13 goals and conceding only two , germany is now prepared to do battle with russia in the quarter final to be played on october 2 .
if they progress further , they will face either the united states , the current world champions , or olympic gold medallists norway in the semis .
tina theune-meyer ’ s team is seeded third in the championships and look in fine form as they head into the closing stages – not that many fans at home have noticed . how , some may ask , can a nation of such dedicated soccer fanatics fail to be engrossed and enthused by the thought of their compatriots challenging for the most glittering prize in their chosen sport ?
the reason may be that , despite the fact that germany ’ s women are five-time european champions and olympic bronze medallists , women ’ s soccer fails to catch the imagination in the same way as the men ’ s game – at least with male supporters . u.s. league suffers from overdose of sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popular game .

it took almost twenty years before the women ’ s game was released from its shackles , a period which saw the german men ’ s team win two world cups and one european championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european champions but does anyone care ?
however , in the years since the domestic women ’ s league was reinstated , the game has grown in germany , despite remaining a poor relation to the male bundesliga .

and germany is doing rather well in it . come 2006 , the world ’ s eyes will turn to germany as the next soccer world cup kicks off with the home nation hopefully cheering their boys on to victory in the final game of the prestigious tournament .
in just under three years , german soccer fans will get the chance to see their team attempt to go one better than their efforts in the world cup of 2002 in japan / korea .
for a sport crazy country , the countdown to that summer is almost too much to bear . but for any soccer mad german casting an enquiring look across the atlantic in the direction of columbus , ohio , there may be a surprise in store .
those who can ’ t wait to see rudi völler ’ s men trot out in search of glory in 2006 may find that world cup glory is nearer than they think .
the women ’ s world cup is well underway and the much fancied german team is progressing nicely . quarter finals reached in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer .
after storming to the top of group c with maximum points after thumping a total of 13 goals and conceding only two , germany is now prepared to do battle with russia in the quarter final to be played on october 2 .
if they progress further , they will face either the united states , the current world champions , or olympic gold medallists norway in the semis .
tina theune-meyer ’ s team is seeded third in the championships and look in fine form as they head into the closing stages – not that many fans at home have noticed . how , some may ask , can a nation of such dedicated soccer fanatics fail to be engrossed and enthused by the thought of their compatriots challenging for the most glittering prize in their chosen sport ?
the reason may be that , despite the fact that germany ’ s women are five-time european champions and olympic bronze medallists , women ’ s soccer fails to catch the imagination in the same way as the men ’ s game – at least with male supporters . u.s. league suffers from overdose of sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popular game .

it took almost twenty years before the women ’ s game was released from its shackles , a period which saw the german men ’ s team win two world cups and one european championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european champions but does anyone care ?
however , in the years since the domestic women ’ s league was reinstated , the game has grown in germany , despite remaining a poor relation to the male bundesliga .
the success of the national team and the impact german players have made in the wusa league - a few of the female stars are actually known by name - have contributed to the comparative rise of the women ’ s bundesliga and a change in public perception .
attempts at gender balance in the 1997/98 season , the structure of the women ’ s bundesliga changed to mirror that of the men ’ s in an attempt to redress the balance .
abandoning the north / south two-tier structure that had been in place since 1991 , the league presented itself as a cohesive body and also adopted the same time span of game played by the men , extending the women ’ s match to a full 90 minutes .
the subsequent professionalism extended to the running of the national team and since the amalgamation of the women ’ s bundesliga , the german team has achieved much in the way of success and the promotion of the women ’ s game .

spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "
gearing up for rome on saturday , heads of state and government leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states as well as the 10 accession states will come together in rome to finalize the text of europe ’ s first constitution .
germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .
but spain , austria and a number of smaller eu countries are demanding changes - with most complaints dealing with the weighing of votes .
making up thursday ’ s meeting marked the first time schröder and aznar have met since they fell out over the iraq war .
after britain , spain has been one of the most outspoken supporters of washington ’ s efforts to topple the regime of saddam hussein .
though politicians in madrid publicly denied it , the spanish government was said to be privately angered that aznar was not invited to a summit two weeks ago in berlin between schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair .
in berlin on thursday , aznar showed no signs of resentment over that meeting . instead , he seemed intent on finding common ground between spain and germany . aznar and schröder agreed to a common position on iraq , saying that it was time to " look forward . "
aznar said both countries wanted to carry out their share in ensuring that sovereignty is returned as quickly as possible to iraqis .
schröder , meanwhile , said ensuring stability in iraq was a shared responsibility .
additionally , the leaders agreed that europe needed to expand it ’ s military capabilities and that europe should establish a central military command that would plan and direct military missions independently of nato .
but the leaders said the command should not be seen as a competitor to nato , but rather a body that could pick up the slack in defense areas where nato couldn ’ t .
schröder and aznar also stressed the importance of building up europe ’ s capacity within nato . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape after 16 months of debate , the drafters of europe 's first constitution completed their work in july .

spain on thursday continued to protest the voting system proposed for the eu constitution , saying it would favor larger member states .
but germany says it will push for passage of the current draft . at a meeting in berlin on thursday just two days before the start of a major european union conference in rome , germany ’ s chancellor and spain ’ s prime minister dug their heels in further in a disagreement over the draft of europe ’ s first constitution , suggesting that this week 's intergovernmental conference in rome could turn into an eu political tug-of-war .
" it ’ s no secret that we have different opinions on the question of weighing votes , " german chancellor gerhard schröder told reporters at a joint press conference with spanish prime minister josé maria aznar on thursday at a spanish-german forum in berlin .
schröder said germany would push for the adoption of the constitution as drafted this summer by former french president valery giscard d ’ estaing .
he added that any country that had participated in the work of drafting the constitution at the european convention and now wanted amendments needed to " explain their position and find a new consensus . "
the european convention completed its work and submitted a draft constitution in june .
nice or nothing ?
meanwhile , spain ’ s aznar defended his government ’ s criticism of the constitution ’ s proposed " qualified majority voting , " saying that the compromise reached in nice in 2000 should form the basis of any eu institutional reform .
at the eu summit in nice , leaders agreed that each member state would be given a vote at the council of ministers as well as a commissioner on the european commission .
but under the draft constitution , only 15 countries would be given a minister vote – based on a system of rotation .
the draft constitution also calls for decisions to be made by a majority vote of member countries that also represent 60 percent of the total eu population .
smaller and medium-sized countries like spain and poland have complained that this mechanism would stilt decision-making in favor of larger member states like germany and france .
under the current system , spain and poland share voting power that is almost equal to that of the larger states .
both leaders said they would seek to find a compromise by december , but aznar said the onus would be put on advocates of the new voting system to explain how it would be best-suited for the future of the eu .
" it is all about the consensus on institutions in europe that was reached in nice , namely the consensus concerning the 25 , " aznar said .
" if someone wants to change that consensus , they need to explain the reason for it . "
gearing up for rome on saturday , heads of state and government leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states as well as the 10 accession states will come together in rome to finalize the text of europe ’ s first constitution .
germany , france , great britain , italy and the benelux countries are all pushing for the approval of the current draft .
but spain , austria and a number of smaller eu countries are demanding changes - with most complaints dealing with the weighing of votes .
making up thursday ’ s meeting marked the first time schröder and aznar have met since they fell out over the iraq war .
after britain , spain has been one of the most outspoken supporters of washington ’ s efforts to topple the regime of saddam hussein .
though politicians in madrid publicly denied it , the spanish government was said to be privately angered that aznar was not invited to a summit two weeks ago in berlin between schröder , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair .
in berlin on thursday , aznar showed no signs of resentment over that meeting . instead , he seemed intent on finding common ground between spain and germany . aznar and schröder agreed to a common position on iraq , saying that it was time to " look forward . "
aznar said both countries wanted to carry out their share in ensuring that sovereignty is returned as quickly as possible to iraqis .
schröder , meanwhile , said ensuring stability in iraq was a shared responsibility .
additionally , the leaders agreed that europe needed to expand it ’ s military capabilities and that europe should establish a central military command that would plan and direct military missions independently of nato .
but the leaders said the command should not be seen as a competitor to nato , but rather a body that could pick up the slack in defense areas where nato couldn ’ t .
schröder and aznar also stressed the importance of building up europe ’ s capacity within nato . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape after 16 months of debate , the drafters of europe 's first constitution completed their work in july .

berlin summit scores high for attempt at compromise despite remaining differences over the transfer of power and the role of the un in the reconstruction of iraq , the meeting between the leaders of germany , france and britain marked a step in the direction of compromise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 02.10.2003 germany advances in the other world cup großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : something tells me that 's not michael ballack the soccer world cup in germany 2006 is still a long way off .
but to the surprise of some , there is another one happening right now .
and germany is doing rather well in it . come 2006 , the world ’ s eyes will turn to germany as the next soccer world cup kicks off with the home nation hopefully cheering their boys on to victory in the final game of the prestigious tournament .
in just under three years , german soccer fans will get the chance to see their team attempt to go one better than their efforts in the world cup of 2002 in japan / korea .
for a sport crazy country , the countdown to that summer is almost too much to bear . but for any soccer mad german casting an enquiring look across the atlantic in the direction of columbus , ohio , there may be a surprise in store .
those who can ’ t wait to see rudi völler ’ s men trot out in search of glory in 2006 may find that world cup glory is nearer than they think .
the women ’ s world cup is well underway and the much fancied german team is progressing nicely . quarter finals reached in style bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's soccer coach tina theune-meyer .
after storming to the top of group c with maximum points after thumping a total of 13 goals and conceding only two , germany is now prepared to do battle with russia in the quarter final to be played on october 2 .
if they progress further , they will face either the united states , the current world champions , or olympic gold medallists norway in the semis .
tina theune-meyer ’ s team is seeded third in the championships and look in fine form as they head into the closing stages – not that many fans at home have noticed . how , some may ask , can a nation of such dedicated soccer fanatics fail to be engrossed and enthused by the thought of their compatriots challenging for the most glittering prize in their chosen sport ?
the reason may be that , despite the fact that germany ’ s women are five-time european champions and olympic bronze medallists , women ’ s soccer fails to catch the imagination in the same way as the men ’ s game – at least with male supporters . u.s. league suffers from overdose of sport bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popular game .
in germany , soccer remains the number one spectator sport , unlike in the united states , where the once highly financed wusa women ’ s soccer league recently announced that it was broke .
there the game has to contend with the popularity of more established sports such as baseball , football – the american kind , basketball and the ailing men ’ s soccer league , possibly one of the reasons for the current poor state of the women 's team . but in germany , women 's soccer just is n't catching on . maybe the age old battle of the sexes is to blame .
while the men ’ s game has been promoted and supported both fanatically and financially since its inception , the women ’ s game has suffered at the hands of sexist administrations and male-dominated organizations for the same amount of time . considering women have been playing the game as long as men - chinese frescoes from the donghan dynasty -lrb- ad 25-220 -rrb- show women playing soccer – it seems more than a little unfair that the development of the women ’ s game has suffered in contrast to the explosion in popularity of the men ’ s . german league banned in 1955 following in the footsteps of the qing dynasty which stamped out women ’ s soccer during its reign during the 1600 ’ s , the german football association -lrb- dfb -rrb- disbanded its own women ’ s soccer league hundreds of years later , echoing the feelings of both their english and dutch counterparts in 1955 by agreeing that “ the game of football is unsuitable for females and ought not to be encouraged . ”
it took almost twenty years before the women ’ s game was released from its shackles , a period which saw the german men ’ s team win two world cups and one european championship . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european champions but does anyone care ?
however , in the years since the domestic women ’ s league was reinstated , the game has grown in germany , despite remaining a poor relation to the male bundesliga .
the success of the national team and the impact german players have made in the wusa league - a few of the female stars are actually known by name - have contributed to the comparative rise of the women ’ s bundesliga and a change in public perception .
attempts at gender balance in the 1997/98 season , the structure of the women ’ s bundesliga changed to mirror that of the men ’ s in an attempt to redress the balance .
abandoning the north / south two-tier structure that had been in place since 1991 , the league presented itself as a cohesive body and also adopted the same time span of game played by the men , extending the women ’ s match to a full 90 minutes .
the subsequent professionalism extended to the running of the national team and since the amalgamation of the women ’ s bundesliga , the german team has achieved much in the way of success and the promotion of the women ’ s game .
according to the 2001 dfb statistics , there are 841,817 registered female players in germany .
women ’ s soccer is , indeed , stronger than generally believed -lrb- at least by men ! -rrb- .
so , for soccer junkies who can ’ t wait until football comes home in 2006 , a little appreciative , manly support should be offered in the direction of germany ’ s women as they contest the world ’ s best for the pride of their nation . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : soccer made stunning for women from the cool to the outrageous to the downright sexy - clothes and accessories inspired by the rough-and-tumble game of soccer are ensuring that women don ’ t get bored while football mania rages .

do n't drink too much , says dr rosemary taka a brief walk along any high street , and you ca n't fail to notice a whole host of coffee shops all vying for prominence .
in fact the market for coffee sales was worth £ 632m in 2002 .
but is all this coffee consumption bad for our health ?
how much coffee is too much - and does the way your cuppa 's prepared make any difference to its impact on our health ?
to answer those questions , breakfast talked to our resident gp , dr rosemary leonard a recording of this will be available shortly .
the way the coffee is brewed as well as the quantity consumed can affect the caffeine level .
and the rise in the number of trendy coffee shops could be adding to an increase in caffeine intake because the coffee is traditionally drip fed through the filter whereas instant coffee contains a much lower caffeine content .
coffee facts per 150ml cup : a brewed coffee -lrb- drip method -rrb- contains 115mg of caffeine .
an instant coffee contains 65mg of caffeine .
a decaffeinated cup has 3mg caffeine .
a 30ml espresso cup contains 40mg of caffeine .
this compares with a brewed cup of tea which contains 40mg of caffeine and an instant tea which contains just 30mg .
the british coffee association says its research shows drinking three cups of coffee a day can reduce the risk of fatal liver disease by up to 40 percent .
scientists have discovered that coffee protects against liver cirrhosis , a life-threatening illness usually caused by drinking too much alcohol , which kills around 4,000 britons every year .
research also shows that drinking three cups of coffee a day can reduce the risk of developing alzheimer 's disease by as much as 60 % .
the faculty of medicine in lisbon , portugal found that healthy elderly people , with no signs of the brain disease , had consumed an average of three to four cups of coffee a day since the age of 25 .
link with brain disease however , those with the illness - which affects one in ten britain 's over the age of 85 - drank just one coffee a day .
80 % of adults drink coffee within the course of a week .
coffee is not the only beverage to contain caffeine , but it does contain the most .
caffeine acts as a stimulant to the heart and central nervous system .
caffeine is also known to increase blood pressure in the short-term , although there is no conclusive evidence that there are long-term effects on blood pressure .
the effects are most likely when excessive quantities are taken or in highly sensitive people for example , those with high blood pressure / pregnant women .
coffee has been linked with a number of the risk factors for coronary heart disease , including increased blood pressure and high blood cholesterol levels .
however , no relationship has been found between coffee drinkers and likelihood of developing coronary heart disease .
there is no evidence that coffee does any long-term harm .
however , caffeine does have a very mild diuretic effect - so it 's recommended drinkers have a glass of water afterwards to counteract it .

six of the cameras , which can log the speed of two cars simultaneously and can send images down a phone line , have been installed in the limehouse link .
surveys by road safety campaigners found 50,000 of the 80,000 drivers using the tunnel each day ignore the 30mph speed limit .
in the last three years 18 people have been killed or seriously injured there and another 63 have suffered minor injuries .
regular speed cameras can not be used because the 1.8 kilometre tunnel , which links the city to docklands , would have to be closed at regular intervals to take out the film .
the new cameras do not need servicing , do not run out of film , and can send out fines within 24 hours .
each one of us is responsible for other people on the road as well bob gayle , crash victim 's father the digital images can be encrypted and sent to a metropolitan police centre in kent .
the london safety camera partnership says the cameras are being introduced to " reduce casualties , not to increase offences " .
they say since cameras were installed in july , drivers have begun to slow down .
edmund king , from the motoring organisation rac said speed was not the only cause of accidents and cameras did not pick up drunk drivers or tail-gaters .
but bob gayle , whose son was killed in a crash 4 years ago , said speeding was one of the " crucial factors " determining whether crash victims lived or died .
he told bbc london : " i hear these stories about it being a way for the police to raise income and so on and it is absolute nonsense .

market stall worker debbie pierce began the bury black pudding company on the web in may 2002 and is now one step away from being named as the uk 's best young business .
the company has beaten off fierce competition to reach the final of the hsbc start-up awards 2003 .
ms pierce said she had the idea for the company after being amazed at how far people would travel to get to bury - the traditional home of the black pudding .
she began with a budget of £ 1,000 to pay for the website and adverts in farmers ' fields close to major motorway junctions .
' tough competition ' but she says her biggest breakthrough was in persuading asda to stock her wares .
the supermarket now has plans to stock the north west delicacy at 75 stores .
john rendall , head of business banking at hsbc bank , said : " a record number of entries made this year 's competition very tough .
" the bury black pudding company was up against some outstanding businesses and they should be justly proud of their achievement .
" the bury black pudding company is a great example of how people with guts and determination , backed by careful planning , can create an exciting new business . "

the department of trade and industry -lrb- dti -rrb- has appealed against the employment tribunal ruling in the case of two pensioners , from essex and london .
the tribunal , in august , gave the pensioners the right to claim unfair dismissal and redundancy pay .
if the appeal is rejected , the original case brought by john rutherford , 72 , from rainham , and samuel bentley , 75 , from islington , could pave the way to full employment rights for hundreds of thousands of people working beyond state pension age .
indirect sexual discrimination currently , workers over 65 can not claim unfair dismissal or redundancy payments , on the grounds that they can draw a state pension .
but mr rutherford and mr bentley argued under european law that they suffered indirect sexual discrimination because more men than women over 65 continued working .
mr rutherford , who worked for clothes wholesaler harvest town circle in london , was not given any redundancy payments when he was laid off at 67 .
neither was mr bentley , who lost his job as a tailor for london-based bodner elen limited when he was 73 .
in a joint action at stratford employment tribunal in east london , the men challenged the trade and industry secretary because both their former employers had ceased trading .
unfair dismissal but in may this year lawyers for the dti told the employment appeal tribunal in central london that the original hearing had ignored relevant statistics .
david pannick qc , representing the dti , said it was incorrect to conclude there was sexual discrimination against men when the majority of the workforce was under 65 , and therefore not discriminated against by the law .
although the arguments during the original tribunal centred on sex discrimination , the decision will apply to both men and women .
according to age concern england , numerous other workers over 65 could bring cases of unfair dismissal and redundancy payments if the appeal is rejected .
the charity estimates there are about 250,000 employees over 65 in the uk .
even if the appeal is upheld on thursday , the government is still committed to implement a european directive on equal treatment , which includes a ban on age discrimination , by 2006 .
both parties will have the option to lodge a further appeal against thursday 's judgement .

the company said on thursday that it expected house price inflation to return to the rate of earnings growth over the next nine months .
that would reduce average house price growth to just over 3 % a year , down sharply from leading mortgage lenders ' current estimates of between 15 % and 19 % .
however , northern rock moved to dispel fears of a property market slump , saying a sound economy would ensure that demand for mortgages remained buoyant .
the company said steady economic growth and continued low levels of unemployment would underpin the mortgage market for the remainder of 2003 and 2004 .
rate effect the lender also played down recent warnings that a rise in interest rates could have a disproportionate effect on house prices by deterring heavily indebted consumers from buying property .
it said higher borrowing costs were likely to have a " more noticeable impact " on unsecured loans and credit card use than on demand for home loans .
northern rock added that high levels of consumer debt would enable the bank of england to curb excessive demand through smaller than usual increases in interest rates .
the lender 's property market outlook came as it reported strong growth in its mortgage business , with net residential lending for the first nine months of 2003 up by 41 % on the same period last year .
it added that there was no sign that its customers were having difficulty repaying their home loans , with three month arrears standing at about half the industry average .
" once again we are delivering strong lending whilst maintaining tight control over costs , credit quality and lending criteria , " said northern rock chief executive adam j applegarth .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- politics -pipe- blair 's ' black wednesday ' ?

by nick assinder bbc news online political correspondent as black wednesdays go , tony blair 's was a massive damp squib .
yes , he lost two crucial votes over foundation hospitals .
and yes , he heard the full extent of anger over the war on iraq .
blair will not accept nhs defeat but not only were the walls of the bournemouth conference centre left remarkably blood free , there was a resigned acknowledgement amongst many delegates that none of it had mattered anyway .
the government 's policies will not change , and the war is a fact of life .
the speakers said so themselves .
health secretary john reid got his retaliation in first by declaring long before the hospitals votes he might lose the ballots but he had won the argument .
and a couple of speakers in the iraq debate actually used the expression when referring to the war that " we are where we are " .
so that 's ok then .
key decisions well , for a large section of this conference , it is not ok and it never will be ok .
even the prime minister 's pleading yet unrepentant speech had not changed their minds on these key decisions .
maybe they -lsb- delegates -rsb- just thought he -lsb- mr hoon -rsb- was already dead meat so was n't worth kicking but experience has already shown them precisely what the prime minister thinks of their opinions .
last year he headed off the worst by appearing to promise he would not go to war without a second un resolution .
he did n't get one and still went to war - as he was always going to do .
they were not happy about that and they said so this year .
and then there was geoff hoon , the defence secretary who appears to be holding a grenade with the pin removed .
they do n't like him and , along with most other observers , believe he will take the rap for the david kelly affair .
but did they monster him , as some had suggested they would ?
no they emphatically did not .
that may partly have been because of some careful timing of speakers - particularly putting an emotional and wholly sincere ann clwyd up before mr hoon to graphically set out some of the worst horrors perpetrated by saddam hussein .
and it may partly have been the defence secretary 's decision to call to the platform two of saddam 's victims - a decision later branded by some as hugely cynical .
sizeable defeats maybe they just thought he was already dead meat so was n't worth kicking .
whatever the reason though , he remained " unmonstered " .
similarly , the prime minister has talked about listening to conference 's concerns , but then ploughed on regardless on public sector reforms .
so they inflicted a couple of sizeable and not insignificant defeats on him .
yet , unlike labour conferences of the past , none of this led to frantic speculation about a fatally divided party or beleaguered leadership .
it is also likely that home secretary david blunkett will get a chilly response on thursday if he attempts to sell his identity cards scheme .
but there is an overwhelming torpor hanging over the entire proceedings .
maybe they know they now have to resort to other means if they want to have any effect on this government .
those other means include the ballot box - see brent east .
and that could prove decidedly more black than any conference wednesday .
