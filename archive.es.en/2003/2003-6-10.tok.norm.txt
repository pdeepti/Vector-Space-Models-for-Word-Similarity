vacationers in europe will be relieved to know that most bathing waters in the eu are clean .
the seaside , in particular , is mainly free from pollution , a recent report on water quality shows . parents can send their offspring into the waves with a clear conscience this summer , since a report revealed the quality of bathing waters in most of the european union 's coasts and lakes was very high .
the continent 's most popular beach holiday destinations , greece , italy , portugal and spain , complied more than 96 percent with eu water quality directives , an eu study published late last week shows .
but germany and france did n't fulfill the regulations ; their water quality has decreased over the past few years .
the results compiled for 2002 showed that 95.8 percent of coastal sites and 91 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu 's compulsory standards , despite the torrential rains and floods that plagued central europe in august and september 2002 .
the report took account of samples analyzed in 13,627 coastal beaches and 5,773 freshwater areas " the impact of water quality on bathers is a clear demonstration of the linkages between environmental quality and human health , " eu environment commissioner margot wallström said while introducing the report .
" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "
wallström criticized the tendency among some states to ban bathing or strike locations from lists of bathing sites in places that did not meet eu 's standards .
instead , she said , states should deal with the causes of pollution .
poor results in germany , france germany scored lower than the previous year with 97.3 percent compliance for saltwater sites , two percent less than last year .
the situation was more dramatic in german lakes , which slid by six percentage points to 83 percent .
the drop was reportedly due to heavy rains and floods .
nonetheless , germany 's larger lakes like bodensee , chiemsee , schliersee and tegernsee , as well as all but two in berlin were declared safe .
in france compliance rates were among the lowest for all eu countries .
only 87.5 percent of coastal waters and 89.6 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu directive .
the netherlands , by contrast , displayed the eu 's highest standards , with 100 percent of all waters fully compliant .
the bathing water directive established in 1976 looks mainly at fecal contamination and whether the water looks appealing to swim in .
samples are supposed to be taken every two weeks as well as a fortnight before the local bathing season begins . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european forests thriving in high ozone areas growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving .

the possibility of u.s. military bases in western europe moving east to nato members like the czech republic has sparked a debate in a country still getting over decades of soviet occupation . the last foreign troops based in the czech republic swore allegiance to the ussr .
when the 75,000 soviet soldiers left the country following the collapse of the iron curtain in the early 1990s , many in the czech republic hoped it was the last time soldiers under a foreign flag would set up shop on their home soil .
now , there 's very serious talk in the pentagon of relocating u.s. bases in western europe east to countries like poland and the czech republic - and the country finds itself in the middle of a hot debate .
czechs " are very touchy when it comes to foreign soldiers on our territory .
the renewed stationing of foreign troops would probably not be welcome , " said czech president vaclav klaus in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung last month .
czechs more skeptical than poles the remarks unleashed hefty discussion within the government and parliament .
though government officials largely supported the war against saddam hussein , they stopped short of committing any military personnel , like poland .
there are other signs to indicate they do not share their neighbor 's euphoria in supporting america .
poll numbers suggest that some 43 percent of the czechs would reject the stationing of u.s. troops in their country .
parliamentarians , such as the chair of the foreign affairs committee , also remain skeptical .
" i understand this future , but for us , for me , it 's a problem , a question , " vladimir lastuvka told deutsche welle in an interview .
u.s. : too early for such talk u.s. military leaders insist it 's too early for any talk of soldiers on czech soil .
military planners said the current discussion on the movement of some troops out of germany into eastern european countries is taking part as part of a long-term military reconfiguration .
speculation on the actual move and where it might bring u.s. troops is still premature , they say .
but that has n't stopped eastern european officials from advocating the merits of such a move .
" in the future where are the prevalent possible sources of conflict ?
it 's still the balkans , still the middle east .
we can talk about this movement of american bases as a step towards a higher efficiency for the future deployment of american forces , " deputy prime minister petr mares told deutsche welle .
the new nato member would stand to gain as well , with an american military base lending a feeling of protection and security to the country .
there are also the economic benefits american soldiers will bring to the country , benefits the german towns surrounding u.s. bases in ramstein and landstuhl have known for quite some time .

hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .
their route took them along the very road where the suicide car bombing took place only three days earlier .
attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .
question of more troops undecided despite the suicide bombing , germany ’ s defense minister has not altogether ruled out expanding the soldiers ’ area of deployment outside kabul .
a reconnaissance team of experts from the bundeswehr was sent to afghanistan on tuesday to explore the possibility of deploying german soldiers to other cities in afghanistan as part of an expanded isaf mission .
after the military experts return in two weeks , defense minister peter struck will present his decision to parliament , which must approve an expansion of the afghanistan mandate .
currently , germany has 2,400 troops stationed in kabul , making it the largest national contingent in the 5,000-strong isaf force .
germany also shares command of the international peacekeeping force with the netherlands .
an expansion of the german mission would require sending more troops to afghanistan , a move many in parliament are hesitant to make given the current instability in the region . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 4 germans killed in kabul suicide bombing five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan -lrb- june 7 , 2002 -rrb- .

attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .

their death serves as a reminder of the risks involved in the afghanistan mission . the sight was a somber one .
hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.06.2003 bracing for the german discount store revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers are getting carried away with discount stores aldi and lidl german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .
and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .
lidl has a strategy to widen its europe-wide presence but when questioned , sources at the company declined to elaborate .

and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .
lidl has a strategy to widen its europe-wide presence but when questioned , sources at the company declined to elaborate .
one thing is for sure ; the german discount store revolution is under way on a global scale . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german shopping trend mixes the great with the small despite germany 's trailing economy , and an increasing slump in retail sales , one sector of the retail industry is thriving : the small corner shop .

" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "
wallström criticized the tendency among some states to ban bathing or strike locations from lists of bathing sites in places that did not meet eu 's standards .

vacationers in europe will be relieved to know that most bathing waters in the eu are clean .
the seaside , in particular , is mainly free from pollution , a recent report on water quality shows . parents can send their offspring into the waves with a clear conscience this summer , since a report revealed the quality of bathing waters in most of the european union 's coasts and lakes was very high .
the continent 's most popular beach holiday destinations , greece , italy , portugal and spain , complied more than 96 percent with eu water quality directives , an eu study published late last week shows .
but germany and france did n't fulfill the regulations ; their water quality has decreased over the past few years .
the results compiled for 2002 showed that 95.8 percent of coastal sites and 91 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu 's compulsory standards , despite the torrential rains and floods that plagued central europe in august and september 2002 .
the report took account of samples analyzed in 13,627 coastal beaches and 5,773 freshwater areas " the impact of water quality on bathers is a clear demonstration of the linkages between environmental quality and human health , " eu environment commissioner margot wallström said while introducing the report .
" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "

instead , she said , states should deal with the causes of pollution .
poor results in germany , france germany scored lower than the previous year with 97.3 percent compliance for saltwater sites , two percent less than last year .

the drop was reportedly due to heavy rains and floods .

vacationers in europe will be relieved to know that most bathing waters in the eu are clean .
the seaside , in particular , is mainly free from pollution , a recent report on water quality shows . parents can send their offspring into the waves with a clear conscience this summer , since a report revealed the quality of bathing waters in most of the european union 's coasts and lakes was very high .
the continent 's most popular beach holiday destinations , greece , italy , portugal and spain , complied more than 96 percent with eu water quality directives , an eu study published late last week shows .
but germany and france did n't fulfill the regulations ; their water quality has decreased over the past few years .
the results compiled for 2002 showed that 95.8 percent of coastal sites and 91 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu 's compulsory standards , despite the torrential rains and floods that plagued central europe in august and september 2002 .
the report took account of samples analyzed in 13,627 coastal beaches and 5,773 freshwater areas " the impact of water quality on bathers is a clear demonstration of the linkages between environmental quality and human health , " eu environment commissioner margot wallström said while introducing the report .
" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "
wallström criticized the tendency among some states to ban bathing or strike locations from lists of bathing sites in places that did not meet eu 's standards .
instead , she said , states should deal with the causes of pollution .
poor results in germany , france germany scored lower than the previous year with 97.3 percent compliance for saltwater sites , two percent less than last year .
the situation was more dramatic in german lakes , which slid by six percentage points to 83 percent .
the drop was reportedly due to heavy rains and floods .
nonetheless , germany 's larger lakes like bodensee , chiemsee , schliersee and tegernsee , as well as all but two in berlin were declared safe .
in france compliance rates were among the lowest for all eu countries .
only 87.5 percent of coastal waters and 89.6 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu directive .
the netherlands , by contrast , displayed the eu 's highest standards , with 100 percent of all waters fully compliant .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.06.2003 bracing for the german discount store revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers are getting carried away with discount stores aldi and lidl german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .
and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .
lidl has a strategy to widen its europe-wide presence but when questioned , sources at the company declined to elaborate .

" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "

aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .

and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .

their death serves as a reminder of the risks involved in the afghanistan mission . the sight was a somber one .
hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .
their route took them along the very road where the suicide car bombing took place only three days earlier .
attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .
question of more troops undecided despite the suicide bombing , germany ’ s defense minister has not altogether ruled out expanding the soldiers ’ area of deployment outside kabul .
a reconnaissance team of experts from the bundeswehr was sent to afghanistan on tuesday to explore the possibility of deploying german soldiers to other cities in afghanistan as part of an expanded isaf mission .
after the military experts return in two weeks , defense minister peter struck will present his decision to parliament , which must approve an expansion of the afghanistan mandate .
currently , germany has 2,400 troops stationed in kabul , making it the largest national contingent in the 5,000-strong isaf force .
germany also shares command of the international peacekeeping force with the netherlands .
an expansion of the german mission would require sending more troops to afghanistan , a move many in parliament are hesitant to make given the current instability in the region . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 4 germans killed in kabul suicide bombing five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan -lrb- june 7 , 2002 -rrb- .

hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .

germany ’ s national railway operator deutsche bahn has already lost many long-distance customers to discount airlines .
but now the bahn ’ s railway rival connex has slowly begun expanding its own cross-country service . private rail company connex , a subsidiary of french conglomerate vivendi , began its third major german route on friday .
two interconnex trains will travel from rostock to cologne via berlin in either direction once daily .
the 912 kilometer-stretch from the baltic sea port to the metropolis on the rhine river will be the operator ’ s first long-distance service .
though the connex service is infrequent and slow – the trip from rostock to cologne takes 12 hours – it could prove to be stiff competition for the beleaguered deutsche bahn if it is deemed a success .
despite running a railway network that would be the envy of many countries , deutsche bahn has come in for heavy criticism for being inefficient , expensive and inflexible .
it ’ s new pricing system introduced late last year was so hated by passengers , that half a year later the former state-run rail operator was embarrassingly forced to admit the initiative had been a disaster .
in an attempt to get travelers to commit themselves to taking the train , the bahn in december instituted a system that rewarded those who booked early with cheaper prices .
but the scheme backfired by overlooking one of the most attractive aspects of train travel – it ’ s spontaneity .
tickets on some heavily-traveled routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spur-of-the-moment , business and tourist travelers particularly hard .
new approach to attract customers , connex has taken a completely opposite approach .
with fixed fees at significantly lower levels than deutsche bahn – cologne to rostock will cost € 50 – connex also allows passengers to buy their tickets on board at no extra charge .
its motto is " climb aboard and go ! "
" the deutsche bahn has cut many regional direct connections , " said joachim kemnitz , a spokesman for the rail travel passenger association pro bahn , according to german news agency dpa .
" that connex is trying to fill gaps in service is being well received by customers , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex boss hans leister told ndr public television that the company ’ s success on its two previous shorter routes in eastern germany had convinced management to slowly expand its service into a nationwide long-distance network .
though deutsche bahn was originally happy to see connex step in where it could no longer offer cost-effective regional service , a rival nationwide network could undercut the bahn just as it is competing with discounted airlines for customers .
bahn spokesman uwe herz said last week that the cheap air carriers were costing deutsche bahn approximately € 80 million a year .
as an example , he cited the cologne-hamburg business service , which has lost a quarter of its passengers since discounted airfares had become available .

european justice ministers have agreed to sign a deal that will increase already close cooperation with the united states in the fight against terrorism . a legal cooperation deal between the european union and the united states worked out in secret over the past year is due to be signed in the coming weeks . in an effort to smooth cooperation between the two sides , the pact , which has been under negotiation by justice and home affairs ministers in the 15-member union since the summer , will replace bilateral agreements currently in effect between the united states and countries like germany and britain . officials on both sides of the atlantic praised what is being seen as a shining example of cooperation in one of the few areas where europe and the united states work together in harmony . the greek justice minister , presiding over the meeting of ministers on friday , called the agreement " a step forward . " u.s. officials , already satisfied with anti-terror efforts in europe , were also pleased with the decision . eu wrangles option on extradition the pact dictates closer cooperation on fronts such as mutual legal assistance and the exchange of banking information .
the stickiest issue , extradition , was laid aside after european union states won a clause from the u.s. allowing them to refuse to extradite a suspect who could face the death penalty . eu states are signatories of the european convention on human rights which outlaws the death penalty .
the convention also prohibits any extradition deal that could lead to their citizens facing the death penalty , which is legal in the united states . the issue has been a difficult one for both sides to iron out .
last year , france and germany initially refused to hand over legal documents that u.s. prosecutors wanted to use in the prosecution of french citizen and suspected terrorist-cell member zacarias moussaoui . the two countries later agreed to release the documents . reaction is critical during a meeting with european commission president roman prodi last october , u.s. president george w. bush included the extradition issue on a u.s. wish list . questions remain over a number of other issues , such as the status of suspected taliban and al qaeda fighters held prisoner on guantanamo bay . the european parliament joined human rights organizations such as amnesty international and statewatch in criticizing the deal .
parliamentarians adopted a resolution this week stating that it was " paradoxical to sign an agreement with the united states when several european union citizens are still being held at … guantanamo bay , quite unlawfully .

the possibility of u.s. military bases in western europe moving east to nato members like the czech republic has sparked a debate in a country still getting over decades of soviet occupation . the last foreign troops based in the czech republic swore allegiance to the ussr .
when the 75,000 soviet soldiers left the country following the collapse of the iron curtain in the early 1990s , many in the czech republic hoped it was the last time soldiers under a foreign flag would set up shop on their home soil .
now , there 's very serious talk in the pentagon of relocating u.s. bases in western europe east to countries like poland and the czech republic - and the country finds itself in the middle of a hot debate .
czechs " are very touchy when it comes to foreign soldiers on our territory .
the renewed stationing of foreign troops would probably not be welcome , " said czech president vaclav klaus in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung last month .
czechs more skeptical than poles the remarks unleashed hefty discussion within the government and parliament .
though government officials largely supported the war against saddam hussein , they stopped short of committing any military personnel , like poland .
there are other signs to indicate they do not share their neighbor 's euphoria in supporting america .
poll numbers suggest that some 43 percent of the czechs would reject the stationing of u.s. troops in their country .
parliamentarians , such as the chair of the foreign affairs committee , also remain skeptical .
" i understand this future , but for us , for me , it 's a problem , a question , " vladimir lastuvka told deutsche welle in an interview .
u.s. : too early for such talk u.s. military leaders insist it 's too early for any talk of soldiers on czech soil .
military planners said the current discussion on the movement of some troops out of germany into eastern european countries is taking part as part of a long-term military reconfiguration .
speculation on the actual move and where it might bring u.s. troops is still premature , they say .
but that has n't stopped eastern european officials from advocating the merits of such a move .
" in the future where are the prevalent possible sources of conflict ?
it 's still the balkans , still the middle east .
we can talk about this movement of american bases as a step towards a higher efficiency for the future deployment of american forces , " deputy prime minister petr mares told deutsche welle .
the new nato member would stand to gain as well , with an american military base lending a feeling of protection and security to the country .
there are also the economic benefits american soldiers will bring to the country , benefits the german towns surrounding u.s. bases in ramstein and landstuhl have known for quite some time .

the new nato member would stand to gain as well , with an american military base lending a feeling of protection and security to the country .
there are also the economic benefits american soldiers will bring to the country , benefits the german towns surrounding u.s. bases in ramstein and landstuhl have known for quite some time .
" i think that it 's maybe a good idea , because american soldiers are professional , " said one czech man in an on-the-street interview with deutsche welle .

" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "
wallström criticized the tendency among some states to ban bathing or strike locations from lists of bathing sites in places that did not meet eu 's standards .
instead , she said , states should deal with the causes of pollution .
poor results in germany , france germany scored lower than the previous year with 97.3 percent compliance for saltwater sites , two percent less than last year .

the drop was reportedly due to heavy rains and floods .

last year , france and germany initially refused to hand over legal documents that u.s. prosecutors wanted to use in the prosecution of french citizen and suspected terrorist-cell member zacarias moussaoui . the two countries later agreed to release the documents . reaction is critical during a meeting with european commission president roman prodi last october , u.s. president george w. bush included the extradition issue on a u.s. wish list . questions remain over a number of other issues , such as the status of suspected taliban and al qaeda fighters held prisoner on guantanamo bay . the european parliament joined human rights organizations such as amnesty international and statewatch in criticizing the deal .
parliamentarians adopted a resolution this week stating that it was " paradoxical to sign an agreement with the united states when several european union citizens are still being held at … guantanamo bay , quite unlawfully .

the possibility of u.s. military bases in western europe moving east to nato members like the czech republic has sparked a debate in a country still getting over decades of soviet occupation . the last foreign troops based in the czech republic swore allegiance to the ussr .
when the 75,000 soviet soldiers left the country following the collapse of the iron curtain in the early 1990s , many in the czech republic hoped it was the last time soldiers under a foreign flag would set up shop on their home soil .
now , there 's very serious talk in the pentagon of relocating u.s. bases in western europe east to countries like poland and the czech republic - and the country finds itself in the middle of a hot debate .
czechs " are very touchy when it comes to foreign soldiers on our territory .
the renewed stationing of foreign troops would probably not be welcome , " said czech president vaclav klaus in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung last month .
czechs more skeptical than poles the remarks unleashed hefty discussion within the government and parliament .
though government officials largely supported the war against saddam hussein , they stopped short of committing any military personnel , like poland .
there are other signs to indicate they do not share their neighbor 's euphoria in supporting america .
poll numbers suggest that some 43 percent of the czechs would reject the stationing of u.s. troops in their country .
parliamentarians , such as the chair of the foreign affairs committee , also remain skeptical .
" i understand this future , but for us , for me , it 's a problem , a question , " vladimir lastuvka told deutsche welle in an interview .
u.s. : too early for such talk u.s. military leaders insist it 's too early for any talk of soldiers on czech soil .
military planners said the current discussion on the movement of some troops out of germany into eastern european countries is taking part as part of a long-term military reconfiguration .
speculation on the actual move and where it might bring u.s. troops is still premature , they say .
but that has n't stopped eastern european officials from advocating the merits of such a move .

germany ’ s national railway operator deutsche bahn has already lost many long-distance customers to discount airlines .
but now the bahn ’ s railway rival connex has slowly begun expanding its own cross-country service . private rail company connex , a subsidiary of french conglomerate vivendi , began its third major german route on friday .
two interconnex trains will travel from rostock to cologne via berlin in either direction once daily .
the 912 kilometer-stretch from the baltic sea port to the metropolis on the rhine river will be the operator ’ s first long-distance service .
though the connex service is infrequent and slow – the trip from rostock to cologne takes 12 hours – it could prove to be stiff competition for the beleaguered deutsche bahn if it is deemed a success .
despite running a railway network that would be the envy of many countries , deutsche bahn has come in for heavy criticism for being inefficient , expensive and inflexible .
it ’ s new pricing system introduced late last year was so hated by passengers , that half a year later the former state-run rail operator was embarrassingly forced to admit the initiative had been a disaster .
in an attempt to get travelers to commit themselves to taking the train , the bahn in december instituted a system that rewarded those who booked early with cheaper prices .
but the scheme backfired by overlooking one of the most attractive aspects of train travel – it ’ s spontaneity .
tickets on some heavily-traveled routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spur-of-the-moment , business and tourist travelers particularly hard .
new approach to attract customers , connex has taken a completely opposite approach .
with fixed fees at significantly lower levels than deutsche bahn – cologne to rostock will cost € 50 – connex also allows passengers to buy their tickets on board at no extra charge .
its motto is " climb aboard and go ! "
" the deutsche bahn has cut many regional direct connections , " said joachim kemnitz , a spokesman for the rail travel passenger association pro bahn , according to german news agency dpa .
" that connex is trying to fill gaps in service is being well received by customers , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex boss hans leister told ndr public television that the company ’ s success on its two previous shorter routes in eastern germany had convinced management to slowly expand its service into a nationwide long-distance network .
though deutsche bahn was originally happy to see connex step in where it could no longer offer cost-effective regional service , a rival nationwide network could undercut the bahn just as it is competing with discounted airlines for customers .
bahn spokesman uwe herz said last week that the cheap air carriers were costing deutsche bahn approximately € 80 million a year .
as an example , he cited the cologne-hamburg business service , which has lost a quarter of its passengers since discounted airfares had become available .
" customers will only be convinced to travel by rail with alternative offers and attractive prices , " said connex ’ s leister . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn reforms new price system following months of criticism and heavy losses , germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn , is rolling back some of the most controversial elements of the new price system - more changes are expected by year 's end .

vacationers in europe will be relieved to know that most bathing waters in the eu are clean .
the seaside , in particular , is mainly free from pollution , a recent report on water quality shows . parents can send their offspring into the waves with a clear conscience this summer , since a report revealed the quality of bathing waters in most of the european union 's coasts and lakes was very high .
the continent 's most popular beach holiday destinations , greece , italy , portugal and spain , complied more than 96 percent with eu water quality directives , an eu study published late last week shows .
but germany and france did n't fulfill the regulations ; their water quality has decreased over the past few years .
the results compiled for 2002 showed that 95.8 percent of coastal sites and 91 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu 's compulsory standards , despite the torrential rains and floods that plagued central europe in august and september 2002 .
the report took account of samples analyzed in 13,627 coastal beaches and 5,773 freshwater areas " the impact of water quality on bathers is a clear demonstration of the linkages between environmental quality and human health , " eu environment commissioner margot wallström said while introducing the report .
" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "
wallström criticized the tendency among some states to ban bathing or strike locations from lists of bathing sites in places that did not meet eu 's standards .
instead , she said , states should deal with the causes of pollution .
poor results in germany , france germany scored lower than the previous year with 97.3 percent compliance for saltwater sites , two percent less than last year .
the situation was more dramatic in german lakes , which slid by six percentage points to 83 percent .
the drop was reportedly due to heavy rains and floods .
nonetheless , germany 's larger lakes like bodensee , chiemsee , schliersee and tegernsee , as well as all but two in berlin were declared safe .
in france compliance rates were among the lowest for all eu countries .
only 87.5 percent of coastal waters and 89.6 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu directive .
the netherlands , by contrast , displayed the eu 's highest standards , with 100 percent of all waters fully compliant .
the bathing water directive established in 1976 looks mainly at fecal contamination and whether the water looks appealing to swim in .

germany ’ s national railway operator deutsche bahn has already lost many long-distance customers to discount airlines .
but now the bahn ’ s railway rival connex has slowly begun expanding its own cross-country service . private rail company connex , a subsidiary of french conglomerate vivendi , began its third major german route on friday .
two interconnex trains will travel from rostock to cologne via berlin in either direction once daily .
the 912 kilometer-stretch from the baltic sea port to the metropolis on the rhine river will be the operator ’ s first long-distance service .
though the connex service is infrequent and slow – the trip from rostock to cologne takes 12 hours – it could prove to be stiff competition for the beleaguered deutsche bahn if it is deemed a success .
despite running a railway network that would be the envy of many countries , deutsche bahn has come in for heavy criticism for being inefficient , expensive and inflexible .
it ’ s new pricing system introduced late last year was so hated by passengers , that half a year later the former state-run rail operator was embarrassingly forced to admit the initiative had been a disaster .
in an attempt to get travelers to commit themselves to taking the train , the bahn in december instituted a system that rewarded those who booked early with cheaper prices .
but the scheme backfired by overlooking one of the most attractive aspects of train travel – it ’ s spontaneity .
tickets on some heavily-traveled routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spur-of-the-moment , business and tourist travelers particularly hard .
new approach to attract customers , connex has taken a completely opposite approach .
with fixed fees at significantly lower levels than deutsche bahn – cologne to rostock will cost € 50 – connex also allows passengers to buy their tickets on board at no extra charge .
its motto is " climb aboard and go ! "
" the deutsche bahn has cut many regional direct connections , " said joachim kemnitz , a spokesman for the rail travel passenger association pro bahn , according to german news agency dpa .
" that connex is trying to fill gaps in service is being well received by customers , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex boss hans leister told ndr public television that the company ’ s success on its two previous shorter routes in eastern germany had convinced management to slowly expand its service into a nationwide long-distance network .

germany ’ s national railway operator deutsche bahn has already lost many long-distance customers to discount airlines .
but now the bahn ’ s railway rival connex has slowly begun expanding its own cross-country service . private rail company connex , a subsidiary of french conglomerate vivendi , began its third major german route on friday .
two interconnex trains will travel from rostock to cologne via berlin in either direction once daily .
the 912 kilometer-stretch from the baltic sea port to the metropolis on the rhine river will be the operator ’ s first long-distance service .
though the connex service is infrequent and slow – the trip from rostock to cologne takes 12 hours – it could prove to be stiff competition for the beleaguered deutsche bahn if it is deemed a success .
despite running a railway network that would be the envy of many countries , deutsche bahn has come in for heavy criticism for being inefficient , expensive and inflexible .
it ’ s new pricing system introduced late last year was so hated by passengers , that half a year later the former state-run rail operator was embarrassingly forced to admit the initiative had been a disaster .
in an attempt to get travelers to commit themselves to taking the train , the bahn in december instituted a system that rewarded those who booked early with cheaper prices .
but the scheme backfired by overlooking one of the most attractive aspects of train travel – it ’ s spontaneity .
tickets on some heavily-traveled routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spur-of-the-moment , business and tourist travelers particularly hard .
new approach to attract customers , connex has taken a completely opposite approach .
with fixed fees at significantly lower levels than deutsche bahn – cologne to rostock will cost € 50 – connex also allows passengers to buy their tickets on board at no extra charge .
its motto is " climb aboard and go ! "
" the deutsche bahn has cut many regional direct connections , " said joachim kemnitz , a spokesman for the rail travel passenger association pro bahn , according to german news agency dpa .
" that connex is trying to fill gaps in service is being well received by customers , " he said .

their death serves as a reminder of the risks involved in the afghanistan mission . the sight was a somber one .
hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .
their route took them along the very road where the suicide car bombing took place only three days earlier .
attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .
question of more troops undecided despite the suicide bombing , germany ’ s defense minister has not altogether ruled out expanding the soldiers ’ area of deployment outside kabul .
a reconnaissance team of experts from the bundeswehr was sent to afghanistan on tuesday to explore the possibility of deploying german soldiers to other cities in afghanistan as part of an expanded isaf mission .
after the military experts return in two weeks , defense minister peter struck will present his decision to parliament , which must approve an expansion of the afghanistan mandate .
currently , germany has 2,400 troops stationed in kabul , making it the largest national contingent in the 5,000-strong isaf force .
germany also shares command of the international peacekeeping force with the netherlands .

their death serves as a reminder of the risks involved in the afghanistan mission . the sight was a somber one .
hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .
their route took them along the very road where the suicide car bombing took place only three days earlier .
attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.06.2003 bracing for the german discount store revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers are getting carried away with discount stores aldi and lidl german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .
and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .
lidl has a strategy to widen its europe-wide presence but when questioned , sources at the company declined to elaborate .

feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .
lidl has a strategy to widen its europe-wide presence but when questioned , sources at the company declined to elaborate .

and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .

vacationers in europe will be relieved to know that most bathing waters in the eu are clean .
the seaside , in particular , is mainly free from pollution , a recent report on water quality shows . parents can send their offspring into the waves with a clear conscience this summer , since a report revealed the quality of bathing waters in most of the european union 's coasts and lakes was very high .
the continent 's most popular beach holiday destinations , greece , italy , portugal and spain , complied more than 96 percent with eu water quality directives , an eu study published late last week shows .
but germany and france did n't fulfill the regulations ; their water quality has decreased over the past few years .
the results compiled for 2002 showed that 95.8 percent of coastal sites and 91 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu 's compulsory standards , despite the torrential rains and floods that plagued central europe in august and september 2002 .
the report took account of samples analyzed in 13,627 coastal beaches and 5,773 freshwater areas " the impact of water quality on bathers is a clear demonstration of the linkages between environmental quality and human health , " eu environment commissioner margot wallström said while introducing the report .
" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "
wallström criticized the tendency among some states to ban bathing or strike locations from lists of bathing sites in places that did not meet eu 's standards .
instead , she said , states should deal with the causes of pollution .
poor results in germany , france germany scored lower than the previous year with 97.3 percent compliance for saltwater sites , two percent less than last year .
the situation was more dramatic in german lakes , which slid by six percentage points to 83 percent .
the drop was reportedly due to heavy rains and floods .
nonetheless , germany 's larger lakes like bodensee , chiemsee , schliersee and tegernsee , as well as all but two in berlin were declared safe .
in france compliance rates were among the lowest for all eu countries .
only 87.5 percent of coastal waters and 89.6 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu directive .
the netherlands , by contrast , displayed the eu 's highest standards , with 100 percent of all waters fully compliant .
the bathing water directive established in 1976 looks mainly at fecal contamination and whether the water looks appealing to swim in .

" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "
wallström criticized the tendency among some states to ban bathing or strike locations from lists of bathing sites in places that did not meet eu 's standards .
instead , she said , states should deal with the causes of pollution .
poor results in germany , france germany scored lower than the previous year with 97.3 percent compliance for saltwater sites , two percent less than last year .
the situation was more dramatic in german lakes , which slid by six percentage points to 83 percent .
the drop was reportedly due to heavy rains and floods .
nonetheless , germany 's larger lakes like bodensee , chiemsee , schliersee and tegernsee , as well as all but two in berlin were declared safe .
in france compliance rates were among the lowest for all eu countries .
only 87.5 percent of coastal waters and 89.6 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu directive .
the netherlands , by contrast , displayed the eu 's highest standards , with 100 percent of all waters fully compliant .
the bathing water directive established in 1976 looks mainly at fecal contamination and whether the water looks appealing to swim in .
samples are supposed to be taken every two weeks as well as a fortnight before the local bathing season begins . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european forests thriving in high ozone areas growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving .

the possibility of u.s. military bases in western europe moving east to nato members like the czech republic has sparked a debate in a country still getting over decades of soviet occupation . the last foreign troops based in the czech republic swore allegiance to the ussr .
when the 75,000 soviet soldiers left the country following the collapse of the iron curtain in the early 1990s , many in the czech republic hoped it was the last time soldiers under a foreign flag would set up shop on their home soil .
now , there 's very serious talk in the pentagon of relocating u.s. bases in western europe east to countries like poland and the czech republic - and the country finds itself in the middle of a hot debate .
czechs " are very touchy when it comes to foreign soldiers on our territory .
the renewed stationing of foreign troops would probably not be welcome , " said czech president vaclav klaus in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung last month .
czechs more skeptical than poles the remarks unleashed hefty discussion within the government and parliament .
though government officials largely supported the war against saddam hussein , they stopped short of committing any military personnel , like poland .
there are other signs to indicate they do not share their neighbor 's euphoria in supporting america .
poll numbers suggest that some 43 percent of the czechs would reject the stationing of u.s. troops in their country .
parliamentarians , such as the chair of the foreign affairs committee , also remain skeptical .
" i understand this future , but for us , for me , it 's a problem , a question , " vladimir lastuvka told deutsche welle in an interview .
u.s. : too early for such talk u.s. military leaders insist it 's too early for any talk of soldiers on czech soil .
military planners said the current discussion on the movement of some troops out of germany into eastern european countries is taking part as part of a long-term military reconfiguration .
speculation on the actual move and where it might bring u.s. troops is still premature , they say .
but that has n't stopped eastern european officials from advocating the merits of such a move .

hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .
their route took them along the very road where the suicide car bombing took place only three days earlier .
attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .
question of more troops undecided despite the suicide bombing , germany ’ s defense minister has not altogether ruled out expanding the soldiers ’ area of deployment outside kabul .
a reconnaissance team of experts from the bundeswehr was sent to afghanistan on tuesday to explore the possibility of deploying german soldiers to other cities in afghanistan as part of an expanded isaf mission .
after the military experts return in two weeks , defense minister peter struck will present his decision to parliament , which must approve an expansion of the afghanistan mandate .
currently , germany has 2,400 troops stationed in kabul , making it the largest national contingent in the 5,000-strong isaf force .

their death serves as a reminder of the risks involved in the afghanistan mission . the sight was a somber one .
hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .
their route took them along the very road where the suicide car bombing took place only three days earlier .
attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.06.2003 bracing for the german discount store revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers are getting carried away with discount stores aldi and lidl german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .
and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .
lidl has a strategy to widen its europe-wide presence but when questioned , sources at the company declined to elaborate .
one thing is for sure ; the german discount store revolution is under way on a global scale . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german shopping trend mixes the great with the small despite germany 's trailing economy , and an increasing slump in retail sales , one sector of the retail industry is thriving : the small corner shop .
german shoppers are setting a new trend - so-called " hybrid " shopping .

germany ’ s national railway operator deutsche bahn has already lost many long-distance customers to discount airlines .
but now the bahn ’ s railway rival connex has slowly begun expanding its own cross-country service . private rail company connex , a subsidiary of french conglomerate vivendi , began its third major german route on friday .
two interconnex trains will travel from rostock to cologne via berlin in either direction once daily .
the 912 kilometer-stretch from the baltic sea port to the metropolis on the rhine river will be the operator ’ s first long-distance service .
though the connex service is infrequent and slow – the trip from rostock to cologne takes 12 hours – it could prove to be stiff competition for the beleaguered deutsche bahn if it is deemed a success .
despite running a railway network that would be the envy of many countries , deutsche bahn has come in for heavy criticism for being inefficient , expensive and inflexible .
it ’ s new pricing system introduced late last year was so hated by passengers , that half a year later the former state-run rail operator was embarrassingly forced to admit the initiative had been a disaster .
in an attempt to get travelers to commit themselves to taking the train , the bahn in december instituted a system that rewarded those who booked early with cheaper prices .
but the scheme backfired by overlooking one of the most attractive aspects of train travel – it ’ s spontaneity .
tickets on some heavily-traveled routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spur-of-the-moment , business and tourist travelers particularly hard .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex boss hans leister told ndr public television that the company ’ s success on its two previous shorter routes in eastern germany had convinced management to slowly expand its service into a nationwide long-distance network .
though deutsche bahn was originally happy to see connex step in where it could no longer offer cost-effective regional service , a rival nationwide network could undercut the bahn just as it is competing with discounted airlines for customers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.06.2003 bracing for the german discount store revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers are getting carried away with discount stores aldi and lidl german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .
and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .

the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.06.2003 bracing for the german discount store revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers are getting carried away with discount stores aldi and lidl german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .
and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .

and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.06.2003 bracing for the german discount store revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers are getting carried away with discount stores aldi and lidl german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .
and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .
lidl has a strategy to widen its europe-wide presence but when questioned , sources at the company declined to elaborate .

their death serves as a reminder of the risks involved in the afghanistan mission . the sight was a somber one .
hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .
their route took them along the very road where the suicide car bombing took place only three days earlier .
attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .
question of more troops undecided despite the suicide bombing , germany ’ s defense minister has not altogether ruled out expanding the soldiers ’ area of deployment outside kabul .
a reconnaissance team of experts from the bundeswehr was sent to afghanistan on tuesday to explore the possibility of deploying german soldiers to other cities in afghanistan as part of an expanded isaf mission .
after the military experts return in two weeks , defense minister peter struck will present his decision to parliament , which must approve an expansion of the afghanistan mandate .
currently , germany has 2,400 troops stationed in kabul , making it the largest national contingent in the 5,000-strong isaf force .
germany also shares command of the international peacekeeping force with the netherlands .
an expansion of the german mission would require sending more troops to afghanistan , a move many in parliament are hesitant to make given the current instability in the region . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 4 germans killed in kabul suicide bombing five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan -lrb- june 7 , 2002 -rrb- .

widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .

and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .

their death serves as a reminder of the risks involved in the afghanistan mission . the sight was a somber one .
hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .
their route took them along the very road where the suicide car bombing took place only three days earlier .
attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .
question of more troops undecided despite the suicide bombing , germany ’ s defense minister has not altogether ruled out expanding the soldiers ’ area of deployment outside kabul .
a reconnaissance team of experts from the bundeswehr was sent to afghanistan on tuesday to explore the possibility of deploying german soldiers to other cities in afghanistan as part of an expanded isaf mission .
after the military experts return in two weeks , defense minister peter struck will present his decision to parliament , which must approve an expansion of the afghanistan mandate .
currently , germany has 2,400 troops stationed in kabul , making it the largest national contingent in the 5,000-strong isaf force .
germany also shares command of the international peacekeeping force with the netherlands .
an expansion of the german mission would require sending more troops to afghanistan , a move many in parliament are hesitant to make given the current instability in the region . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 4 germans killed in kabul suicide bombing five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan -lrb- june 7 , 2002 -rrb- .

the possibility of u.s. military bases in western europe moving east to nato members like the czech republic has sparked a debate in a country still getting over decades of soviet occupation . the last foreign troops based in the czech republic swore allegiance to the ussr .
when the 75,000 soviet soldiers left the country following the collapse of the iron curtain in the early 1990s , many in the czech republic hoped it was the last time soldiers under a foreign flag would set up shop on their home soil .
now , there 's very serious talk in the pentagon of relocating u.s. bases in western europe east to countries like poland and the czech republic - and the country finds itself in the middle of a hot debate .
czechs " are very touchy when it comes to foreign soldiers on our territory .
the renewed stationing of foreign troops would probably not be welcome , " said czech president vaclav klaus in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung last month .
czechs more skeptical than poles the remarks unleashed hefty discussion within the government and parliament .
though government officials largely supported the war against saddam hussein , they stopped short of committing any military personnel , like poland .
there are other signs to indicate they do not share their neighbor 's euphoria in supporting america .
poll numbers suggest that some 43 percent of the czechs would reject the stationing of u.s. troops in their country .
parliamentarians , such as the chair of the foreign affairs committee , also remain skeptical .
" i understand this future , but for us , for me , it 's a problem , a question , " vladimir lastuvka told deutsche welle in an interview .
u.s. : too early for such talk u.s. military leaders insist it 's too early for any talk of soldiers on czech soil .
military planners said the current discussion on the movement of some troops out of germany into eastern european countries is taking part as part of a long-term military reconfiguration .
speculation on the actual move and where it might bring u.s. troops is still premature , they say .
but that has n't stopped eastern european officials from advocating the merits of such a move .
" in the future where are the prevalent possible sources of conflict ?
it 's still the balkans , still the middle east .
we can talk about this movement of american bases as a step towards a higher efficiency for the future deployment of american forces , " deputy prime minister petr mares told deutsche welle .
the new nato member would stand to gain as well , with an american military base lending a feeling of protection and security to the country .
there are also the economic benefits american soldiers will bring to the country , benefits the german towns surrounding u.s. bases in ramstein and landstuhl have known for quite some time .

their death serves as a reminder of the risks involved in the afghanistan mission . the sight was a somber one .
hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .
their route took them along the very road where the suicide car bombing took place only three days earlier .
attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .
question of more troops undecided despite the suicide bombing , germany ’ s defense minister has not altogether ruled out expanding the soldiers ’ area of deployment outside kabul .
a reconnaissance team of experts from the bundeswehr was sent to afghanistan on tuesday to explore the possibility of deploying german soldiers to other cities in afghanistan as part of an expanded isaf mission .
after the military experts return in two weeks , defense minister peter struck will present his decision to parliament , which must approve an expansion of the afghanistan mandate .
currently , germany has 2,400 troops stationed in kabul , making it the largest national contingent in the 5,000-strong isaf force .
germany also shares command of the international peacekeeping force with the netherlands .
an expansion of the german mission would require sending more troops to afghanistan , a move many in parliament are hesitant to make given the current instability in the region . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 4 germans killed in kabul suicide bombing five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan -lrb- june 7 , 2002 -rrb- .

germany ’ s national railway operator deutsche bahn has already lost many long-distance customers to discount airlines .
but now the bahn ’ s railway rival connex has slowly begun expanding its own cross-country service . private rail company connex , a subsidiary of french conglomerate vivendi , began its third major german route on friday .
two interconnex trains will travel from rostock to cologne via berlin in either direction once daily .
the 912 kilometer-stretch from the baltic sea port to the metropolis on the rhine river will be the operator ’ s first long-distance service .
though the connex service is infrequent and slow – the trip from rostock to cologne takes 12 hours – it could prove to be stiff competition for the beleaguered deutsche bahn if it is deemed a success .
despite running a railway network that would be the envy of many countries , deutsche bahn has come in for heavy criticism for being inefficient , expensive and inflexible .
it ’ s new pricing system introduced late last year was so hated by passengers , that half a year later the former state-run rail operator was embarrassingly forced to admit the initiative had been a disaster .
in an attempt to get travelers to commit themselves to taking the train , the bahn in december instituted a system that rewarded those who booked early with cheaper prices .
but the scheme backfired by overlooking one of the most attractive aspects of train travel – it ’ s spontaneity .
tickets on some heavily-traveled routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spur-of-the-moment , business and tourist travelers particularly hard .
new approach to attract customers , connex has taken a completely opposite approach .
with fixed fees at significantly lower levels than deutsche bahn – cologne to rostock will cost € 50 – connex also allows passengers to buy their tickets on board at no extra charge .
its motto is " climb aboard and go ! "
" the deutsche bahn has cut many regional direct connections , " said joachim kemnitz , a spokesman for the rail travel passenger association pro bahn , according to german news agency dpa .
" that connex is trying to fill gaps in service is being well received by customers , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex boss hans leister told ndr public television that the company ’ s success on its two previous shorter routes in eastern germany had convinced management to slowly expand its service into a nationwide long-distance network .
though deutsche bahn was originally happy to see connex step in where it could no longer offer cost-effective regional service , a rival nationwide network could undercut the bahn just as it is competing with discounted airlines for customers .
bahn spokesman uwe herz said last week that the cheap air carriers were costing deutsche bahn approximately € 80 million a year .
as an example , he cited the cologne-hamburg business service , which has lost a quarter of its passengers since discounted airfares had become available .
" customers will only be convinced to travel by rail with alternative offers and attractive prices , " said connex ’ s leister . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn reforms new price system following months of criticism and heavy losses , germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn , is rolling back some of the most controversial elements of the new price system - more changes are expected by year 's end .

vacationers in europe will be relieved to know that most bathing waters in the eu are clean .
the seaside , in particular , is mainly free from pollution , a recent report on water quality shows . parents can send their offspring into the waves with a clear conscience this summer , since a report revealed the quality of bathing waters in most of the european union 's coasts and lakes was very high .
the continent 's most popular beach holiday destinations , greece , italy , portugal and spain , complied more than 96 percent with eu water quality directives , an eu study published late last week shows .
but germany and france did n't fulfill the regulations ; their water quality has decreased over the past few years .
the results compiled for 2002 showed that 95.8 percent of coastal sites and 91 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu 's compulsory standards , despite the torrential rains and floods that plagued central europe in august and september 2002 .
the report took account of samples analyzed in 13,627 coastal beaches and 5,773 freshwater areas " the impact of water quality on bathers is a clear demonstration of the linkages between environmental quality and human health , " eu environment commissioner margot wallström said while introducing the report .
" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "
wallström criticized the tendency among some states to ban bathing or strike locations from lists of bathing sites in places that did not meet eu 's standards .
instead , she said , states should deal with the causes of pollution .
poor results in germany , france germany scored lower than the previous year with 97.3 percent compliance for saltwater sites , two percent less than last year .
the situation was more dramatic in german lakes , which slid by six percentage points to 83 percent .
the drop was reportedly due to heavy rains and floods .
nonetheless , germany 's larger lakes like bodensee , chiemsee , schliersee and tegernsee , as well as all but two in berlin were declared safe .
in france compliance rates were among the lowest for all eu countries .
only 87.5 percent of coastal waters and 89.6 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu directive .
the netherlands , by contrast , displayed the eu 's highest standards , with 100 percent of all waters fully compliant .
the bathing water directive established in 1976 looks mainly at fecal contamination and whether the water looks appealing to swim in .
samples are supposed to be taken every two weeks as well as a fortnight before the local bathing season begins . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european forests thriving in high ozone areas growing fears that pollution is damaging european forests beyond repair may have been ungrounded , according to research showing that wooded areas are actually thriving .

vacationers in europe will be relieved to know that most bathing waters in the eu are clean .
the seaside , in particular , is mainly free from pollution , a recent report on water quality shows . parents can send their offspring into the waves with a clear conscience this summer , since a report revealed the quality of bathing waters in most of the european union 's coasts and lakes was very high .
the continent 's most popular beach holiday destinations , greece , italy , portugal and spain , complied more than 96 percent with eu water quality directives , an eu study published late last week shows .
but germany and france did n't fulfill the regulations ; their water quality has decreased over the past few years .
the results compiled for 2002 showed that 95.8 percent of coastal sites and 91 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu 's compulsory standards , despite the torrential rains and floods that plagued central europe in august and september 2002 .
the report took account of samples analyzed in 13,627 coastal beaches and 5,773 freshwater areas " the impact of water quality on bathers is a clear demonstration of the linkages between environmental quality and human health , " eu environment commissioner margot wallström said while introducing the report .
" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "
wallström criticized the tendency among some states to ban bathing or strike locations from lists of bathing sites in places that did not meet eu 's standards .
instead , she said , states should deal with the causes of pollution .
poor results in germany , france germany scored lower than the previous year with 97.3 percent compliance for saltwater sites , two percent less than last year .
the situation was more dramatic in german lakes , which slid by six percentage points to 83 percent .
the drop was reportedly due to heavy rains and floods .
nonetheless , germany 's larger lakes like bodensee , chiemsee , schliersee and tegernsee , as well as all but two in berlin were declared safe .
in france compliance rates were among the lowest for all eu countries .
only 87.5 percent of coastal waters and 89.6 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu directive .
the netherlands , by contrast , displayed the eu 's highest standards , with 100 percent of all waters fully compliant .

vacationers in europe will be relieved to know that most bathing waters in the eu are clean .
the seaside , in particular , is mainly free from pollution , a recent report on water quality shows . parents can send their offspring into the waves with a clear conscience this summer , since a report revealed the quality of bathing waters in most of the european union 's coasts and lakes was very high .
the continent 's most popular beach holiday destinations , greece , italy , portugal and spain , complied more than 96 percent with eu water quality directives , an eu study published late last week shows .
but germany and france did n't fulfill the regulations ; their water quality has decreased over the past few years .
the results compiled for 2002 showed that 95.8 percent of coastal sites and 91 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu 's compulsory standards , despite the torrential rains and floods that plagued central europe in august and september 2002 .
the report took account of samples analyzed in 13,627 coastal beaches and 5,773 freshwater areas " the impact of water quality on bathers is a clear demonstration of the linkages between environmental quality and human health , " eu environment commissioner margot wallström said while introducing the report .
" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "
wallström criticized the tendency among some states to ban bathing or strike locations from lists of bathing sites in places that did not meet eu 's standards .
instead , she said , states should deal with the causes of pollution .
poor results in germany , france germany scored lower than the previous year with 97.3 percent compliance for saltwater sites , two percent less than last year .
the situation was more dramatic in german lakes , which slid by six percentage points to 83 percent .
the drop was reportedly due to heavy rains and floods .
nonetheless , germany 's larger lakes like bodensee , chiemsee , schliersee and tegernsee , as well as all but two in berlin were declared safe .
in france compliance rates were among the lowest for all eu countries .
only 87.5 percent of coastal waters and 89.6 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu directive .

european justice ministers have agreed to sign a deal that will increase already close cooperation with the united states in the fight against terrorism . a legal cooperation deal between the european union and the united states worked out in secret over the past year is due to be signed in the coming weeks . in an effort to smooth cooperation between the two sides , the pact , which has been under negotiation by justice and home affairs ministers in the 15-member union since the summer , will replace bilateral agreements currently in effect between the united states and countries like germany and britain . officials on both sides of the atlantic praised what is being seen as a shining example of cooperation in one of the few areas where europe and the united states work together in harmony . the greek justice minister , presiding over the meeting of ministers on friday , called the agreement " a step forward . " u.s. officials , already satisfied with anti-terror efforts in europe , were also pleased with the decision . eu wrangles option on extradition the pact dictates closer cooperation on fronts such as mutual legal assistance and the exchange of banking information .
the stickiest issue , extradition , was laid aside after european union states won a clause from the u.s. allowing them to refuse to extradite a suspect who could face the death penalty . eu states are signatories of the european convention on human rights which outlaws the death penalty .
the convention also prohibits any extradition deal that could lead to their citizens facing the death penalty , which is legal in the united states . the issue has been a difficult one for both sides to iron out .
last year , france and germany initially refused to hand over legal documents that u.s. prosecutors wanted to use in the prosecution of french citizen and suspected terrorist-cell member zacarias moussaoui . the two countries later agreed to release the documents . reaction is critical during a meeting with european commission president roman prodi last october , u.s. president george w. bush included the extradition issue on a u.s. wish list . questions remain over a number of other issues , such as the status of suspected taliban and al qaeda fighters held prisoner on guantanamo bay . the european parliament joined human rights organizations such as amnesty international and statewatch in criticizing the deal .
parliamentarians adopted a resolution this week stating that it was " paradoxical to sign an agreement with the united states when several european union citizens are still being held at … guantanamo bay , quite unlawfully .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.06.2003 bracing for the german discount store revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers are getting carried away with discount stores aldi and lidl german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .
and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .
lidl has a strategy to widen its europe-wide presence but when questioned , sources at the company declined to elaborate .

and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .

sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .
lidl has a strategy to widen its europe-wide presence but when questioned , sources at the company declined to elaborate .

and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .

their death serves as a reminder of the risks involved in the afghanistan mission . the sight was a somber one .
hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .
their route took them along the very road where the suicide car bombing took place only three days earlier .
attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .
question of more troops undecided despite the suicide bombing , germany ’ s defense minister has not altogether ruled out expanding the soldiers ’ area of deployment outside kabul .
a reconnaissance team of experts from the bundeswehr was sent to afghanistan on tuesday to explore the possibility of deploying german soldiers to other cities in afghanistan as part of an expanded isaf mission .
after the military experts return in two weeks , defense minister peter struck will present his decision to parliament , which must approve an expansion of the afghanistan mandate .
currently , germany has 2,400 troops stationed in kabul , making it the largest national contingent in the 5,000-strong isaf force .

germany ’ s national railway operator deutsche bahn has already lost many long-distance customers to discount airlines .
but now the bahn ’ s railway rival connex has slowly begun expanding its own cross-country service . private rail company connex , a subsidiary of french conglomerate vivendi , began its third major german route on friday .
two interconnex trains will travel from rostock to cologne via berlin in either direction once daily .
the 912 kilometer-stretch from the baltic sea port to the metropolis on the rhine river will be the operator ’ s first long-distance service .
though the connex service is infrequent and slow – the trip from rostock to cologne takes 12 hours – it could prove to be stiff competition for the beleaguered deutsche bahn if it is deemed a success .
despite running a railway network that would be the envy of many countries , deutsche bahn has come in for heavy criticism for being inefficient , expensive and inflexible .
it ’ s new pricing system introduced late last year was so hated by passengers , that half a year later the former state-run rail operator was embarrassingly forced to admit the initiative had been a disaster .
in an attempt to get travelers to commit themselves to taking the train , the bahn in december instituted a system that rewarded those who booked early with cheaper prices .
but the scheme backfired by overlooking one of the most attractive aspects of train travel – it ’ s spontaneity .
tickets on some heavily-traveled routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spur-of-the-moment , business and tourist travelers particularly hard .
new approach to attract customers , connex has taken a completely opposite approach .
with fixed fees at significantly lower levels than deutsche bahn – cologne to rostock will cost € 50 – connex also allows passengers to buy their tickets on board at no extra charge .
its motto is " climb aboard and go ! "
" the deutsche bahn has cut many regional direct connections , " said joachim kemnitz , a spokesman for the rail travel passenger association pro bahn , according to german news agency dpa .
" that connex is trying to fill gaps in service is being well received by customers , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex boss hans leister told ndr public television that the company ’ s success on its two previous shorter routes in eastern germany had convinced management to slowly expand its service into a nationwide long-distance network .
though deutsche bahn was originally happy to see connex step in where it could no longer offer cost-effective regional service , a rival nationwide network could undercut the bahn just as it is competing with discounted airlines for customers .
bahn spokesman uwe herz said last week that the cheap air carriers were costing deutsche bahn approximately € 80 million a year .
as an example , he cited the cologne-hamburg business service , which has lost a quarter of its passengers since discounted airfares had become available .

the possibility of u.s. military bases in western europe moving east to nato members like the czech republic has sparked a debate in a country still getting over decades of soviet occupation . the last foreign troops based in the czech republic swore allegiance to the ussr .
when the 75,000 soviet soldiers left the country following the collapse of the iron curtain in the early 1990s , many in the czech republic hoped it was the last time soldiers under a foreign flag would set up shop on their home soil .
now , there 's very serious talk in the pentagon of relocating u.s. bases in western europe east to countries like poland and the czech republic - and the country finds itself in the middle of a hot debate .
czechs " are very touchy when it comes to foreign soldiers on our territory .
the renewed stationing of foreign troops would probably not be welcome , " said czech president vaclav klaus in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung last month .
czechs more skeptical than poles the remarks unleashed hefty discussion within the government and parliament .
though government officials largely supported the war against saddam hussein , they stopped short of committing any military personnel , like poland .
there are other signs to indicate they do not share their neighbor 's euphoria in supporting america .
poll numbers suggest that some 43 percent of the czechs would reject the stationing of u.s. troops in their country .
parliamentarians , such as the chair of the foreign affairs committee , also remain skeptical .
" i understand this future , but for us , for me , it 's a problem , a question , " vladimir lastuvka told deutsche welle in an interview .
u.s. : too early for such talk u.s. military leaders insist it 's too early for any talk of soldiers on czech soil .
military planners said the current discussion on the movement of some troops out of germany into eastern european countries is taking part as part of a long-term military reconfiguration .
speculation on the actual move and where it might bring u.s. troops is still premature , they say .
but that has n't stopped eastern european officials from advocating the merits of such a move .
" in the future where are the prevalent possible sources of conflict ?
it 's still the balkans , still the middle east .
we can talk about this movement of american bases as a step towards a higher efficiency for the future deployment of american forces , " deputy prime minister petr mares told deutsche welle .
the new nato member would stand to gain as well , with an american military base lending a feeling of protection and security to the country .
there are also the economic benefits american soldiers will bring to the country , benefits the german towns surrounding u.s. bases in ramstein and landstuhl have known for quite some time .

germany ’ s national railway operator deutsche bahn has already lost many long-distance customers to discount airlines .
but now the bahn ’ s railway rival connex has slowly begun expanding its own cross-country service . private rail company connex , a subsidiary of french conglomerate vivendi , began its third major german route on friday .
two interconnex trains will travel from rostock to cologne via berlin in either direction once daily .
the 912 kilometer-stretch from the baltic sea port to the metropolis on the rhine river will be the operator ’ s first long-distance service .
though the connex service is infrequent and slow – the trip from rostock to cologne takes 12 hours – it could prove to be stiff competition for the beleaguered deutsche bahn if it is deemed a success .
despite running a railway network that would be the envy of many countries , deutsche bahn has come in for heavy criticism for being inefficient , expensive and inflexible .
it ’ s new pricing system introduced late last year was so hated by passengers , that half a year later the former state-run rail operator was embarrassingly forced to admit the initiative had been a disaster .
in an attempt to get travelers to commit themselves to taking the train , the bahn in december instituted a system that rewarded those who booked early with cheaper prices .
but the scheme backfired by overlooking one of the most attractive aspects of train travel – it ’ s spontaneity .
tickets on some heavily-traveled routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spur-of-the-moment , business and tourist travelers particularly hard .
new approach to attract customers , connex has taken a completely opposite approach .
with fixed fees at significantly lower levels than deutsche bahn – cologne to rostock will cost € 50 – connex also allows passengers to buy their tickets on board at no extra charge .
its motto is " climb aboard and go ! "
" the deutsche bahn has cut many regional direct connections , " said joachim kemnitz , a spokesman for the rail travel passenger association pro bahn , according to german news agency dpa .
" that connex is trying to fill gaps in service is being well received by customers , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex boss hans leister told ndr public television that the company ’ s success on its two previous shorter routes in eastern germany had convinced management to slowly expand its service into a nationwide long-distance network .
though deutsche bahn was originally happy to see connex step in where it could no longer offer cost-effective regional service , a rival nationwide network could undercut the bahn just as it is competing with discounted airlines for customers .
bahn spokesman uwe herz said last week that the cheap air carriers were costing deutsche bahn approximately € 80 million a year .
as an example , he cited the cologne-hamburg business service , which has lost a quarter of its passengers since discounted airfares had become available .
" customers will only be convinced to travel by rail with alternative offers and attractive prices , " said connex ’ s leister . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deutsche bahn reforms new price system following months of criticism and heavy losses , germany 's national railway , deutsche bahn , is rolling back some of the most controversial elements of the new price system - more changes are expected by year 's end .

" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "

germany ’ s national railway operator deutsche bahn has already lost many long-distance customers to discount airlines .
but now the bahn ’ s railway rival connex has slowly begun expanding its own cross-country service . private rail company connex , a subsidiary of french conglomerate vivendi , began its third major german route on friday .
two interconnex trains will travel from rostock to cologne via berlin in either direction once daily .
the 912 kilometer-stretch from the baltic sea port to the metropolis on the rhine river will be the operator ’ s first long-distance service .
though the connex service is infrequent and slow – the trip from rostock to cologne takes 12 hours – it could prove to be stiff competition for the beleaguered deutsche bahn if it is deemed a success .
despite running a railway network that would be the envy of many countries , deutsche bahn has come in for heavy criticism for being inefficient , expensive and inflexible .
it ’ s new pricing system introduced late last year was so hated by passengers , that half a year later the former state-run rail operator was embarrassingly forced to admit the initiative had been a disaster .

germany ’ s national railway operator deutsche bahn has already lost many long-distance customers to discount airlines .
but now the bahn ’ s railway rival connex has slowly begun expanding its own cross-country service . private rail company connex , a subsidiary of french conglomerate vivendi , began its third major german route on friday .
two interconnex trains will travel from rostock to cologne via berlin in either direction once daily .
the 912 kilometer-stretch from the baltic sea port to the metropolis on the rhine river will be the operator ’ s first long-distance service .
though the connex service is infrequent and slow – the trip from rostock to cologne takes 12 hours – it could prove to be stiff competition for the beleaguered deutsche bahn if it is deemed a success .
despite running a railway network that would be the envy of many countries , deutsche bahn has come in for heavy criticism for being inefficient , expensive and inflexible .
it ’ s new pricing system introduced late last year was so hated by passengers , that half a year later the former state-run rail operator was embarrassingly forced to admit the initiative had been a disaster .
in an attempt to get travelers to commit themselves to taking the train , the bahn in december instituted a system that rewarded those who booked early with cheaper prices .
but the scheme backfired by overlooking one of the most attractive aspects of train travel – it ’ s spontaneity .
tickets on some heavily-traveled routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spur-of-the-moment , business and tourist travelers particularly hard .

the possibility of u.s. military bases in western europe moving east to nato members like the czech republic has sparked a debate in a country still getting over decades of soviet occupation . the last foreign troops based in the czech republic swore allegiance to the ussr .
when the 75,000 soviet soldiers left the country following the collapse of the iron curtain in the early 1990s , many in the czech republic hoped it was the last time soldiers under a foreign flag would set up shop on their home soil .
now , there 's very serious talk in the pentagon of relocating u.s. bases in western europe east to countries like poland and the czech republic - and the country finds itself in the middle of a hot debate .
czechs " are very touchy when it comes to foreign soldiers on our territory .
the renewed stationing of foreign troops would probably not be welcome , " said czech president vaclav klaus in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung last month .
czechs more skeptical than poles the remarks unleashed hefty discussion within the government and parliament .
though government officials largely supported the war against saddam hussein , they stopped short of committing any military personnel , like poland .
there are other signs to indicate they do not share their neighbor 's euphoria in supporting america .
poll numbers suggest that some 43 percent of the czechs would reject the stationing of u.s. troops in their country .
parliamentarians , such as the chair of the foreign affairs committee , also remain skeptical .
" i understand this future , but for us , for me , it 's a problem , a question , " vladimir lastuvka told deutsche welle in an interview .
u.s. : too early for such talk u.s. military leaders insist it 's too early for any talk of soldiers on czech soil .
military planners said the current discussion on the movement of some troops out of germany into eastern european countries is taking part as part of a long-term military reconfiguration .
speculation on the actual move and where it might bring u.s. troops is still premature , they say .
but that has n't stopped eastern european officials from advocating the merits of such a move .
" in the future where are the prevalent possible sources of conflict ?
it 's still the balkans , still the middle east .
we can talk about this movement of american bases as a step towards a higher efficiency for the future deployment of american forces , " deputy prime minister petr mares told deutsche welle .
the new nato member would stand to gain as well , with an american military base lending a feeling of protection and security to the country .
there are also the economic benefits american soldiers will bring to the country , benefits the german towns surrounding u.s. bases in ramstein and landstuhl have known for quite some time .

germany ’ s national railway operator deutsche bahn has already lost many long-distance customers to discount airlines .
but now the bahn ’ s railway rival connex has slowly begun expanding its own cross-country service . private rail company connex , a subsidiary of french conglomerate vivendi , began its third major german route on friday .
two interconnex trains will travel from rostock to cologne via berlin in either direction once daily .
the 912 kilometer-stretch from the baltic sea port to the metropolis on the rhine river will be the operator ’ s first long-distance service .
though the connex service is infrequent and slow – the trip from rostock to cologne takes 12 hours – it could prove to be stiff competition for the beleaguered deutsche bahn if it is deemed a success .
despite running a railway network that would be the envy of many countries , deutsche bahn has come in for heavy criticism for being inefficient , expensive and inflexible .
it ’ s new pricing system introduced late last year was so hated by passengers , that half a year later the former state-run rail operator was embarrassingly forced to admit the initiative had been a disaster .
in an attempt to get travelers to commit themselves to taking the train , the bahn in december instituted a system that rewarded those who booked early with cheaper prices .
but the scheme backfired by overlooking one of the most attractive aspects of train travel – it ’ s spontaneity .
tickets on some heavily-traveled routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spur-of-the-moment , business and tourist travelers particularly hard .
new approach to attract customers , connex has taken a completely opposite approach .
with fixed fees at significantly lower levels than deutsche bahn – cologne to rostock will cost € 50 – connex also allows passengers to buy their tickets on board at no extra charge .
its motto is " climb aboard and go ! "
" the deutsche bahn has cut many regional direct connections , " said joachim kemnitz , a spokesman for the rail travel passenger association pro bahn , according to german news agency dpa .
" that connex is trying to fill gaps in service is being well received by customers , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex boss hans leister told ndr public television that the company ’ s success on its two previous shorter routes in eastern germany had convinced management to slowly expand its service into a nationwide long-distance network .
though deutsche bahn was originally happy to see connex step in where it could no longer offer cost-effective regional service , a rival nationwide network could undercut the bahn just as it is competing with discounted airlines for customers .
bahn spokesman uwe herz said last week that the cheap air carriers were costing deutsche bahn approximately € 80 million a year .
as an example , he cited the cologne-hamburg business service , which has lost a quarter of its passengers since discounted airfares had become available .

germany ’ s national railway operator deutsche bahn has already lost many long-distance customers to discount airlines .
but now the bahn ’ s railway rival connex has slowly begun expanding its own cross-country service . private rail company connex , a subsidiary of french conglomerate vivendi , began its third major german route on friday .
two interconnex trains will travel from rostock to cologne via berlin in either direction once daily .
the 912 kilometer-stretch from the baltic sea port to the metropolis on the rhine river will be the operator ’ s first long-distance service .
though the connex service is infrequent and slow – the trip from rostock to cologne takes 12 hours – it could prove to be stiff competition for the beleaguered deutsche bahn if it is deemed a success .
despite running a railway network that would be the envy of many countries , deutsche bahn has come in for heavy criticism for being inefficient , expensive and inflexible .
it ’ s new pricing system introduced late last year was so hated by passengers , that half a year later the former state-run rail operator was embarrassingly forced to admit the initiative had been a disaster .
in an attempt to get travelers to commit themselves to taking the train , the bahn in december instituted a system that rewarded those who booked early with cheaper prices .
but the scheme backfired by overlooking one of the most attractive aspects of train travel – it ’ s spontaneity .
tickets on some heavily-traveled routes , such as the line between cologne and berlin , rose by as much as 25 percent , hitting spur-of-the-moment , business and tourist travelers particularly hard .
new approach to attract customers , connex has taken a completely opposite approach .
with fixed fees at significantly lower levels than deutsche bahn – cologne to rostock will cost € 50 – connex also allows passengers to buy their tickets on board at no extra charge .
its motto is " climb aboard and go ! "
" the deutsche bahn has cut many regional direct connections , " said joachim kemnitz , a spokesman for the rail travel passenger association pro bahn , according to german news agency dpa .
" that connex is trying to fill gaps in service is being well received by customers , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : connex boss hans leister told ndr public television that the company ’ s success on its two previous shorter routes in eastern germany had convinced management to slowly expand its service into a nationwide long-distance network .
though deutsche bahn was originally happy to see connex step in where it could no longer offer cost-effective regional service , a rival nationwide network could undercut the bahn just as it is competing with discounted airlines for customers .
bahn spokesman uwe herz said last week that the cheap air carriers were costing deutsche bahn approximately € 80 million a year .
as an example , he cited the cologne-hamburg business service , which has lost a quarter of its passengers since discounted airfares had become available .

their death serves as a reminder of the risks involved in the afghanistan mission . the sight was a somber one .
hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .
their route took them along the very road where the suicide car bombing took place only three days earlier .
attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .
question of more troops undecided despite the suicide bombing , germany ’ s defense minister has not altogether ruled out expanding the soldiers ’ area of deployment outside kabul .
a reconnaissance team of experts from the bundeswehr was sent to afghanistan on tuesday to explore the possibility of deploying german soldiers to other cities in afghanistan as part of an expanded isaf mission .
after the military experts return in two weeks , defense minister peter struck will present his decision to parliament , which must approve an expansion of the afghanistan mandate .
currently , germany has 2,400 troops stationed in kabul , making it the largest national contingent in the 5,000-strong isaf force .
germany also shares command of the international peacekeeping force with the netherlands .

their death serves as a reminder of the risks involved in the afghanistan mission . the sight was a somber one .
hundreds of soldiers from the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- gathered in kabul on tuesday morning to pay their last respects to the four german soldiers killed in a suicide bombing in the afghan capital on saturday .
many of the members from the 29-nation force fought back tears as they listened to the single bugle play beside the four coffins draped in german flags .
the deaths of their colleagues reminded them of the risks they face in securing peace in the still unstable afghanistan .
the acting head of the 5,000-strong isaf force vowed to continue the mission in afghanistan despite suffering the worst attack against the international peacekeeping troops since their deployment in kabul in late 2001 .
" our respect for the sacrifice of our comrades can only be made in one way , to continue on the mission as well as we can , show determination and make clear that we will not be intimidated , " said brigadier general robert bertholee .
after the ceremony , which was held at camp warehouse , the headquarters for the german isaf contingent , the four coffins were driven in convoy to the airport for their flight back home .
their route took them along the very road where the suicide car bombing took place only three days earlier .
attacks part of risk isaf spokesman lieutenant colonel thomas lobbering said additional security measures had been undertaken to reduce the risk of further attacks against the international troops , but added , " this type of terrorist attack can not be avoided one hundred percent , they are part of our task here . "
afghan president hamid karzai said the attack was the work of foreign terrorists .
he told reporters that the suicide car bomber was not an afghan national .
the attack , which killed the four soldiers and severely injured 29 others , took place early saturday morning when a taxi packed with explosives detonated next to a bus carrying german isaf soldiers on their way to the kabul airport .
question of more troops undecided despite the suicide bombing , germany ’ s defense minister has not altogether ruled out expanding the soldiers ’ area of deployment outside kabul .
a reconnaissance team of experts from the bundeswehr was sent to afghanistan on tuesday to explore the possibility of deploying german soldiers to other cities in afghanistan as part of an expanded isaf mission .
after the military experts return in two weeks , defense minister peter struck will present his decision to parliament , which must approve an expansion of the afghanistan mandate .
currently , germany has 2,400 troops stationed in kabul , making it the largest national contingent in the 5,000-strong isaf force .
germany also shares command of the international peacekeeping force with the netherlands .
an expansion of the german mission would require sending more troops to afghanistan , a move many in parliament are hesitant to make given the current instability in the region . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de 4 germans killed in kabul suicide bombing five people were killed and at least 30 injured in an apparent suicide bombing attack on an isaf bus in afghanistan -lrb- june 7 , 2002 -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.06.2003 bracing for the german discount store revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers are getting carried away with discount stores aldi and lidl german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .
and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .
aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .
lidl has a strategy to widen its europe-wide presence but when questioned , sources at the company declined to elaborate .

aldi in the united states ireland is just the latest country to re-shuffle its market to accommodate aldi and lidl .
since its birth in 1960 , aldi has spread into 13 countries across the planet , moving its core european base into countries as far flung as australia and the united states .
in the u.s. , aldi is slowly taking on such established homegrown giants as wal-mart and k-mart in the lower price sector and making good money by doing so .
aldi 's turnover in the united states was estimated at $ 4 billion -lrb- € 3.4 billion -rrb- in 1999 .
the german chain now has over 671 stores in 25 states and intends to continue its spread , not only in the united states but also in other countries where the company has already made an impact .
a spokesperson for aldi told deutsche welle that although there were no immediate plans to open in any new countries , the company spread in those where they already have a presence would continue as per its expansion strategy .
" our typical strategy is to open a distribution center capable of supporting 50 to 100 stores , and to build up volume slowly and steadily .
in the countries where we have a distribution center , we will be following that plan . "
and once aldi becomes established , the stores are there for the long haul .
" we absolutely guarantee that we will never exit a country we have entered , " the spokesperson added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 10.06.2003 bracing for the german discount store revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : customers are getting carried away with discount stores aldi and lidl german discount supermarkets aldi and lidl are slowly but surely extending their global reach .
and in ireland , the latest market to accomodate them , rivals are getting jittery . a recent market study shows that german discount supermarket chains aldi and lidl are preparing to extend their reach into ireland .
as the two companies challenge each other for domination in their european discount niche , the result is a global spread that has rival stores all over the world sweating nervously .
in terms of an invasion , it looks more like a well-planned and slow paced revolution .
instead of a concerted and aggressive thrust through the countries targeted , the german discount retailers aldi and lidl are subverting the population at the source – the high street stores .
armed with bargains and traditional german products , aldi and lidl are proving to be very popular in almost all the countries they move into .
after conquering belgium , france , spain and even the united states and australia , the latest market to succumb to the cut-price , no frills chains is the irish supermarket industry .
it appears to be the next step in an escalating expansion plan which is setting the two discount giants against each other in markets all over the globe .
irish expansion in mind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in less than five years after the first store opening on the emerald isle , aldi and lidl have cut themselves a five percent slice of the irish grocery market pie .
the german chains have a total of 46 stores between them , 36 of them belonging to lidl .
aldi seems determined not to be left behind as surveyors assess up to 90 sites across the country .
sources for the company told the market research company mahon retail research , who published the study , that aldi would not be opening stores on all these sites but their interest in such a number strongly hints at the company ’ s intent to expand its reach in the irish market .
it is a situation that has got the local supermarket chiefs shifting uncomfortably in their boardroom seats .
although aldi and lidl are the first choice for only 8.5 percent of the shopping population in ireland , behind dunnes stores -lrb- 27.5 percent -rrb- , tesco -lrb- 25 percent -rrb- and superquinn -lrb- 23 percent -rrb- , the recent report shows them an emerging force when it comes to shopping for basic items .
the germans appear to be making dents in the sales of toiletries , detergents and other household goods as well as alcohol .
their strength of sales in these areas also means that they benefit from the so-called repeat trade , those satisfied customers who come back for more .
widening customer base bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it also seems that the traditional lower income customer base for the discount stores is encompassing a much wider proportion of the population .
the research by mahon retail showed that for those polled in the county donegal research area , price has now become a major consideration for most irish shoppers – and aldi and lidl are under-cutting their rivals considerably on this score , by up to 25 percent on some products .
everything looks set for a battle for the purse strings of the irish shopper .
and it may herald hard times ahead for the local chains as they slash prices to compete with the germans while trying to manage their own rising input costs .
although lowering prices will benefit dunnes , tesco and superquinn immediately , the long-term effect of adopting the discount model , according to the irish business and employers confederation 's -lrb- ibec -rrb- food and drink federation , could be the loss of up to 20,000 jobs in the irish food retail industry .
the odds seem heavily in favor of the germans in the current irish retail climate .
aldi and lidl employ small numbers of non-unionized staff in their stores , they typically operate in stores around 15,000 square feet in size – remaining unaffected by the government ’ s cap on store size – and supply their supermarkets from lower cost sources , again bypassing laws which ban the sale of below cost selling .
feargal quinn , the chairman of superquinn stores in ireland told deutsche welle how the irish supermarket chain had been affected by the arrival of the german discount shops : " of course we are being affected by aldi and lidl in ireland , they ’ re having quite an impact , " he said .
" we ’ re not concerned about losing customers , but we are concerned at losing out on some of the products our customers buy , namely bathroom and kitchen products . "
quinn added that the stores feeling the pinch were mostly those who competed in the cut-price sector infiltrated by the germans .
" as we focus more on the quality of service and diversity of product range , we haven ’ t been hit as yet in the area of pricing . "
imports benefit discount stores another aspect that is concerning the irish chains is the fact that aldi and lidl are more likely to use overseas sources for goods and services .
whereas just over 20 percent of the total amount spent for irish food retail - worth € 8.4 billion in 2002 – goes on imports , the ibec estimates that imports account for 80 percent of the amount spent by discount groceries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in an area where aldi and lidl are dominating , superquinn has taken its own steps to make sure the lure of continental products and the cheaper rates from european suppliers do not contribute to a drop in customer numbers .
" the german discount stores buy almost all their products from european suppliers , " said feargal quinn .
" in response , superquinn now buys a range of products through ams -lsb- the association of retailers , based in the netherlands -rsb- under the euroshopper label . "
quinn added that the advantage his stores have over the germans is that they stock irish products as well as imported goods .
" you ’ ll always have shoppers who prefer to buy local products , " he said .

vacationers in europe will be relieved to know that most bathing waters in the eu are clean .
the seaside , in particular , is mainly free from pollution , a recent report on water quality shows . parents can send their offspring into the waves with a clear conscience this summer , since a report revealed the quality of bathing waters in most of the european union 's coasts and lakes was very high .
the continent 's most popular beach holiday destinations , greece , italy , portugal and spain , complied more than 96 percent with eu water quality directives , an eu study published late last week shows .
but germany and france did n't fulfill the regulations ; their water quality has decreased over the past few years .
the results compiled for 2002 showed that 95.8 percent of coastal sites and 91 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu 's compulsory standards , despite the torrential rains and floods that plagued central europe in august and september 2002 .
the report took account of samples analyzed in 13,627 coastal beaches and 5,773 freshwater areas " the impact of water quality on bathers is a clear demonstration of the linkages between environmental quality and human health , " eu environment commissioner margot wallström said while introducing the report .
" the susceptibility of children to gastric infections and respiratory illnesses associated with swimming in polluted waters underlined why we need to maintain our vigilance . "
wallström criticized the tendency among some states to ban bathing or strike locations from lists of bathing sites in places that did not meet eu 's standards .
instead , she said , states should deal with the causes of pollution .
poor results in germany , france germany scored lower than the previous year with 97.3 percent compliance for saltwater sites , two percent less than last year .
the situation was more dramatic in german lakes , which slid by six percentage points to 83 percent .
the drop was reportedly due to heavy rains and floods .
nonetheless , germany 's larger lakes like bodensee , chiemsee , schliersee and tegernsee , as well as all but two in berlin were declared safe .
in france compliance rates were among the lowest for all eu countries .
only 87.5 percent of coastal waters and 89.6 percent of freshwater sites complied with the eu directive .
the netherlands , by contrast , displayed the eu 's highest standards , with 100 percent of all waters fully compliant .
the bathing water directive established in 1976 looks mainly at fecal contamination and whether the water looks appealing to swim in .

the possibility of u.s. military bases in western europe moving east to nato members like the czech republic has sparked a debate in a country still getting over decades of soviet occupation . the last foreign troops based in the czech republic swore allegiance to the ussr .
when the 75,000 soviet soldiers left the country following the collapse of the iron curtain in the early 1990s , many in the czech republic hoped it was the last time soldiers under a foreign flag would set up shop on their home soil .
now , there 's very serious talk in the pentagon of relocating u.s. bases in western europe east to countries like poland and the czech republic - and the country finds itself in the middle of a hot debate .
czechs " are very touchy when it comes to foreign soldiers on our territory .
the renewed stationing of foreign troops would probably not be welcome , " said czech president vaclav klaus in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung last month .
czechs more skeptical than poles the remarks unleashed hefty discussion within the government and parliament .
though government officials largely supported the war against saddam hussein , they stopped short of committing any military personnel , like poland .
there are other signs to indicate they do not share their neighbor 's euphoria in supporting america .
poll numbers suggest that some 43 percent of the czechs would reject the stationing of u.s. troops in their country .
parliamentarians , such as the chair of the foreign affairs committee , also remain skeptical .
" i understand this future , but for us , for me , it 's a problem , a question , " vladimir lastuvka told deutsche welle in an interview .
u.s. : too early for such talk u.s. military leaders insist it 's too early for any talk of soldiers on czech soil .
military planners said the current discussion on the movement of some troops out of germany into eastern european countries is taking part as part of a long-term military reconfiguration .
speculation on the actual move and where it might bring u.s. troops is still premature , they say .
but that has n't stopped eastern european officials from advocating the merits of such a move .
" in the future where are the prevalent possible sources of conflict ?
it 's still the balkans , still the middle east .
we can talk about this movement of american bases as a step towards a higher efficiency for the future deployment of american forces , " deputy prime minister petr mares told deutsche welle .
the new nato member would stand to gain as well , with an american military base lending a feeling of protection and security to the country .
there are also the economic benefits american soldiers will bring to the country , benefits the german towns surrounding u.s. bases in ramstein and landstuhl have known for quite some time .
" i think that it 's maybe a good idea , because american soldiers are professional , " said one czech man in an on-the-street interview with deutsche welle .
" and i think it 's good for the economy in our country too . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de will u.s. scale down military presence in germany ?
thousands of jobs in germany could be under threat if rumors of a massive re-structuring of u.s. european military deployment leads to a reduction of u.s. troops stationed in germany .

the possibility of u.s. military bases in western europe moving east to nato members like the czech republic has sparked a debate in a country still getting over decades of soviet occupation . the last foreign troops based in the czech republic swore allegiance to the ussr .
when the 75,000 soviet soldiers left the country following the collapse of the iron curtain in the early 1990s , many in the czech republic hoped it was the last time soldiers under a foreign flag would set up shop on their home soil .
now , there 's very serious talk in the pentagon of relocating u.s. bases in western europe east to countries like poland and the czech republic - and the country finds itself in the middle of a hot debate .
czechs " are very touchy when it comes to foreign soldiers on our territory .
the renewed stationing of foreign troops would probably not be welcome , " said czech president vaclav klaus in an interview with the süddeutsche zeitung last month .
czechs more skeptical than poles the remarks unleashed hefty discussion within the government and parliament .
though government officials largely supported the war against saddam hussein , they stopped short of committing any military personnel , like poland .
there are other signs to indicate they do not share their neighbor 's euphoria in supporting america .
poll numbers suggest that some 43 percent of the czechs would reject the stationing of u.s. troops in their country .
parliamentarians , such as the chair of the foreign affairs committee , also remain skeptical .
" i understand this future , but for us , for me , it 's a problem , a question , " vladimir lastuvka told deutsche welle in an interview .
u.s. : too early for such talk u.s. military leaders insist it 's too early for any talk of soldiers on czech soil .
military planners said the current discussion on the movement of some troops out of germany into eastern european countries is taking part as part of a long-term military reconfiguration .
speculation on the actual move and where it might bring u.s. troops is still premature , they say .
but that has n't stopped eastern european officials from advocating the merits of such a move .
" in the future where are the prevalent possible sources of conflict ?
it 's still the balkans , still the middle east .
we can talk about this movement of american bases as a step towards a higher efficiency for the future deployment of american forces , " deputy prime minister petr mares told deutsche welle .
the new nato member would stand to gain as well , with an american military base lending a feeling of protection and security to the country .
there are also the economic benefits american soldiers will bring to the country , benefits the german towns surrounding u.s. bases in ramstein and landstuhl have known for quite some time .

researchers from glasgow and dundee are using their expertise in gas detection to create a reliable programme for respiratory clinics .
their work has resulted in a proof of concept award which will be officially recognised at the summer science exhibition in london next month .
lung cancer is diagnosed in over 30,000 patients a year in the uk .
' exhaled breath ' less than 7 % of patients survive for five years due to the lack of early symptoms and late diagnosis .
an effective early screening technique has the potential to significantly increase this survival rate .
professor miles padgett , from the university of glasgow , said he was excited by the breath-test 's potential to detect disease quickly .
he said : " our project hopes to demonstrate that ultra-sensitive gas detection in exhaled breath can be applied to the wide scale screening programme for diseases such as lung cancer and cardiovascular disease .
we want to look into the feasibility of producing an instrument capable of being operated by non-specialist staff prof miles padgett university of glasgow " this gas detection technique has been proven in the oil and gas industry but not yet for medical screening .
" we want to look into the feasibility of producing an instrument capable of being operated by non-specialist staff .
" this would enable routine examination of thousands of breath samples and allow this new diagnosis tool to be included as part of the test sequence used by respiratory clinics . "
' screening tool ' dr chris longbottom , of dundee university 's dental school and centre for clinical innovations , said they hoped to involve doctors and dentists in the project .
he said : " this will help to determine if this technique will be of value as a screening tool for apparently healthy individuals and / or a specific diagnostic tool for patients with symptoms . "
the proof of concept fund , launched in 1999 , supports leading-edge technologies in scotland 's academic institutions .
it aims to help export innovation from the lab into the global marketplace .

depression alliance scotland claims 300,000 people with depression were seen by gps in scotland in 2001 .
however , while the condition afflicts men as often as women , men accounted for only a third of gp consultations .
the discrepancy has led to concerns that scotland 's already high level of suicide among young men could increase .
according to the study , treatment could improve and more could be done to lessen the stigma attached to the condition .
barriers to effective care highlighted in the report include : a lack of public awareness that depression is a medical illness people have difficulty in expressing themselves to their gps problems in accessing services directly .
the survey revealed problems with alcohol , drugs and aggression are more prevalent among men who experience depression .
men are also more likely to report sexual problems associated with depression .
ilena brown , co-ordinator for depression alliance scotland , said : " our findings confirm that there are still major barriers in scotland when seeking to encourage men with depression to seek help .
" it is of particular concern that the major barrier would appear to be the stigma associated with depression , and other forms of mental illness , and that this is preventing men from accessing treatment , which could significantly improve their quality of life and , in many cases , avert the tragedy of suicide .

she added : " the message is simple - we have to work as a society at reducing the stigma associated with depression if we are to avoid the further premature loss of life in young men . "

depression alliance scotland claims 300,000 people with depression were seen by gps in scotland in 2001 .
however , while the condition afflicts men as often as women , men accounted for only a third of gp consultations .
the discrepancy has led to concerns that scotland 's already high level of suicide among young men could increase .

barriers to effective care highlighted in the report include : a lack of public awareness that depression is a medical illness people have difficulty in expressing themselves to their gps problems in accessing services directly .
the survey revealed problems with alcohol , drugs and aggression are more prevalent among men who experience depression .
men are also more likely to report sexual problems associated with depression .
ilena brown , co-ordinator for depression alliance scotland , said : " our findings confirm that there are still major barriers in scotland when seeking to encourage men with depression to seek help .
" it is of particular concern that the major barrier would appear to be the stigma associated with depression , and other forms of mental illness , and that this is preventing men from accessing treatment , which could significantly improve their quality of life and , in many cases , avert the tragedy of suicide .
