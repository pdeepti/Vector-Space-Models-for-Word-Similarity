the german press on tuesday focused on allegations that the german government had paid ransom to secure the release of hostage in the sahara .
other papers concentrated on the ongoing pension reforms . the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- criticized this comment by the green party parliamentary speaker ludger volmer for saying , “ germany does not pay ransoms - and if it did , it wouldn ’ t admit it . ” the paper called his comments “ extraordinarily clumsy ” and said they indicated to potential kidnappers " that blackmailing the german government out of a few million euros is child ’ s play . ”
the ftd continued : “ the hostage takers have got what they wanted .
it ’ s no solution to let the local government buy them off and then transfer the money under the guise of development aid . ”
it went on to say volmer ’ s remark highlighted the government ’ s dilemma .
“ a state can not give in to the demands of bandits and terror groups , but at the same time it is responsible for every one of its citizens , and this responsibility doesn ’ t end at the german border . ”
the braunschweiger zeitung warned the end of the sahara hostages ’ ordeal didn ’ t mean germany had been given the all-clear ; rather quite the opposite .
it saw the likelihood that the german government has paid a ransom of possibly millions of euro , as an encouragement to terrorists all over the world to lie in wait for new victims .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung agreed .
“ the government shouldn ’ t let itself be blackmailed , certainly not by terrorists or greedy criminals , ” it wrote .
it also commented that questions would now be asked about the degree of responsibility on the part of the hostages themselves .
“ they travelled to a country not renowned for its safety , knowing that someone would come to their aid if the worst came to the worst , ” the paper wrote .
“ one could hold that against them , ” it said , “ but it would be better to do this behind closed doors . ”
several german papers however didn ’ t heed the faz ’ s warning to be discreet .
the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung asked why daredevil “ extreme ” tourists continued to ignore warnings about regional conflict zones crime and violent separatists .
“ the southern sahara has long been considered dangerous territory , ” the daily wrote , “ but for people looking for adventure , this is a kind of encouragement : it ’ s the warnings that make the area interesting . ”

schools in three states are offering muslim students a chance to learn about their faith in the german language instead of in their mother tongue , in a move that ’ s hoped to contribute towards better integration . as schools in germany get ready to welcome back students after six long weeks of summer vacation , a few in berlin , lower saxony and bavaria feature a new subject on their curriculum - islamic education .
the idea isn ’ t exactly new .
in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .
but germany ’ s complex federal system of education , whereby education remains a prerogative of the länder or states , has meant that the proposal couldn ’ t be applied across the board .
the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .
" contributing towards integration and tolerance " the number of states offering islamic education in german has been growing gradually .
the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to 800,000 muslims , has sponsored optional islamic religion instruction classes as a sort of test run in 24 schools since 1999 . last year , in a rare move , berlin , lower saxony and bavaria committed themselves to introducing concrete islamic education in the german language in close cooperation with islamic organizations in the country .
while berlin got off to a head start with the subject already offered in around 20 schools and now being extended to 30 this week , lower saxony and bavaria are treading new ground with it .
mr. weszling , a spokesman at the education ministry in lower saxony , home to about 40,000 muslim students , told deutsche welle the model was initially being tested on eight primary schools in the state and had been hammered out together with islamic organizations .
" the parents will decide whether they want to send their children to the class , " he said , but added " we ’ re hoping it will contribute towards integration , tolerance and more understanding of the religion . "
the classes , weszling said , would deal more with the factual aspects of the faith rather than the practice and belief .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier stressed earlier this year at a press conference , the islamic education model at a school in erlangen was based on close cooperation with muslims living permanently in bavaria and receptive to integration .
she said it gave priority to " values laid down in the constitution such as human dignity , freedom , equality and tolerance . "
the minister added the aim was to " allow muslim students a suitable offer in their schools to learn more about their own faith . "
lessons in german can ensure transparency islamic instruction in german may be a new feature , but private lessons have existed in germany since the first turkish immigrants began arriving in the 1960s and are now offered by teachers across the country in arabic and bosnian as well .
however the discovery of the hamburg terror cell and germany ’ s subsequent clampdown on islamist and extremist organizations in the country , have heightened concerns about extremist views trickling into lessons conducted by islamic organizations in koran schools and back rooms of mosques .
officials stress that drawing the state into the issue will ensure it a greater degree of transparency .
" when islamic classes are held in german and under the state-school board , we know what gets taught , " social democrat ute vogt , head of the domestic policy committee in germany ’ s parliament said last year during the height of the debate . " it ’ s important for the state to have control so that there ’ s no possibility islamic education could turn into an anti-democratic movement , " hans-gert lange , spokesman for the federal office for the protection of the constitution told deutsche welle .
no legitimate muslim representative but it ’ s not just security concerns that have delayed efforts so far in getting islamic education well off the ground .
most states interested in offering the subject in german complain there ’ s no legitimate representative on the muslim side such as is the case with the church , who they can deal with in shaping religious lessons .
" it ’ s a very fundamental problem , " thomas john of berlin ’ s education ministry said .
" there are so many sunni , shiite and alewites groups .
it ’ s difficult to find a unified voice .
we can only hope the muslims can come to an agreement about that . "
unlike in france , where a recently-formed national council for muslims represents the country ’ s five-million community and deals directly with the french state on all issues , germany has a bunch of splintered islamic organizations , all with their own agenda and often in competition with each other .
but ali kizilkaya the chairman of the council of muslims , one of the largest organizations , said there were enough muslim representatives the german state could talk to if it was interested .
" we have the impression that all models are headed towards not allowing muslims to participate , " he told news agency afp . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows what germans think about islam a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling .

schools in three states are offering muslim students a chance to learn about their faith in the german language instead of in their mother tongue , in a move that ’ s hoped to contribute towards better integration . as schools in germany get ready to welcome back students after six long weeks of summer vacation , a few in berlin , lower saxony and bavaria feature a new subject on their curriculum - islamic education .
the idea isn ’ t exactly new .
in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .
but germany ’ s complex federal system of education , whereby education remains a prerogative of the länder or states , has meant that the proposal couldn ’ t be applied across the board .
the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .
" contributing towards integration and tolerance " the number of states offering islamic education in german has been growing gradually .
the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to 800,000 muslims , has sponsored optional islamic religion instruction classes as a sort of test run in 24 schools since 1999 . last year , in a rare move , berlin , lower saxony and bavaria committed themselves to introducing concrete islamic education in the german language in close cooperation with islamic organizations in the country .
while berlin got off to a head start with the subject already offered in around 20 schools and now being extended to 30 this week , lower saxony and bavaria are treading new ground with it .
mr. weszling , a spokesman at the education ministry in lower saxony , home to about 40,000 muslim students , told deutsche welle the model was initially being tested on eight primary schools in the state and had been hammered out together with islamic organizations .
" the parents will decide whether they want to send their children to the class , " he said , but added " we ’ re hoping it will contribute towards integration , tolerance and more understanding of the religion . "
the classes , weszling said , would deal more with the factual aspects of the faith rather than the practice and belief .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier stressed earlier this year at a press conference , the islamic education model at a school in erlangen was based on close cooperation with muslims living permanently in bavaria and receptive to integration .
she said it gave priority to " values laid down in the constitution such as human dignity , freedom , equality and tolerance . "
the minister added the aim was to " allow muslim students a suitable offer in their schools to learn more about their own faith . "
lessons in german can ensure transparency islamic instruction in german may be a new feature , but private lessons have existed in germany since the first turkish immigrants began arriving in the 1960s and are now offered by teachers across the country in arabic and bosnian as well .
however the discovery of the hamburg terror cell and germany ’ s subsequent clampdown on islamist and extremist organizations in the country , have heightened concerns about extremist views trickling into lessons conducted by islamic organizations in koran schools and back rooms of mosques .
officials stress that drawing the state into the issue will ensure it a greater degree of transparency .
" when islamic classes are held in german and under the state-school board , we know what gets taught , " social democrat ute vogt , head of the domestic policy committee in germany ’ s parliament said last year during the height of the debate . " it ’ s important for the state to have control so that there ’ s no possibility islamic education could turn into an anti-democratic movement , " hans-gert lange , spokesman for the federal office for the protection of the constitution told deutsche welle .
no legitimate muslim representative but it ’ s not just security concerns that have delayed efforts so far in getting islamic education well off the ground .
most states interested in offering the subject in german complain there ’ s no legitimate representative on the muslim side such as is the case with the church , who they can deal with in shaping religious lessons .
" it ’ s a very fundamental problem , " thomas john of berlin ’ s education ministry said .
" there are so many sunni , shiite and alewites groups .
it ’ s difficult to find a unified voice .
we can only hope the muslims can come to an agreement about that . "
unlike in france , where a recently-formed national council for muslims represents the country ’ s five-million community and deals directly with the french state on all issues , germany has a bunch of splintered islamic organizations , all with their own agenda and often in competition with each other .
but ali kizilkaya the chairman of the council of muslims , one of the largest organizations , said there were enough muslim representatives the german state could talk to if it was interested .

mayor ole von beust fired ronald schill after the former judge allegedly threatened to out him . hamburg mayor ole von beust fired the city-state 's controversial interior minister on tuesday .
he said that ' law and order ' man ronald schill had threatened to publicly out beust as a homosexual .
" i have dismissed mr. schill , " beust told reporters .
" i felt forced to dismiss him because schill 's character is not suited to the office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust .
the two men had met to discuss schill 's deputy walter wellinghausen , who beust -lrb- picture -rrb- also dismissed .
wellinghausen , who had been schill 's attorney , has been accused of illegally continuing to collect pay in another capacity after he became privy counselor .
according to beust , schill said the mayor had made his ostensible partner his justice minister and that the two had a homosexual relationship .
" the end of a nightmare " relief was apparent after schill 's sacking was announced .
" for the police , it 's the end of a nightmare , " the head of the police trade union , konrad freiberg , said .
" the dgb emphatically welcomes the fact that ole von beust dismissed interior minister schill and his privy counsel wellinghausen , " german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- regional head erhard pumm announced .
even representatives from schill 's coalition partner , the free democratic party , expressed relief , " we have absolutely no sympathy for mr. schill 's behavior .
we consider mayor von beust 's actions appropriate . "
although ronald barnabas schill disputed beust 's accusations , he said he now wished to retire from politics .
hamburg 's haider the dismissal may mark the end of a short but dramatic career in politics for the hamburg judge .
" judge merciless , " as the german media dubbed him , first drew nationwide attention for the draconic sentences he handed down in the hamburg court he presided over .
the " law-and-order " man formed his own political party , the schill party in july 2000 and campaigned in the september 2001 hamburg elections .
at the same time as fending off comparisons to austria 's rightwing politician jörg haider , schill called for sex offenders to be castrated , suspected drug dealers to be fed emetics to retrieve evidence and convicted foreigners to be deported .
throughout the campaign he was haunted by the three-day jail sentence he had imposed on the two young men in 1999 for disturbing court proceedings .
a hamburg court had already convicted schill of false imprisonment and perversion of justice based on accusations that he delayed a complaint made by the men .
but schill 's hardline appealed to the hamburg electorate .
his party earned 19.4 percent of the votes in the traditionally social democratic city , 25 of the 121 mandates .
suddenly the schill party had the chance to make-up part of the city 's ruling coalition , which after more than three weeks of talks it did , along with the christian democrats and the free democrats .
schill was named interior minister and deputy mayor , while two other party members headed up hamburg ministries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schill gave hamburg cops a makeover .
schill 's first 100 days in office , starting on october 31 , 2001 , were overshadowed by accusations that the senator used cocaine and the furore surrounding the expensive uniforms he ordered to make hamburg 's police look " nicer . "
he submitted hair for a drug test that cleared him of the drug-taking charges .
schill was acquitted of false imprisonment and perversion of justice in december 2001 .
schill , the court said " objectively " perverted justice , but not on purpose , and he had lied .
hours later schill named his defense attorney , walter wellinghausen , privy counselor in the interior ministry .
uproar in parliament the national spotlight turned to schill again in late august 2002 when he addressed the german parliament during a discussion of aid for flooded german regions .
schill used the opportunity to accuse the german governments of the past years of " total failure . "
twice schill 's microphone was turned off after he refused to bring his rant to an end .
across the political spectrum german politicians and the media were scandalized by schill 's behavior .
" this is the last time that such a thing will happen , " hamburg mayor beust announced in response .
beust has been as good as his word , despite the risk that it could have meant the end for his three-way coalition .
so far though , the ruling coalition is standing firm .
after a meeting on tuesday the three parties announced that their cooperation would continue uninterrupted .
schill party chairman mario mettbach said the disgraced interior minister 's predecessor will be named by friday .
the hamburg district attorney is investigating whether to take legal action against schill for coercion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

lessons in german can ensure transparency islamic instruction in german may be a new feature , but private lessons have existed in germany since the first turkish immigrants began arriving in the 1960s and are now offered by teachers across the country in arabic and bosnian as well .
however the discovery of the hamburg terror cell and germany ’ s subsequent clampdown on islamist and extremist organizations in the country , have heightened concerns about extremist views trickling into lessons conducted by islamic organizations in koran schools and back rooms of mosques .
officials stress that drawing the state into the issue will ensure it a greater degree of transparency .
" when islamic classes are held in german and under the state-school board , we know what gets taught , " social democrat ute vogt , head of the domestic policy committee in germany ’ s parliament said last year during the height of the debate . " it ’ s important for the state to have control so that there ’ s no possibility islamic education could turn into an anti-democratic movement , " hans-gert lange , spokesman for the federal office for the protection of the constitution told deutsche welle .
no legitimate muslim representative but it ’ s not just security concerns that have delayed efforts so far in getting islamic education well off the ground .
most states interested in offering the subject in german complain there ’ s no legitimate representative on the muslim side such as is the case with the church , who they can deal with in shaping religious lessons .
" it ’ s a very fundamental problem , " thomas john of berlin ’ s education ministry said .
" there are so many sunni , shiite and alewites groups .
it ’ s difficult to find a unified voice .
we can only hope the muslims can come to an agreement about that . "
unlike in france , where a recently-formed national council for muslims represents the country ’ s five-million community and deals directly with the french state on all issues , germany has a bunch of splintered islamic organizations , all with their own agenda and often in competition with each other .
but ali kizilkaya the chairman of the council of muslims , one of the largest organizations , said there were enough muslim representatives the german state could talk to if it was interested .
" we have the impression that all models are headed towards not allowing muslims to participate , " he told news agency afp . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows what germans think about islam a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling .

mayor ole von beust fired ronald schill after the former judge allegedly threatened to out him . hamburg mayor ole von beust fired the city-state 's controversial interior minister on tuesday .
he said that ' law and order ' man ronald schill had threatened to publicly out beust as a homosexual .
" i have dismissed mr. schill , " beust told reporters .
" i felt forced to dismiss him because schill 's character is not suited to the office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust .
the two men had met to discuss schill 's deputy walter wellinghausen , who beust -lrb- picture -rrb- also dismissed .
wellinghausen , who had been schill 's attorney , has been accused of illegally continuing to collect pay in another capacity after he became privy counselor .
according to beust , schill said the mayor had made his ostensible partner his justice minister and that the two had a homosexual relationship .
" the end of a nightmare " relief was apparent after schill 's sacking was announced .
" for the police , it 's the end of a nightmare , " the head of the police trade union , konrad freiberg , said .
" the dgb emphatically welcomes the fact that ole von beust dismissed interior minister schill and his privy counsel wellinghausen , " german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- regional head erhard pumm announced .
even representatives from schill 's coalition partner , the free democratic party , expressed relief , " we have absolutely no sympathy for mr. schill 's behavior .
we consider mayor von beust 's actions appropriate . "
although ronald barnabas schill disputed beust 's accusations , he said he now wished to retire from politics .
hamburg 's haider the dismissal may mark the end of a short but dramatic career in politics for the hamburg judge .
" judge merciless , " as the german media dubbed him , first drew nationwide attention for the draconic sentences he handed down in the hamburg court he presided over .
the " law-and-order " man formed his own political party , the schill party in july 2000 and campaigned in the september 2001 hamburg elections .
at the same time as fending off comparisons to austria 's rightwing politician jörg haider , schill called for sex offenders to be castrated , suspected drug dealers to be fed emetics to retrieve evidence and convicted foreigners to be deported .
throughout the campaign he was haunted by the three-day jail sentence he had imposed on the two young men in 1999 for disturbing court proceedings .
a hamburg court had already convicted schill of false imprisonment and perversion of justice based on accusations that he delayed a complaint made by the men .
but schill 's hardline appealed to the hamburg electorate .
his party earned 19.4 percent of the votes in the traditionally social democratic city , 25 of the 121 mandates .
suddenly the schill party had the chance to make-up part of the city 's ruling coalition , which after more than three weeks of talks it did , along with the christian democrats and the free democrats .
schill was named interior minister and deputy mayor , while two other party members headed up hamburg ministries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schill gave hamburg cops a makeover .
schill 's first 100 days in office , starting on october 31 , 2001 , were overshadowed by accusations that the senator used cocaine and the furore surrounding the expensive uniforms he ordered to make hamburg 's police look " nicer . "
he submitted hair for a drug test that cleared him of the drug-taking charges .
schill was acquitted of false imprisonment and perversion of justice in december 2001 .
schill , the court said " objectively " perverted justice , but not on purpose , and he had lied .
hours later schill named his defense attorney , walter wellinghausen , privy counselor in the interior ministry .
uproar in parliament the national spotlight turned to schill again in late august 2002 when he addressed the german parliament during a discussion of aid for flooded german regions .
schill used the opportunity to accuse the german governments of the past years of " total failure . "
twice schill 's microphone was turned off after he refused to bring his rant to an end .
across the political spectrum german politicians and the media were scandalized by schill 's behavior .
" this is the last time that such a thing will happen , " hamburg mayor beust announced in response .
beust has been as good as his word , despite the risk that it could have meant the end for his three-way coalition .
so far though , the ruling coalition is standing firm .
after a meeting on tuesday the three parties announced that their cooperation would continue uninterrupted .
schill party chairman mario mettbach said the disgraced interior minister 's predecessor will be named by friday .

whereas previously the shootings and explosions carried out by unknown guerillas in the streets of the war-torn country have concentrated on the occupying forces , this latest targeting of the u.n. spreads the fallout over the international arena .
envoy included in mounting dead the attack , which took place at about 16:40 local time , brought down three floors of the concrete building , injuring many of those who were at work there and killing 17 , including the u.n. 's special representative to baghdad , sergio vieira de mello .
vieira de mello was trapped in the wreckage of the building long after the bomb struck ; his body was recovered by u.s. soldiers who rushed to the scene .
the u.n. building , a former hotel , had recently seen an increase in security before what u.s. officials at the scene believed to be a possible suicide attack by a person or persons in a large vehicle loaded with explosives .
eyewitnesses to the destruction said the main force of the explosion centered on the point of the building directly under vieira de mello 's office window .
a u.n. spokesman in baghdad , salim lone , made a statement soon after , calling the explosion " an unspeakable crime against people from all over the world who have come here to help the people of iraq . "
in new york , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan 's spokesman fred eckhard described the attack as " a tragedy , i think , not only personally but also a setback politically for the u.n. mission . "
loss felt throughout u.n.
" the loss of sergio vieira de mello is a bitter blow to the united nations and to me personally , " kofi annan said in a press conference .
" the death of any colleague is hard to bear , but i can think of no one we could less afford to spare than sergio . "
the united nations security council issued a statement saying : " this horrible attack , aimed at undermining the vital role of the u.n. in iraq , will not affect our determination .
we will stay united against such attacks and to help the iraqi people restore peace and stability to their country . "
enemies of the people president george w. bush told assembled members of the media at the white house , " the terrorists have again shown their contempt for the innocent , shown their fear of progress and hatred for peace .
they are the enemies of the people of iraq , the enemies of every nation that seeks to help the iraqi people . "
he added , " by their tactics and targets these murderers reveal themselves once more as enemies of the civilized world . "
the ramifications will not only stretch as far as the united nations and the organization 's efforts to aid the rebuilding of iraq and the return to normal life after years of sanctions and war but to the whole of the international community .
an act against the united nations could well be seen as a serious escalation of violence that could drag many world powers , including the european union , into a concerted diplomatic effort and , possibly , unwanted and messy military involvement .
the bombing is only the latest attack on non-military targets in iraq .
oil , water and electricity lines were attacked by what coalition spokesman called saboteurs over the weekend , while earlier this month , a car bomb exploded outside the jordanian embassy in baghdad , leaving 10 people dead . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

whereas previously the shootings and explosions carried out by unknown guerillas in the streets of the war-torn country have concentrated on the occupying forces , this latest targeting of the u.n. spreads the fallout over the international arena .
envoy included in mounting dead the attack , which took place at about 16:40 local time , brought down three floors of the concrete building , injuring many of those who were at work there and killing 17 , including the u.n. 's special representative to baghdad , sergio vieira de mello .
vieira de mello was trapped in the wreckage of the building long after the bomb struck ; his body was recovered by u.s. soldiers who rushed to the scene .
the u.n. building , a former hotel , had recently seen an increase in security before what u.s. officials at the scene believed to be a possible suicide attack by a person or persons in a large vehicle loaded with explosives .
eyewitnesses to the destruction said the main force of the explosion centered on the point of the building directly under vieira de mello 's office window .
a u.n. spokesman in baghdad , salim lone , made a statement soon after , calling the explosion " an unspeakable crime against people from all over the world who have come here to help the people of iraq . "
in new york , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan 's spokesman fred eckhard described the attack as " a tragedy , i think , not only personally but also a setback politically for the u.n. mission . "

" the loss of sergio vieira de mello is a bitter blow to the united nations and to me personally , " kofi annan said in a press conference .
" the death of any colleague is hard to bear , but i can think of no one we could less afford to spare than sergio . "
the united nations security council issued a statement saying : " this horrible attack , aimed at undermining the vital role of the u.n. in iraq , will not affect our determination .
we will stay united against such attacks and to help the iraqi people restore peace and stability to their country . "

the united states has formally asked the world trade organization to declare the eu ’ s refusal to import most genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- as illegal . backed by canada and argentina , the united states on monday pushed ahead with filing a formal complaint with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , requesting it to set up an arbitration panel to investigate the united states ' ongoing trade row with the european union .
the move marks the latest round in the lengthy transatlantic dispute sparked by the eu ’ s ban on the import of gm foods and grains and a mandatory labeling program introduced last month on gm food and animal feed .
it also raises the prospect of a fresh trade war ahead of crucial world trade talks in mexico .
though wto rules allow the eu , as the defendant , temporarily to block the move , the panel will automatically be formed when washington repeats its request at the next wto meeting on august 29 .
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy defended the eu ’ s stance .
" we regret this move to an unnecessary litigation , " he said in a statement .
" the eu ’ s regulatory system for gmos is clear , transparent , reasonable and non-discriminatory . "
lamy added he was confident the wto would overturn the u.s. complaint .
eu environment minister margot wallstrom warned the u.s. move could backfire .
" there should be no doubt that it is not our intention to create trade barriers .
but my concern is that this request will muddy the waters of the debate in europe .
we have to create confidence among citizens for gmos and then allow them to choose . "
u.s. hit by eu ban on gm imports the u.s. , the world leader in biotech crops , say its gm exports to the eu have been unfairly hit by a moratorium imposed by the bloc on farming and the import of gm food and grain in 1998 , with u.s. corn farmers complaining they lose about € 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
at the heart of the debate lie the eu ’ s safety concerns over gm technology , which prompted the moratorium in the first place .
officials and environmentalists in the 15-member bloc have repeatedly voiced concerns about the health risks and the risk to the environment posed by gm crops .
critics in the eu have also stressed that not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
washington however argues there is no scientific evidence pointing to human health or environmental problems related to biotech products and has urged the europeans to lift the ban .
in june , the war of words intensified when u.s. president george bush accused the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight because europe refused to accept gm crops , which often grow faster and are more disease-resistant than normal crops .
eu labeling program angers u.s. last month , in what was seen as a first step towards lifting the moratorium and easing trade relations with the united states , eu farm ministers approved new labeling regulations for biotech food that would eventually open up the european market to gm food .
the regulation , expected to come into force next spring , would apply to foodstuffs at every stage of production and would include all products that contain more than 0.9 percent of gmos .
producers would have six months to label their products accordingly .
the measure has been touted by the eu as restoring consumer confidence about the safety of gm products and on monday it also cited a survey conducted by u.s. television station abc in july which said 92 percent of the american public was in favor of biotech crop labeling .
it has however failed to win over the u.s. government , which complains its products would also have to be mandatorily tagged .
american farming organizations say being forced to use " gmo warning labels " on their products amounts to unfair trade barriers and involves high costs .
the latest spat over transatlantic biotech trade coincides with another potential trade dispute brewing between the europe and the united states , this time over the eu ’ s push for global brand protection of famous food such as gorgonzola and drinks like cognac .
though eu member states failed on monday to come up with a final list of its most well-known culinary treats , the united states has been upset with what it sees as europe ’ s insistence on using geographical labels as a means to restrict market access . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

u.s. hit by eu ban on gm imports the u.s. , the world leader in biotech crops , say its gm exports to the eu have been unfairly hit by a moratorium imposed by the bloc on farming and the import of gm food and grain in 1998 , with u.s. corn farmers complaining they lose about € 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
at the heart of the debate lie the eu ’ s safety concerns over gm technology , which prompted the moratorium in the first place .
officials and environmentalists in the 15-member bloc have repeatedly voiced concerns about the health risks and the risk to the environment posed by gm crops .
critics in the eu have also stressed that not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
washington however argues there is no scientific evidence pointing to human health or environmental problems related to biotech products and has urged the europeans to lift the ban .
in june , the war of words intensified when u.s. president george bush accused the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight because europe refused to accept gm crops , which often grow faster and are more disease-resistant than normal crops .
eu labeling program angers u.s. last month , in what was seen as a first step towards lifting the moratorium and easing trade relations with the united states , eu farm ministers approved new labeling regulations for biotech food that would eventually open up the european market to gm food .
the regulation , expected to come into force next spring , would apply to foodstuffs at every stage of production and would include all products that contain more than 0.9 percent of gmos .
producers would have six months to label their products accordingly .
the measure has been touted by the eu as restoring consumer confidence about the safety of gm products and on monday it also cited a survey conducted by u.s. television station abc in july which said 92 percent of the american public was in favor of biotech crop labeling .
it has however failed to win over the u.s. government , which complains its products would also have to be mandatorily tagged .
american farming organizations say being forced to use " gmo warning labels " on their products amounts to unfair trade barriers and involves high costs .
the latest spat over transatlantic biotech trade coincides with another potential trade dispute brewing between the europe and the united states , this time over the eu ’ s push for global brand protection of famous food such as gorgonzola and drinks like cognac .

the united states has formally asked the world trade organization to declare the eu ’ s refusal to import most genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- as illegal . backed by canada and argentina , the united states on monday pushed ahead with filing a formal complaint with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , requesting it to set up an arbitration panel to investigate the united states ' ongoing trade row with the european union .
the move marks the latest round in the lengthy transatlantic dispute sparked by the eu ’ s ban on the import of gm foods and grains and a mandatory labeling program introduced last month on gm food and animal feed .
it also raises the prospect of a fresh trade war ahead of crucial world trade talks in mexico .
though wto rules allow the eu , as the defendant , temporarily to block the move , the panel will automatically be formed when washington repeats its request at the next wto meeting on august 29 .
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy defended the eu ’ s stance .
" we regret this move to an unnecessary litigation , " he said in a statement .
" the eu ’ s regulatory system for gmos is clear , transparent , reasonable and non-discriminatory . "
lamy added he was confident the wto would overturn the u.s. complaint .

the german press on tuesday focused on allegations that the german government had paid ransom to secure the release of hostage in the sahara .
other papers concentrated on the ongoing pension reforms . the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- criticized this comment by the green party parliamentary speaker ludger volmer for saying , “ germany does not pay ransoms - and if it did , it wouldn ’ t admit it . ” the paper called his comments “ extraordinarily clumsy ” and said they indicated to potential kidnappers " that blackmailing the german government out of a few million euros is child ’ s play . ”
the ftd continued : “ the hostage takers have got what they wanted .
it ’ s no solution to let the local government buy them off and then transfer the money under the guise of development aid . ”
it went on to say volmer ’ s remark highlighted the government ’ s dilemma .
“ a state can not give in to the demands of bandits and terror groups , but at the same time it is responsible for every one of its citizens , and this responsibility doesn ’ t end at the german border . ”
the braunschweiger zeitung warned the end of the sahara hostages ’ ordeal didn ’ t mean germany had been given the all-clear ; rather quite the opposite .
it saw the likelihood that the german government has paid a ransom of possibly millions of euro , as an encouragement to terrorists all over the world to lie in wait for new victims .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung agreed .
“ the government shouldn ’ t let itself be blackmailed , certainly not by terrorists or greedy criminals , ” it wrote .
it also commented that questions would now be asked about the degree of responsibility on the part of the hostages themselves .
“ they travelled to a country not renowned for its safety , knowing that someone would come to their aid if the worst came to the worst , ” the paper wrote .
“ one could hold that against them , ” it said , “ but it would be better to do this behind closed doors . ”
several german papers however didn ’ t heed the faz ’ s warning to be discreet .
the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung asked why daredevil “ extreme ” tourists continued to ignore warnings about regional conflict zones crime and violent separatists .
“ the southern sahara has long been considered dangerous territory , ” the daily wrote , “ but for people looking for adventure , this is a kind of encouragement : it ’ s the warnings that make the area interesting . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.08.2003 17 dead as bombers hit u.n. headquarters in baghdad großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un envoy sergio vieira de mello was killed along with many others the devastating bombing of the united nations headquarters in baghdad on tuesday now threatens to drag the international community into a guerilla war that was until now mainly a coalition problem . the daily attacks on coalition forces in iraq took a dramatic and devastating turn on tuesday when a bomb ripped through the united nations headquarters in baghdad , killing at least 17 people , including the top u.n. envoy to iraq , and injuring at least 100 .
whereas previously the shootings and explosions carried out by unknown guerillas in the streets of the war-torn country have concentrated on the occupying forces , this latest targeting of the u.n. spreads the fallout over the international arena .
envoy included in mounting dead the attack , which took place at about 16:40 local time , brought down three floors of the concrete building , injuring many of those who were at work there and killing 17 , including the u.n. 's special representative to baghdad , sergio vieira de mello .
vieira de mello was trapped in the wreckage of the building long after the bomb struck ; his body was recovered by u.s. soldiers who rushed to the scene .
the u.n. building , a former hotel , had recently seen an increase in security before what u.s. officials at the scene believed to be a possible suicide attack by a person or persons in a large vehicle loaded with explosives .
eyewitnesses to the destruction said the main force of the explosion centered on the point of the building directly under vieira de mello 's office window .
a u.n. spokesman in baghdad , salim lone , made a statement soon after , calling the explosion " an unspeakable crime against people from all over the world who have come here to help the people of iraq . "
in new york , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan 's spokesman fred eckhard described the attack as " a tragedy , i think , not only personally but also a setback politically for the u.n. mission . "
loss felt throughout u.n.
" the loss of sergio vieira de mello is a bitter blow to the united nations and to me personally , " kofi annan said in a press conference .
" the death of any colleague is hard to bear , but i can think of no one we could less afford to spare than sergio . "
the united nations security council issued a statement saying : " this horrible attack , aimed at undermining the vital role of the u.n. in iraq , will not affect our determination .
we will stay united against such attacks and to help the iraqi people restore peace and stability to their country . "
enemies of the people president george w. bush told assembled members of the media at the white house , " the terrorists have again shown their contempt for the innocent , shown their fear of progress and hatred for peace .
they are the enemies of the people of iraq , the enemies of every nation that seeks to help the iraqi people . "
he added , " by their tactics and targets these murderers reveal themselves once more as enemies of the civilized world . "
the ramifications will not only stretch as far as the united nations and the organization 's efforts to aid the rebuilding of iraq and the return to normal life after years of sanctions and war but to the whole of the international community .
an act against the united nations could well be seen as a serious escalation of violence that could drag many world powers , including the european union , into a concerted diplomatic effort and , possibly , unwanted and messy military involvement .

whereas previously the shootings and explosions carried out by unknown guerillas in the streets of the war-torn country have concentrated on the occupying forces , this latest targeting of the u.n. spreads the fallout over the international arena .
envoy included in mounting dead the attack , which took place at about 16:40 local time , brought down three floors of the concrete building , injuring many of those who were at work there and killing 17 , including the u.n. 's special representative to baghdad , sergio vieira de mello .
vieira de mello was trapped in the wreckage of the building long after the bomb struck ; his body was recovered by u.s. soldiers who rushed to the scene .
the u.n. building , a former hotel , had recently seen an increase in security before what u.s. officials at the scene believed to be a possible suicide attack by a person or persons in a large vehicle loaded with explosives .
eyewitnesses to the destruction said the main force of the explosion centered on the point of the building directly under vieira de mello 's office window .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 19.08.2003 sahara hostages freed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german military plane in mali waits to bring the hostages back to germany .
fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .
the group is expected to leave for germany on tuesday . german and malian authorities have confirmed that the fourteen european tourists , kidnapped by an islamic outfit in north africa for almost six months , are free and safe .
the german foreign ministry said late monday evening the group , which include nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were freed by their kidnappers near the city of tessalit in northern mali .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , a key official in the negotiating process , praised the malian authorities for their cooperation .
" this was great negotiating skill by the mali president -lrb- amadou toumani toure -rrb- , " chrobog told a german television station from the malian capital of bamako .
" the president confirmed to me that all the hostages are well .
so that is also a relief , it seems that no one has been hurt , " chrobog added .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said chrobog had told him the freed hostages were in the care of german authorities in mali on tuesday evening .
schröder commended the cooperation with the algerian and malian authorities and offered the countries help in apprehending the kidnappers and in combating terrorism .
the hostages are believed to be heading towards the east malian town of gao in an auto convoy , from where they are expected to be airlifted by an airplane belonging to the german armed forces equipped with doctors and paramedics .
one of the hostages has reportedly spoken to chrobog on the telephone and assured him that the group was in good health .
the group will be brought to bamako and flown to the cologne airport after a meeting with the malian president .
no news on ransom payment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hostages will soon be on their way home .
the 14 were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while travelling in southern algeria .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages , by killing their kidnappers belonging to the islamist outfit , salafist group for preaching and combat .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 .
after the shootout , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month .
german and malian negotiators have been in contact with the kidnappers , who according to german media reports , want $ 5 million for each hostage , though it hasn ’ t been confirmed by the authorities .
however it remains unclear whether any ransom was paid .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday that the efforts to secure the release of the hostages had been " extremely difficult and delicate " right from the beginning .
he however underlined the german government ’ s position to refuse to pay any ransom .
malian officials said last week that kidnappers had demanded a ransom , but that the impoverished country could not pay it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first hostages home await the return of their companions .
dutch foreign minister jaap de hoop scheffer said in an interview with a dutch television station on monday he couldn ’ t confirm whether any ransom had been paid .
" you know that dutch policy is , and will always be , not to pay ransoms when dutch nationals are abducted . "
the minister added , " there was close cooperation with germany , whose nationals made up most of the hostages , and with the netherlands and switzerland .
germany obviously played first fiddle . "
on monday there were conflicting reports about the release of the hostages .
the handing over of the hostages to malian negotiators was delayed apparently after storms and rain hampered the transport of the hostages to the designated location for the hand over .
" hostages should pay for release " in germany meanwhile a debate has already broken out on the apparent foolhardiness of the tourists traveling to a dangerous region without adequate preparations .
parliamentary leader of the conservative opposition of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach has demanded that kidnapped tourists should in certain cases shoulder a share of the costs involved in securing their release .
" those who get themselves in danger through their own frivolity and for the thrill of it , should reckon on with paying for their release , " bosbach told the financial times deutschland .
the minister also criticized that tourists often ignored travel warnings issued by the foreign ministry . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

mayor ole von beust fired ronald schill after the former judge allegedly threatened to out him . hamburg mayor ole von beust fired the city-state 's controversial interior minister on tuesday .
he said that ' law and order ' man ronald schill had threatened to publicly out beust as a homosexual .
" i have dismissed mr. schill , " beust told reporters .
" i felt forced to dismiss him because schill 's character is not suited to the office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust .
the two men had met to discuss schill 's deputy walter wellinghausen , who beust -lrb- picture -rrb- also dismissed .
wellinghausen , who had been schill 's attorney , has been accused of illegally continuing to collect pay in another capacity after he became privy counselor .
according to beust , schill said the mayor had made his ostensible partner his justice minister and that the two had a homosexual relationship .
" the end of a nightmare " relief was apparent after schill 's sacking was announced .
" for the police , it 's the end of a nightmare , " the head of the police trade union , konrad freiberg , said .
" the dgb emphatically welcomes the fact that ole von beust dismissed interior minister schill and his privy counsel wellinghausen , " german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- regional head erhard pumm announced .
even representatives from schill 's coalition partner , the free democratic party , expressed relief , " we have absolutely no sympathy for mr. schill 's behavior .
we consider mayor von beust 's actions appropriate . "
although ronald barnabas schill disputed beust 's accusations , he said he now wished to retire from politics .
hamburg 's haider the dismissal may mark the end of a short but dramatic career in politics for the hamburg judge .
" judge merciless , " as the german media dubbed him , first drew nationwide attention for the draconic sentences he handed down in the hamburg court he presided over .
the " law-and-order " man formed his own political party , the schill party in july 2000 and campaigned in the september 2001 hamburg elections .
at the same time as fending off comparisons to austria 's rightwing politician jörg haider , schill called for sex offenders to be castrated , suspected drug dealers to be fed emetics to retrieve evidence and convicted foreigners to be deported .
throughout the campaign he was haunted by the three-day jail sentence he had imposed on the two young men in 1999 for disturbing court proceedings .
a hamburg court had already convicted schill of false imprisonment and perversion of justice based on accusations that he delayed a complaint made by the men .
but schill 's hardline appealed to the hamburg electorate .
his party earned 19.4 percent of the votes in the traditionally social democratic city , 25 of the 121 mandates .
suddenly the schill party had the chance to make-up part of the city 's ruling coalition , which after more than three weeks of talks it did , along with the christian democrats and the free democrats .
schill was named interior minister and deputy mayor , while two other party members headed up hamburg ministries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schill gave hamburg cops a makeover .
schill 's first 100 days in office , starting on october 31 , 2001 , were overshadowed by accusations that the senator used cocaine and the furore surrounding the expensive uniforms he ordered to make hamburg 's police look " nicer . "
he submitted hair for a drug test that cleared him of the drug-taking charges .
schill was acquitted of false imprisonment and perversion of justice in december 2001 .
schill , the court said " objectively " perverted justice , but not on purpose , and he had lied .
hours later schill named his defense attorney , walter wellinghausen , privy counselor in the interior ministry .
uproar in parliament the national spotlight turned to schill again in late august 2002 when he addressed the german parliament during a discussion of aid for flooded german regions .
schill used the opportunity to accuse the german governments of the past years of " total failure . "
twice schill 's microphone was turned off after he refused to bring his rant to an end .
across the political spectrum german politicians and the media were scandalized by schill 's behavior .
" this is the last time that such a thing will happen , " hamburg mayor beust announced in response .
beust has been as good as his word , despite the risk that it could have meant the end for his three-way coalition .
so far though , the ruling coalition is standing firm .
after a meeting on tuesday the three parties announced that their cooperation would continue uninterrupted .
schill party chairman mario mettbach said the disgraced interior minister 's predecessor will be named by friday .
the hamburg district attorney is investigating whether to take legal action against schill for coercion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

military and humanitarian aid should be separate , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces to protect civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .
first the military enters , then the aid organizations follow up with their humanitarian assistance ; the two tasks can not be combined . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the three germans , astrid bouteil , dyrk and david hesshaimer who say lindbergh is their father , claim the pilot also had a clandestine relationship with their mother , brigitte hessheimer from munich , who he visited regularly under the pseudonym careu kent .
they have now announced they want to take genetic tests to prove it . love letters in the attic it all began back in the 1980s when the middle child , astrid bouteil , began investigating the life of the mysterious man she knew as her father , a man who would stay with the hessheimers regularly but never for more than two weeks .
in the family attic , bouteil , who now lives in paris , the city in which lindbergh landed after traversing the atlantic on his legendary solo flight , found 112 letters allegedly written by lindbergh to her mother , brigitte hessheimer .
on confronting her mother with the letters , hessheimer was said to have burst into tears .
the children promised to keep the secret until both their mother and lindbergh 's wife had deceased . bouteil and her two brothers support their case with pictures of lindbergh and his second family in munich and their own faces which bear a remarkable likeness to the pilot .
all three insist they have no interest in lindbergh 's estate or legacy but that they only wish to set the record straight .
" to discover your own identity is a fundamental desire of every person . "
astrid bouteil told the süddeutsche zeitung , which first reported on the case earlier this month .
" deep down everyone wants to know who their father is . " the three germans say they spent little time with their father , but that the moments they had with him were particularly intensive .
all three can remember details such as how lindbergh wriggled his ears or his shoes , which were so big , that the children put puppets in them at night . " hauntingly familiar " however , the germans allegations have also been met with skepticism , in particular in the united states .
here , at least a dozen men have claimed in the past to be lindbergh 's first son , believed to have been murdered as a baby back in 1932 .
marlene white , executive director of the lindbergh foundation , whose president is lindbergh 's daughter reeve , told stern magazine the family refused to comment .
" it is not the first time that people claim charles lindbergh is their father " . but an american grandson of lindbergh has said he thought it could be possible that the germans were telling the truth as they looked so " hauntingly familiar . "
he has now declared he will take up the germans ' offer to go through with dna tests , and will submit to one himself . " i 'm not speaking for the lindbergh family but only for myself - i believe it is possible -lrb- they are the lindbergh children -rrb- , " morgan lindbergh , whose father jon , was the second child of charles and anne morrow lindbergh , told reuters in a telephone interview . a. scott berg , author of a prize-winning biography of lindbergh , said the story was possible but unlikely .
" i 'm happy to believe that their mother told them charles lindbergh was their father , " berg said in an interview with stern magazine .
" i do n't know anything about this woman 's state .
it certainly was n't easy to raise three children in the 1950s without a father . " ties to goering lindbergh came to fame as the first person to fly alone across the atlantic , from new york to paris , in 1927 .
during the 33-hour-long flight , people across the world followed his trip on the radio , while the united states played the french national anthem on his arrival in paris . his widespread popularity was overshadowed by lindbergh 's pre-war sympathy for nazi germany and ties with luftwaffe leader hermann goering , but he later changed his views and was largely rehabilitated . linbergh met brigitte hessheimer , a munich hat maker , in 1957 .
lindbergh allegedly spent up to two weeks three times a year in munich until 1974 .
weakened by cancer , lindbergh 's last visit was in 1973 , one year before his death .
" i 'm losing strength every day " , he wrote in his last letter to hessheimer .
" it 's hard for me to write .

mayor ole von beust fired ronald schill after the former judge allegedly threatened to out him . hamburg mayor ole von beust fired the city-state 's controversial interior minister on tuesday .
he said that ' law and order ' man ronald schill had threatened to publicly out beust as a homosexual .
" i have dismissed mr. schill , " beust told reporters .
" i felt forced to dismiss him because schill 's character is not suited to the office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust .
the two men had met to discuss schill 's deputy walter wellinghausen , who beust -lrb- picture -rrb- also dismissed .
wellinghausen , who had been schill 's attorney , has been accused of illegally continuing to collect pay in another capacity after he became privy counselor .
according to beust , schill said the mayor had made his ostensible partner his justice minister and that the two had a homosexual relationship .
" the end of a nightmare " relief was apparent after schill 's sacking was announced .
" for the police , it 's the end of a nightmare , " the head of the police trade union , konrad freiberg , said .
" the dgb emphatically welcomes the fact that ole von beust dismissed interior minister schill and his privy counsel wellinghausen , " german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- regional head erhard pumm announced .
even representatives from schill 's coalition partner , the free democratic party , expressed relief , " we have absolutely no sympathy for mr. schill 's behavior .
we consider mayor von beust 's actions appropriate . "
although ronald barnabas schill disputed beust 's accusations , he said he now wished to retire from politics .
hamburg 's haider the dismissal may mark the end of a short but dramatic career in politics for the hamburg judge .
" judge merciless , " as the german media dubbed him , first drew nationwide attention for the draconic sentences he handed down in the hamburg court he presided over .
the " law-and-order " man formed his own political party , the schill party in july 2000 and campaigned in the september 2001 hamburg elections .
at the same time as fending off comparisons to austria 's rightwing politician jörg haider , schill called for sex offenders to be castrated , suspected drug dealers to be fed emetics to retrieve evidence and convicted foreigners to be deported .
throughout the campaign he was haunted by the three-day jail sentence he had imposed on the two young men in 1999 for disturbing court proceedings .
a hamburg court had already convicted schill of false imprisonment and perversion of justice based on accusations that he delayed a complaint made by the men .
but schill 's hardline appealed to the hamburg electorate .
his party earned 19.4 percent of the votes in the traditionally social democratic city , 25 of the 121 mandates .
suddenly the schill party had the chance to make-up part of the city 's ruling coalition , which after more than three weeks of talks it did , along with the christian democrats and the free democrats .
schill was named interior minister and deputy mayor , while two other party members headed up hamburg ministries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schill gave hamburg cops a makeover .
schill 's first 100 days in office , starting on october 31 , 2001 , were overshadowed by accusations that the senator used cocaine and the furore surrounding the expensive uniforms he ordered to make hamburg 's police look " nicer . "
he submitted hair for a drug test that cleared him of the drug-taking charges .
schill was acquitted of false imprisonment and perversion of justice in december 2001 .
schill , the court said " objectively " perverted justice , but not on purpose , and he had lied .
hours later schill named his defense attorney , walter wellinghausen , privy counselor in the interior ministry .
uproar in parliament the national spotlight turned to schill again in late august 2002 when he addressed the german parliament during a discussion of aid for flooded german regions .
schill used the opportunity to accuse the german governments of the past years of " total failure . "
twice schill 's microphone was turned off after he refused to bring his rant to an end .
across the political spectrum german politicians and the media were scandalized by schill 's behavior .
" this is the last time that such a thing will happen , " hamburg mayor beust announced in response .
beust has been as good as his word , despite the risk that it could have meant the end for his three-way coalition .
so far though , the ruling coalition is standing firm .
after a meeting on tuesday the three parties announced that their cooperation would continue uninterrupted .

the united states has formally asked the world trade organization to declare the eu ’ s refusal to import most genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- as illegal . backed by canada and argentina , the united states on monday pushed ahead with filing a formal complaint with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , requesting it to set up an arbitration panel to investigate the united states ' ongoing trade row with the european union .
the move marks the latest round in the lengthy transatlantic dispute sparked by the eu ’ s ban on the import of gm foods and grains and a mandatory labeling program introduced last month on gm food and animal feed .
it also raises the prospect of a fresh trade war ahead of crucial world trade talks in mexico .
though wto rules allow the eu , as the defendant , temporarily to block the move , the panel will automatically be formed when washington repeats its request at the next wto meeting on august 29 .
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy defended the eu ’ s stance .
" we regret this move to an unnecessary litigation , " he said in a statement .
" the eu ’ s regulatory system for gmos is clear , transparent , reasonable and non-discriminatory . "
lamy added he was confident the wto would overturn the u.s. complaint .
eu environment minister margot wallstrom warned the u.s. move could backfire .
" there should be no doubt that it is not our intention to create trade barriers .
but my concern is that this request will muddy the waters of the debate in europe .
we have to create confidence among citizens for gmos and then allow them to choose . "
u.s. hit by eu ban on gm imports the u.s. , the world leader in biotech crops , say its gm exports to the eu have been unfairly hit by a moratorium imposed by the bloc on farming and the import of gm food and grain in 1998 , with u.s. corn farmers complaining they lose about € 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
at the heart of the debate lie the eu ’ s safety concerns over gm technology , which prompted the moratorium in the first place .
officials and environmentalists in the 15-member bloc have repeatedly voiced concerns about the health risks and the risk to the environment posed by gm crops .
critics in the eu have also stressed that not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
washington however argues there is no scientific evidence pointing to human health or environmental problems related to biotech products and has urged the europeans to lift the ban .
in june , the war of words intensified when u.s. president george bush accused the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight because europe refused to accept gm crops , which often grow faster and are more disease-resistant than normal crops .
eu labeling program angers u.s. last month , in what was seen as a first step towards lifting the moratorium and easing trade relations with the united states , eu farm ministers approved new labeling regulations for biotech food that would eventually open up the european market to gm food .
the regulation , expected to come into force next spring , would apply to foodstuffs at every stage of production and would include all products that contain more than 0.9 percent of gmos .
producers would have six months to label their products accordingly .
the measure has been touted by the eu as restoring consumer confidence about the safety of gm products and on monday it also cited a survey conducted by u.s. television station abc in july which said 92 percent of the american public was in favor of biotech crop labeling .
it has however failed to win over the u.s. government , which complains its products would also have to be mandatorily tagged .
american farming organizations say being forced to use " gmo warning labels " on their products amounts to unfair trade barriers and involves high costs .
the latest spat over transatlantic biotech trade coincides with another potential trade dispute brewing between the europe and the united states , this time over the eu ’ s push for global brand protection of famous food such as gorgonzola and drinks like cognac .
though eu member states failed on monday to come up with a final list of its most well-known culinary treats , the united states has been upset with what it sees as europe ’ s insistence on using geographical labels as a means to restrict market access . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

africa , europe , the middle east - lindbergh was , apart from a world-famous pilot , an enthusiastic driver .
two weeks ago , three germans announced they , too , had spent time in that very same car with charles lindbergh - who they now claim is their father . the news came both as a surprise , both to the lindbergh museum in little falls , minnesota and lindbergh 's legitimate family in the united states .
there , lindbergh was married to writer anne morrow , with whom he had six children .
the three germans , astrid bouteil , dyrk and david hesshaimer who say lindbergh is their father , claim the pilot also had a clandestine relationship with their mother , brigitte hessheimer from munich , who he visited regularly under the pseudonym careu kent .
they have now announced they want to take genetic tests to prove it . love letters in the attic it all began back in the 1980s when the middle child , astrid bouteil , began investigating the life of the mysterious man she knew as her father , a man who would stay with the hessheimers regularly but never for more than two weeks .
in the family attic , bouteil , who now lives in paris , the city in which lindbergh landed after traversing the atlantic on his legendary solo flight , found 112 letters allegedly written by lindbergh to her mother , brigitte hessheimer .
on confronting her mother with the letters , hessheimer was said to have burst into tears .
the children promised to keep the secret until both their mother and lindbergh 's wife had deceased . bouteil and her two brothers support their case with pictures of lindbergh and his second family in munich and their own faces which bear a remarkable likeness to the pilot .
all three insist they have no interest in lindbergh 's estate or legacy but that they only wish to set the record straight .
" to discover your own identity is a fundamental desire of every person . "
astrid bouteil told the süddeutsche zeitung , which first reported on the case earlier this month .
" deep down everyone wants to know who their father is . " the three germans say they spent little time with their father , but that the moments they had with him were particularly intensive .
all three can remember details such as how lindbergh wriggled his ears or his shoes , which were so big , that the children put puppets in them at night . " hauntingly familiar " however , the germans allegations have also been met with skepticism , in particular in the united states .
here , at least a dozen men have claimed in the past to be lindbergh 's first son , believed to have been murdered as a baby back in 1932 .
marlene white , executive director of the lindbergh foundation , whose president is lindbergh 's daughter reeve , told stern magazine the family refused to comment .
" it is not the first time that people claim charles lindbergh is their father " . but an american grandson of lindbergh has said he thought it could be possible that the germans were telling the truth as they looked so " hauntingly familiar . "
he has now declared he will take up the germans ' offer to go through with dna tests , and will submit to one himself . " i 'm not speaking for the lindbergh family but only for myself - i believe it is possible -lrb- they are the lindbergh children -rrb- , " morgan lindbergh , whose father jon , was the second child of charles and anne morrow lindbergh , told reuters in a telephone interview . a. scott berg , author of a prize-winning biography of lindbergh , said the story was possible but unlikely .
" i 'm happy to believe that their mother told them charles lindbergh was their father , " berg said in an interview with stern magazine .
" i do n't know anything about this woman 's state .
it certainly was n't easy to raise three children in the 1950s without a father . " ties to goering lindbergh came to fame as the first person to fly alone across the atlantic , from new york to paris , in 1927 .
during the 33-hour-long flight , people across the world followed his trip on the radio , while the united states played the french national anthem on his arrival in paris . his widespread popularity was overshadowed by lindbergh 's pre-war sympathy for nazi germany and ties with luftwaffe leader hermann goering , but he later changed his views and was largely rehabilitated . linbergh met brigitte hessheimer , a munich hat maker , in 1957 .
lindbergh allegedly spent up to two weeks three times a year in munich until 1974 .
weakened by cancer , lindbergh 's last visit was in 1973 , one year before his death .
" i 'm losing strength every day " , he wrote in his last letter to hessheimer .
" it 's hard for me to write .

the german press on tuesday focused on allegations that the german government had paid ransom to secure the release of hostage in the sahara .
other papers concentrated on the ongoing pension reforms . the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- criticized this comment by the green party parliamentary speaker ludger volmer for saying , “ germany does not pay ransoms - and if it did , it wouldn ’ t admit it . ” the paper called his comments “ extraordinarily clumsy ” and said they indicated to potential kidnappers " that blackmailing the german government out of a few million euros is child ’ s play . ”
the ftd continued : “ the hostage takers have got what they wanted .
it ’ s no solution to let the local government buy them off and then transfer the money under the guise of development aid . ”
it went on to say volmer ’ s remark highlighted the government ’ s dilemma .
“ a state can not give in to the demands of bandits and terror groups , but at the same time it is responsible for every one of its citizens , and this responsibility doesn ’ t end at the german border . ”
the braunschweiger zeitung warned the end of the sahara hostages ’ ordeal didn ’ t mean germany had been given the all-clear ; rather quite the opposite .
it saw the likelihood that the german government has paid a ransom of possibly millions of euro , as an encouragement to terrorists all over the world to lie in wait for new victims .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung agreed .
“ the government shouldn ’ t let itself be blackmailed , certainly not by terrorists or greedy criminals , ” it wrote .
it also commented that questions would now be asked about the degree of responsibility on the part of the hostages themselves .
“ they travelled to a country not renowned for its safety , knowing that someone would come to their aid if the worst came to the worst , ” the paper wrote .
“ one could hold that against them , ” it said , “ but it would be better to do this behind closed doors . ”
several german papers however didn ’ t heed the faz ’ s warning to be discreet .
the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung asked why daredevil “ extreme ” tourists continued to ignore warnings about regional conflict zones crime and violent separatists .
“ the southern sahara has long been considered dangerous territory , ” the daily wrote , “ but for people looking for adventure , this is a kind of encouragement : it ’ s the warnings that make the area interesting . ”

military and humanitarian aid should be separate , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces to protect civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .

the munich-based paper concluded that the third world ’ s struggle for survival was not compatible with the need rich societies had for fun .
dresden ’ s sächsische zeitung turned to the debate over pension reform in germany and recalled the infamous words of former labor minister norbert blüm that pensions are secure .
“ however , ” the paper wrote , “ this statement now only applies to the pensions of politicians and civil servants . ”
the kölner stadt-anzeiger thought it inevitable that today ’ s employees must make more private provisions for their pensions than at present if contributions to the pension system were to remain stable and a slide into poverty in old age avoided .
at the same time , the paper said , there must be an end to the practice of adapting pension payments to the economic situation .
“ people have a right to reliability , all the more so because pensions will fall reliably , ” the cologne-based paper wrote . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

military and humanitarian aid should be separate , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces to protect civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .

fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .
the group is expected to leave for germany on tuesday . german and malian authorities have confirmed that the fourteen european tourists , kidnapped by an islamic outfit in north africa for almost six months , are free and safe .
the german foreign ministry said late monday evening the group , which include nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were freed by their kidnappers near the city of tessalit in northern mali .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , a key official in the negotiating process , praised the malian authorities for their cooperation .
" this was great negotiating skill by the mali president -lrb- amadou toumani toure -rrb- , " chrobog told a german television station from the malian capital of bamako .
" the president confirmed to me that all the hostages are well .
so that is also a relief , it seems that no one has been hurt , " chrobog added .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said chrobog had told him the freed hostages were in the care of german authorities in mali on tuesday evening .
schröder commended the cooperation with the algerian and malian authorities and offered the countries help in apprehending the kidnappers and in combating terrorism .
the hostages are believed to be heading towards the east malian town of gao in an auto convoy , from where they are expected to be airlifted by an airplane belonging to the german armed forces equipped with doctors and paramedics .
one of the hostages has reportedly spoken to chrobog on the telephone and assured him that the group was in good health .
the group will be brought to bamako and flown to the cologne airport after a meeting with the malian president .
no news on ransom payment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hostages will soon be on their way home .
the 14 were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while travelling in southern algeria .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages , by killing their kidnappers belonging to the islamist outfit , salafist group for preaching and combat .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 .
after the shootout , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month .
german and malian negotiators have been in contact with the kidnappers , who according to german media reports , want $ 5 million for each hostage , though it hasn ’ t been confirmed by the authorities .
however it remains unclear whether any ransom was paid .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday that the efforts to secure the release of the hostages had been " extremely difficult and delicate " right from the beginning .
he however underlined the german government ’ s position to refuse to pay any ransom .
malian officials said last week that kidnappers had demanded a ransom , but that the impoverished country could not pay it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first hostages home await the return of their companions .
dutch foreign minister jaap de hoop scheffer said in an interview with a dutch television station on monday he couldn ’ t confirm whether any ransom had been paid .
" you know that dutch policy is , and will always be , not to pay ransoms when dutch nationals are abducted . "
the minister added , " there was close cooperation with germany , whose nationals made up most of the hostages , and with the netherlands and switzerland .
germany obviously played first fiddle . "
on monday there were conflicting reports about the release of the hostages .
the handing over of the hostages to malian negotiators was delayed apparently after storms and rain hampered the transport of the hostages to the designated location for the hand over .
" hostages should pay for release " in germany meanwhile a debate has already broken out on the apparent foolhardiness of the tourists traveling to a dangerous region without adequate preparations .
parliamentary leader of the conservative opposition of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach has demanded that kidnapped tourists should in certain cases shoulder a share of the costs involved in securing their release .
" those who get themselves in danger through their own frivolity and for the thrill of it , should reckon on with paying for their release , " bosbach told the financial times deutschland .
the minister also criticized that tourists often ignored travel warnings issued by the foreign ministry . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .
the group is expected to leave for germany on tuesday . german and malian authorities have confirmed that the fourteen european tourists , kidnapped by an islamic outfit in north africa for almost six months , are free and safe .
the german foreign ministry said late monday evening the group , which include nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were freed by their kidnappers near the city of tessalit in northern mali .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , a key official in the negotiating process , praised the malian authorities for their cooperation .
" this was great negotiating skill by the mali president -lrb- amadou toumani toure -rrb- , " chrobog told a german television station from the malian capital of bamako .
" the president confirmed to me that all the hostages are well .
so that is also a relief , it seems that no one has been hurt , " chrobog added .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said chrobog had told him the freed hostages were in the care of german authorities in mali on tuesday evening .
schröder commended the cooperation with the algerian and malian authorities and offered the countries help in apprehending the kidnappers and in combating terrorism .
the hostages are believed to be heading towards the east malian town of gao in an auto convoy , from where they are expected to be airlifted by an airplane belonging to the german armed forces equipped with doctors and paramedics .

german foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday that the efforts to secure the release of the hostages had been " extremely difficult and delicate " right from the beginning .

now , to prove their case , they have announced they will take dna tests . the car , an old , rusty vw beetle , stands close to the museum .
a small information board next to it explains how the car 's owner , charles lindbergh , used it to travel the world .
africa , europe , the middle east - lindbergh was , apart from a world-famous pilot , an enthusiastic driver .
two weeks ago , three germans announced they , too , had spent time in that very same car with charles lindbergh - who they now claim is their father . the news came both as a surprise , both to the lindbergh museum in little falls , minnesota and lindbergh 's legitimate family in the united states .
there , lindbergh was married to writer anne morrow , with whom he had six children .
the three germans , astrid bouteil , dyrk and david hesshaimer who say lindbergh is their father , claim the pilot also had a clandestine relationship with their mother , brigitte hessheimer from munich , who he visited regularly under the pseudonym careu kent .
they have now announced they want to take genetic tests to prove it . love letters in the attic it all began back in the 1980s when the middle child , astrid bouteil , began investigating the life of the mysterious man she knew as her father , a man who would stay with the hessheimers regularly but never for more than two weeks .
in the family attic , bouteil , who now lives in paris , the city in which lindbergh landed after traversing the atlantic on his legendary solo flight , found 112 letters allegedly written by lindbergh to her mother , brigitte hessheimer .
on confronting her mother with the letters , hessheimer was said to have burst into tears .
the children promised to keep the secret until both their mother and lindbergh 's wife had deceased . bouteil and her two brothers support their case with pictures of lindbergh and his second family in munich and their own faces which bear a remarkable likeness to the pilot .
all three insist they have no interest in lindbergh 's estate or legacy but that they only wish to set the record straight .
" to discover your own identity is a fundamental desire of every person . "
astrid bouteil told the süddeutsche zeitung , which first reported on the case earlier this month .
" deep down everyone wants to know who their father is . " the three germans say they spent little time with their father , but that the moments they had with him were particularly intensive .
all three can remember details such as how lindbergh wriggled his ears or his shoes , which were so big , that the children put puppets in them at night . " hauntingly familiar " however , the germans allegations have also been met with skepticism , in particular in the united states .
here , at least a dozen men have claimed in the past to be lindbergh 's first son , believed to have been murdered as a baby back in 1932 .
marlene white , executive director of the lindbergh foundation , whose president is lindbergh 's daughter reeve , told stern magazine the family refused to comment .
" it is not the first time that people claim charles lindbergh is their father " . but an american grandson of lindbergh has said he thought it could be possible that the germans were telling the truth as they looked so " hauntingly familiar . "
he has now declared he will take up the germans ' offer to go through with dna tests , and will submit to one himself . " i 'm not speaking for the lindbergh family but only for myself - i believe it is possible -lrb- they are the lindbergh children -rrb- , " morgan lindbergh , whose father jon , was the second child of charles and anne morrow lindbergh , told reuters in a telephone interview . a. scott berg , author of a prize-winning biography of lindbergh , said the story was possible but unlikely .
" i 'm happy to believe that their mother told them charles lindbergh was their father , " berg said in an interview with stern magazine .
" i do n't know anything about this woman 's state .
it certainly was n't easy to raise three children in the 1950s without a father . " ties to goering lindbergh came to fame as the first person to fly alone across the atlantic , from new york to paris , in 1927 .
during the 33-hour-long flight , people across the world followed his trip on the radio , while the united states played the french national anthem on his arrival in paris . his widespread popularity was overshadowed by lindbergh 's pre-war sympathy for nazi germany and ties with luftwaffe leader hermann goering , but he later changed his views and was largely rehabilitated . linbergh met brigitte hessheimer , a munich hat maker , in 1957 .
lindbergh allegedly spent up to two weeks three times a year in munich until 1974 .
weakened by cancer , lindbergh 's last visit was in 1973 , one year before his death .
" i 'm losing strength every day " , he wrote in his last letter to hessheimer .

two weeks ago , three germans announced they , too , had spent time in that very same car with charles lindbergh - who they now claim is their father . the news came both as a surprise , both to the lindbergh museum in little falls , minnesota and lindbergh 's legitimate family in the united states .
there , lindbergh was married to writer anne morrow , with whom he had six children .
the three germans , astrid bouteil , dyrk and david hesshaimer who say lindbergh is their father , claim the pilot also had a clandestine relationship with their mother , brigitte hessheimer from munich , who he visited regularly under the pseudonym careu kent .
they have now announced they want to take genetic tests to prove it . love letters in the attic it all began back in the 1980s when the middle child , astrid bouteil , began investigating the life of the mysterious man she knew as her father , a man who would stay with the hessheimers regularly but never for more than two weeks .
in the family attic , bouteil , who now lives in paris , the city in which lindbergh landed after traversing the atlantic on his legendary solo flight , found 112 letters allegedly written by lindbergh to her mother , brigitte hessheimer .
on confronting her mother with the letters , hessheimer was said to have burst into tears .
the children promised to keep the secret until both their mother and lindbergh 's wife had deceased . bouteil and her two brothers support their case with pictures of lindbergh and his second family in munich and their own faces which bear a remarkable likeness to the pilot .
all three insist they have no interest in lindbergh 's estate or legacy but that they only wish to set the record straight .
" to discover your own identity is a fundamental desire of every person . "
astrid bouteil told the süddeutsche zeitung , which first reported on the case earlier this month .
" deep down everyone wants to know who their father is . " the three germans say they spent little time with their father , but that the moments they had with him were particularly intensive .
all three can remember details such as how lindbergh wriggled his ears or his shoes , which were so big , that the children put puppets in them at night . " hauntingly familiar " however , the germans allegations have also been met with skepticism , in particular in the united states .
here , at least a dozen men have claimed in the past to be lindbergh 's first son , believed to have been murdered as a baby back in 1932 .
marlene white , executive director of the lindbergh foundation , whose president is lindbergh 's daughter reeve , told stern magazine the family refused to comment .
" it is not the first time that people claim charles lindbergh is their father " . but an american grandson of lindbergh has said he thought it could be possible that the germans were telling the truth as they looked so " hauntingly familiar . "
he has now declared he will take up the germans ' offer to go through with dna tests , and will submit to one himself . " i 'm not speaking for the lindbergh family but only for myself - i believe it is possible -lrb- they are the lindbergh children -rrb- , " morgan lindbergh , whose father jon , was the second child of charles and anne morrow lindbergh , told reuters in a telephone interview . a. scott berg , author of a prize-winning biography of lindbergh , said the story was possible but unlikely .
" i 'm happy to believe that their mother told them charles lindbergh was their father , " berg said in an interview with stern magazine .
" i do n't know anything about this woman 's state .
it certainly was n't easy to raise three children in the 1950s without a father . " ties to goering lindbergh came to fame as the first person to fly alone across the atlantic , from new york to paris , in 1927 .
during the 33-hour-long flight , people across the world followed his trip on the radio , while the united states played the french national anthem on his arrival in paris . his widespread popularity was overshadowed by lindbergh 's pre-war sympathy for nazi germany and ties with luftwaffe leader hermann goering , but he later changed his views and was largely rehabilitated . linbergh met brigitte hessheimer , a munich hat maker , in 1957 .
lindbergh allegedly spent up to two weeks three times a year in munich until 1974 .
weakened by cancer , lindbergh 's last visit was in 1973 , one year before his death .
" i 'm losing strength every day " , he wrote in his last letter to hessheimer .

schools in three states are offering muslim students a chance to learn about their faith in the german language instead of in their mother tongue , in a move that ’ s hoped to contribute towards better integration . as schools in germany get ready to welcome back students after six long weeks of summer vacation , a few in berlin , lower saxony and bavaria feature a new subject on their curriculum - islamic education .
the idea isn ’ t exactly new .
in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .
but germany ’ s complex federal system of education , whereby education remains a prerogative of the länder or states , has meant that the proposal couldn ’ t be applied across the board .
the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .
" contributing towards integration and tolerance " the number of states offering islamic education in german has been growing gradually .
the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to 800,000 muslims , has sponsored optional islamic religion instruction classes as a sort of test run in 24 schools since 1999 . last year , in a rare move , berlin , lower saxony and bavaria committed themselves to introducing concrete islamic education in the german language in close cooperation with islamic organizations in the country .
while berlin got off to a head start with the subject already offered in around 20 schools and now being extended to 30 this week , lower saxony and bavaria are treading new ground with it .
mr. weszling , a spokesman at the education ministry in lower saxony , home to about 40,000 muslim students , told deutsche welle the model was initially being tested on eight primary schools in the state and had been hammered out together with islamic organizations .
" the parents will decide whether they want to send their children to the class , " he said , but added " we ’ re hoping it will contribute towards integration , tolerance and more understanding of the religion . "
the classes , weszling said , would deal more with the factual aspects of the faith rather than the practice and belief .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier stressed earlier this year at a press conference , the islamic education model at a school in erlangen was based on close cooperation with muslims living permanently in bavaria and receptive to integration .
she said it gave priority to " values laid down in the constitution such as human dignity , freedom , equality and tolerance . "
the minister added the aim was to " allow muslim students a suitable offer in their schools to learn more about their own faith . "
lessons in german can ensure transparency islamic instruction in german may be a new feature , but private lessons have existed in germany since the first turkish immigrants began arriving in the 1960s and are now offered by teachers across the country in arabic and bosnian as well .

schools in three states are offering muslim students a chance to learn about their faith in the german language instead of in their mother tongue , in a move that ’ s hoped to contribute towards better integration . as schools in germany get ready to welcome back students after six long weeks of summer vacation , a few in berlin , lower saxony and bavaria feature a new subject on their curriculum - islamic education .
the idea isn ’ t exactly new .
in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .
but germany ’ s complex federal system of education , whereby education remains a prerogative of the länder or states , has meant that the proposal couldn ’ t be applied across the board .
the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .
" contributing towards integration and tolerance " the number of states offering islamic education in german has been growing gradually .
the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to 800,000 muslims , has sponsored optional islamic religion instruction classes as a sort of test run in 24 schools since 1999 . last year , in a rare move , berlin , lower saxony and bavaria committed themselves to introducing concrete islamic education in the german language in close cooperation with islamic organizations in the country .
while berlin got off to a head start with the subject already offered in around 20 schools and now being extended to 30 this week , lower saxony and bavaria are treading new ground with it .
mr. weszling , a spokesman at the education ministry in lower saxony , home to about 40,000 muslim students , told deutsche welle the model was initially being tested on eight primary schools in the state and had been hammered out together with islamic organizations .
" the parents will decide whether they want to send their children to the class , " he said , but added " we ’ re hoping it will contribute towards integration , tolerance and more understanding of the religion . "
the classes , weszling said , would deal more with the factual aspects of the faith rather than the practice and belief .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier stressed earlier this year at a press conference , the islamic education model at a school in erlangen was based on close cooperation with muslims living permanently in bavaria and receptive to integration .
she said it gave priority to " values laid down in the constitution such as human dignity , freedom , equality and tolerance . "
the minister added the aim was to " allow muslim students a suitable offer in their schools to learn more about their own faith . "
lessons in german can ensure transparency islamic instruction in german may be a new feature , but private lessons have existed in germany since the first turkish immigrants began arriving in the 1960s and are now offered by teachers across the country in arabic and bosnian as well .
however the discovery of the hamburg terror cell and germany ’ s subsequent clampdown on islamist and extremist organizations in the country , have heightened concerns about extremist views trickling into lessons conducted by islamic organizations in koran schools and back rooms of mosques .
officials stress that drawing the state into the issue will ensure it a greater degree of transparency .

the united states has formally asked the world trade organization to declare the eu ’ s refusal to import most genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- as illegal . backed by canada and argentina , the united states on monday pushed ahead with filing a formal complaint with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , requesting it to set up an arbitration panel to investigate the united states ' ongoing trade row with the european union .
the move marks the latest round in the lengthy transatlantic dispute sparked by the eu ’ s ban on the import of gm foods and grains and a mandatory labeling program introduced last month on gm food and animal feed .
it also raises the prospect of a fresh trade war ahead of crucial world trade talks in mexico .
though wto rules allow the eu , as the defendant , temporarily to block the move , the panel will automatically be formed when washington repeats its request at the next wto meeting on august 29 .
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy defended the eu ’ s stance .
" we regret this move to an unnecessary litigation , " he said in a statement .
" the eu ’ s regulatory system for gmos is clear , transparent , reasonable and non-discriminatory . "
lamy added he was confident the wto would overturn the u.s. complaint .
eu environment minister margot wallstrom warned the u.s. move could backfire .
" there should be no doubt that it is not our intention to create trade barriers .
but my concern is that this request will muddy the waters of the debate in europe .
we have to create confidence among citizens for gmos and then allow them to choose . "
u.s. hit by eu ban on gm imports the u.s. , the world leader in biotech crops , say its gm exports to the eu have been unfairly hit by a moratorium imposed by the bloc on farming and the import of gm food and grain in 1998 , with u.s. corn farmers complaining they lose about € 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
at the heart of the debate lie the eu ’ s safety concerns over gm technology , which prompted the moratorium in the first place .
officials and environmentalists in the 15-member bloc have repeatedly voiced concerns about the health risks and the risk to the environment posed by gm crops .
critics in the eu have also stressed that not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
washington however argues there is no scientific evidence pointing to human health or environmental problems related to biotech products and has urged the europeans to lift the ban .
in june , the war of words intensified when u.s. president george bush accused the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight because europe refused to accept gm crops , which often grow faster and are more disease-resistant than normal crops .
eu labeling program angers u.s. last month , in what was seen as a first step towards lifting the moratorium and easing trade relations with the united states , eu farm ministers approved new labeling regulations for biotech food that would eventually open up the european market to gm food .
the regulation , expected to come into force next spring , would apply to foodstuffs at every stage of production and would include all products that contain more than 0.9 percent of gmos .
producers would have six months to label their products accordingly .
the measure has been touted by the eu as restoring consumer confidence about the safety of gm products and on monday it also cited a survey conducted by u.s. television station abc in july which said 92 percent of the american public was in favor of biotech crop labeling .
it has however failed to win over the u.s. government , which complains its products would also have to be mandatorily tagged .
american farming organizations say being forced to use " gmo warning labels " on their products amounts to unfair trade barriers and involves high costs .
the latest spat over transatlantic biotech trade coincides with another potential trade dispute brewing between the europe and the united states , this time over the eu ’ s push for global brand protection of famous food such as gorgonzola and drinks like cognac .

the united states has formally asked the world trade organization to declare the eu ’ s refusal to import most genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- as illegal . backed by canada and argentina , the united states on monday pushed ahead with filing a formal complaint with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , requesting it to set up an arbitration panel to investigate the united states ' ongoing trade row with the european union .
the move marks the latest round in the lengthy transatlantic dispute sparked by the eu ’ s ban on the import of gm foods and grains and a mandatory labeling program introduced last month on gm food and animal feed .
it also raises the prospect of a fresh trade war ahead of crucial world trade talks in mexico .
though wto rules allow the eu , as the defendant , temporarily to block the move , the panel will automatically be formed when washington repeats its request at the next wto meeting on august 29 .
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy defended the eu ’ s stance .
" we regret this move to an unnecessary litigation , " he said in a statement .
" the eu ’ s regulatory system for gmos is clear , transparent , reasonable and non-discriminatory . "
lamy added he was confident the wto would overturn the u.s. complaint .
eu environment minister margot wallstrom warned the u.s. move could backfire .
" there should be no doubt that it is not our intention to create trade barriers .
but my concern is that this request will muddy the waters of the debate in europe .
we have to create confidence among citizens for gmos and then allow them to choose . "
u.s. hit by eu ban on gm imports the u.s. , the world leader in biotech crops , say its gm exports to the eu have been unfairly hit by a moratorium imposed by the bloc on farming and the import of gm food and grain in 1998 , with u.s. corn farmers complaining they lose about € 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
at the heart of the debate lie the eu ’ s safety concerns over gm technology , which prompted the moratorium in the first place .
officials and environmentalists in the 15-member bloc have repeatedly voiced concerns about the health risks and the risk to the environment posed by gm crops .
critics in the eu have also stressed that not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
washington however argues there is no scientific evidence pointing to human health or environmental problems related to biotech products and has urged the europeans to lift the ban .
in june , the war of words intensified when u.s. president george bush accused the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight because europe refused to accept gm crops , which often grow faster and are more disease-resistant than normal crops .
eu labeling program angers u.s. last month , in what was seen as a first step towards lifting the moratorium and easing trade relations with the united states , eu farm ministers approved new labeling regulations for biotech food that would eventually open up the european market to gm food .
the regulation , expected to come into force next spring , would apply to foodstuffs at every stage of production and would include all products that contain more than 0.9 percent of gmos .
producers would have six months to label their products accordingly .
the measure has been touted by the eu as restoring consumer confidence about the safety of gm products and on monday it also cited a survey conducted by u.s. television station abc in july which said 92 percent of the american public was in favor of biotech crop labeling .
it has however failed to win over the u.s. government , which complains its products would also have to be mandatorily tagged .
american farming organizations say being forced to use " gmo warning labels " on their products amounts to unfair trade barriers and involves high costs .
the latest spat over transatlantic biotech trade coincides with another potential trade dispute brewing between the europe and the united states , this time over the eu ’ s push for global brand protection of famous food such as gorgonzola and drinks like cognac .
though eu member states failed on monday to come up with a final list of its most well-known culinary treats , the united states has been upset with what it sees as europe ’ s insistence on using geographical labels as a means to restrict market access . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

now , to prove their case , they have announced they will take dna tests . the car , an old , rusty vw beetle , stands close to the museum .
a small information board next to it explains how the car 's owner , charles lindbergh , used it to travel the world .
africa , europe , the middle east - lindbergh was , apart from a world-famous pilot , an enthusiastic driver .
two weeks ago , three germans announced they , too , had spent time in that very same car with charles lindbergh - who they now claim is their father . the news came both as a surprise , both to the lindbergh museum in little falls , minnesota and lindbergh 's legitimate family in the united states .
there , lindbergh was married to writer anne morrow , with whom he had six children .
the three germans , astrid bouteil , dyrk and david hesshaimer who say lindbergh is their father , claim the pilot also had a clandestine relationship with their mother , brigitte hessheimer from munich , who he visited regularly under the pseudonym careu kent .
they have now announced they want to take genetic tests to prove it . love letters in the attic it all began back in the 1980s when the middle child , astrid bouteil , began investigating the life of the mysterious man she knew as her father , a man who would stay with the hessheimers regularly but never for more than two weeks .
in the family attic , bouteil , who now lives in paris , the city in which lindbergh landed after traversing the atlantic on his legendary solo flight , found 112 letters allegedly written by lindbergh to her mother , brigitte hessheimer .
on confronting her mother with the letters , hessheimer was said to have burst into tears .
the children promised to keep the secret until both their mother and lindbergh 's wife had deceased . bouteil and her two brothers support their case with pictures of lindbergh and his second family in munich and their own faces which bear a remarkable likeness to the pilot .
all three insist they have no interest in lindbergh 's estate or legacy but that they only wish to set the record straight .
" to discover your own identity is a fundamental desire of every person . "
astrid bouteil told the süddeutsche zeitung , which first reported on the case earlier this month .
" deep down everyone wants to know who their father is . " the three germans say they spent little time with their father , but that the moments they had with him were particularly intensive .
all three can remember details such as how lindbergh wriggled his ears or his shoes , which were so big , that the children put puppets in them at night . " hauntingly familiar " however , the germans allegations have also been met with skepticism , in particular in the united states .
here , at least a dozen men have claimed in the past to be lindbergh 's first son , believed to have been murdered as a baby back in 1932 .
marlene white , executive director of the lindbergh foundation , whose president is lindbergh 's daughter reeve , told stern magazine the family refused to comment .
" it is not the first time that people claim charles lindbergh is their father " . but an american grandson of lindbergh has said he thought it could be possible that the germans were telling the truth as they looked so " hauntingly familiar . "
he has now declared he will take up the germans ' offer to go through with dna tests , and will submit to one himself . " i 'm not speaking for the lindbergh family but only for myself - i believe it is possible -lrb- they are the lindbergh children -rrb- , " morgan lindbergh , whose father jon , was the second child of charles and anne morrow lindbergh , told reuters in a telephone interview . a. scott berg , author of a prize-winning biography of lindbergh , said the story was possible but unlikely .
" i 'm happy to believe that their mother told them charles lindbergh was their father , " berg said in an interview with stern magazine .
" i do n't know anything about this woman 's state .
it certainly was n't easy to raise three children in the 1950s without a father . " ties to goering lindbergh came to fame as the first person to fly alone across the atlantic , from new york to paris , in 1927 .
during the 33-hour-long flight , people across the world followed his trip on the radio , while the united states played the french national anthem on his arrival in paris . his widespread popularity was overshadowed by lindbergh 's pre-war sympathy for nazi germany and ties with luftwaffe leader hermann goering , but he later changed his views and was largely rehabilitated . linbergh met brigitte hessheimer , a munich hat maker , in 1957 .
lindbergh allegedly spent up to two weeks three times a year in munich until 1974 .
weakened by cancer , lindbergh 's last visit was in 1973 , one year before his death .
" i 'm losing strength every day " , he wrote in his last letter to hessheimer .

the german press on tuesday focused on allegations that the german government had paid ransom to secure the release of hostage in the sahara .
other papers concentrated on the ongoing pension reforms . the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- criticized this comment by the green party parliamentary speaker ludger volmer for saying , “ germany does not pay ransoms - and if it did , it wouldn ’ t admit it . ” the paper called his comments “ extraordinarily clumsy ” and said they indicated to potential kidnappers " that blackmailing the german government out of a few million euros is child ’ s play . ”
the ftd continued : “ the hostage takers have got what they wanted .
it ’ s no solution to let the local government buy them off and then transfer the money under the guise of development aid . ”
it went on to say volmer ’ s remark highlighted the government ’ s dilemma .
“ a state can not give in to the demands of bandits and terror groups , but at the same time it is responsible for every one of its citizens , and this responsibility doesn ’ t end at the german border . ”
the braunschweiger zeitung warned the end of the sahara hostages ’ ordeal didn ’ t mean germany had been given the all-clear ; rather quite the opposite .
it saw the likelihood that the german government has paid a ransom of possibly millions of euro , as an encouragement to terrorists all over the world to lie in wait for new victims .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung agreed .
“ the government shouldn ’ t let itself be blackmailed , certainly not by terrorists or greedy criminals , ” it wrote .
it also commented that questions would now be asked about the degree of responsibility on the part of the hostages themselves .
“ they travelled to a country not renowned for its safety , knowing that someone would come to their aid if the worst came to the worst , ” the paper wrote .
“ one could hold that against them , ” it said , “ but it would be better to do this behind closed doors . ”
several german papers however didn ’ t heed the faz ’ s warning to be discreet .
the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung asked why daredevil “ extreme ” tourists continued to ignore warnings about regional conflict zones crime and violent separatists .
“ the southern sahara has long been considered dangerous territory , ” the daily wrote , “ but for people looking for adventure , this is a kind of encouragement : it ’ s the warnings that make the area interesting . ”

whereas previously the shootings and explosions carried out by unknown guerillas in the streets of the war-torn country have concentrated on the occupying forces , this latest targeting of the u.n. spreads the fallout over the international arena .
envoy included in mounting dead the attack , which took place at about 16:40 local time , brought down three floors of the concrete building , injuring many of those who were at work there and killing 17 , including the u.n. 's special representative to baghdad , sergio vieira de mello .
vieira de mello was trapped in the wreckage of the building long after the bomb struck ; his body was recovered by u.s. soldiers who rushed to the scene .
the u.n. building , a former hotel , had recently seen an increase in security before what u.s. officials at the scene believed to be a possible suicide attack by a person or persons in a large vehicle loaded with explosives .
eyewitnesses to the destruction said the main force of the explosion centered on the point of the building directly under vieira de mello 's office window .
a u.n. spokesman in baghdad , salim lone , made a statement soon after , calling the explosion " an unspeakable crime against people from all over the world who have come here to help the people of iraq . "
in new york , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan 's spokesman fred eckhard described the attack as " a tragedy , i think , not only personally but also a setback politically for the u.n. mission . "
loss felt throughout u.n.
" the loss of sergio vieira de mello is a bitter blow to the united nations and to me personally , " kofi annan said in a press conference .
" the death of any colleague is hard to bear , but i can think of no one we could less afford to spare than sergio . "
the united nations security council issued a statement saying : " this horrible attack , aimed at undermining the vital role of the u.n. in iraq , will not affect our determination .
we will stay united against such attacks and to help the iraqi people restore peace and stability to their country . "
enemies of the people president george w. bush told assembled members of the media at the white house , " the terrorists have again shown their contempt for the innocent , shown their fear of progress and hatred for peace .
they are the enemies of the people of iraq , the enemies of every nation that seeks to help the iraqi people . "
he added , " by their tactics and targets these murderers reveal themselves once more as enemies of the civilized world . "
the ramifications will not only stretch as far as the united nations and the organization 's efforts to aid the rebuilding of iraq and the return to normal life after years of sanctions and war but to the whole of the international community .
an act against the united nations could well be seen as a serious escalation of violence that could drag many world powers , including the european union , into a concerted diplomatic effort and , possibly , unwanted and messy military involvement .
the bombing is only the latest attack on non-military targets in iraq .
oil , water and electricity lines were attacked by what coalition spokesman called saboteurs over the weekend , while earlier this month , a car bomb exploded outside the jordanian embassy in baghdad , leaving 10 people dead . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

we will stay united against such attacks and to help the iraqi people restore peace and stability to their country . "
enemies of the people president george w. bush told assembled members of the media at the white house , " the terrorists have again shown their contempt for the innocent , shown their fear of progress and hatred for peace .

an act against the united nations could well be seen as a serious escalation of violence that could drag many world powers , including the european union , into a concerted diplomatic effort and , possibly , unwanted and messy military involvement .

whereas previously the shootings and explosions carried out by unknown guerillas in the streets of the war-torn country have concentrated on the occupying forces , this latest targeting of the u.n. spreads the fallout over the international arena .
envoy included in mounting dead the attack , which took place at about 16:40 local time , brought down three floors of the concrete building , injuring many of those who were at work there and killing 17 , including the u.n. 's special representative to baghdad , sergio vieira de mello .
vieira de mello was trapped in the wreckage of the building long after the bomb struck ; his body was recovered by u.s. soldiers who rushed to the scene .
the u.n. building , a former hotel , had recently seen an increase in security before what u.s. officials at the scene believed to be a possible suicide attack by a person or persons in a large vehicle loaded with explosives .
eyewitnesses to the destruction said the main force of the explosion centered on the point of the building directly under vieira de mello 's office window .
a u.n. spokesman in baghdad , salim lone , made a statement soon after , calling the explosion " an unspeakable crime against people from all over the world who have come here to help the people of iraq . "
in new york , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan 's spokesman fred eckhard described the attack as " a tragedy , i think , not only personally but also a setback politically for the u.n. mission . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.08.2003 learning about mohammed and the koran in german großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : listening to islamic religious instruction in german .
schools in three states are offering muslim students a chance to learn about their faith in the german language instead of in their mother tongue , in a move that ’ s hoped to contribute towards better integration . as schools in germany get ready to welcome back students after six long weeks of summer vacation , a few in berlin , lower saxony and bavaria feature a new subject on their curriculum - islamic education .
the idea isn ’ t exactly new .
in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .
but germany ’ s complex federal system of education , whereby education remains a prerogative of the länder or states , has meant that the proposal couldn ’ t be applied across the board .
the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .
" contributing towards integration and tolerance " the number of states offering islamic education in german has been growing gradually .
the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to 800,000 muslims , has sponsored optional islamic religion instruction classes as a sort of test run in 24 schools since 1999 . last year , in a rare move , berlin , lower saxony and bavaria committed themselves to introducing concrete islamic education in the german language in close cooperation with islamic organizations in the country .
while berlin got off to a head start with the subject already offered in around 20 schools and now being extended to 30 this week , lower saxony and bavaria are treading new ground with it .
mr. weszling , a spokesman at the education ministry in lower saxony , home to about 40,000 muslim students , told deutsche welle the model was initially being tested on eight primary schools in the state and had been hammered out together with islamic organizations .
" the parents will decide whether they want to send their children to the class , " he said , but added " we ’ re hoping it will contribute towards integration , tolerance and more understanding of the religion . "
the classes , weszling said , would deal more with the factual aspects of the faith rather than the practice and belief .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier stressed earlier this year at a press conference , the islamic education model at a school in erlangen was based on close cooperation with muslims living permanently in bavaria and receptive to integration .
she said it gave priority to " values laid down in the constitution such as human dignity , freedom , equality and tolerance . "

schools in three states are offering muslim students a chance to learn about their faith in the german language instead of in their mother tongue , in a move that ’ s hoped to contribute towards better integration . as schools in germany get ready to welcome back students after six long weeks of summer vacation , a few in berlin , lower saxony and bavaria feature a new subject on their curriculum - islamic education .
the idea isn ’ t exactly new .
in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .
but germany ’ s complex federal system of education , whereby education remains a prerogative of the länder or states , has meant that the proposal couldn ’ t be applied across the board .
the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .
" contributing towards integration and tolerance " the number of states offering islamic education in german has been growing gradually .
the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to 800,000 muslims , has sponsored optional islamic religion instruction classes as a sort of test run in 24 schools since 1999 . last year , in a rare move , berlin , lower saxony and bavaria committed themselves to introducing concrete islamic education in the german language in close cooperation with islamic organizations in the country .
while berlin got off to a head start with the subject already offered in around 20 schools and now being extended to 30 this week , lower saxony and bavaria are treading new ground with it .
mr. weszling , a spokesman at the education ministry in lower saxony , home to about 40,000 muslim students , told deutsche welle the model was initially being tested on eight primary schools in the state and had been hammered out together with islamic organizations .
" the parents will decide whether they want to send their children to the class , " he said , but added " we ’ re hoping it will contribute towards integration , tolerance and more understanding of the religion . "
the classes , weszling said , would deal more with the factual aspects of the faith rather than the practice and belief .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier stressed earlier this year at a press conference , the islamic education model at a school in erlangen was based on close cooperation with muslims living permanently in bavaria and receptive to integration .
she said it gave priority to " values laid down in the constitution such as human dignity , freedom , equality and tolerance . "
the minister added the aim was to " allow muslim students a suitable offer in their schools to learn more about their own faith . "

mayor ole von beust fired ronald schill after the former judge allegedly threatened to out him . hamburg mayor ole von beust fired the city-state 's controversial interior minister on tuesday .
he said that ' law and order ' man ronald schill had threatened to publicly out beust as a homosexual .
" i have dismissed mr. schill , " beust told reporters .
" i felt forced to dismiss him because schill 's character is not suited to the office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust .
the two men had met to discuss schill 's deputy walter wellinghausen , who beust -lrb- picture -rrb- also dismissed .
wellinghausen , who had been schill 's attorney , has been accused of illegally continuing to collect pay in another capacity after he became privy counselor .
according to beust , schill said the mayor had made his ostensible partner his justice minister and that the two had a homosexual relationship .
" the end of a nightmare " relief was apparent after schill 's sacking was announced .
" for the police , it 's the end of a nightmare , " the head of the police trade union , konrad freiberg , said .
" the dgb emphatically welcomes the fact that ole von beust dismissed interior minister schill and his privy counsel wellinghausen , " german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- regional head erhard pumm announced .
even representatives from schill 's coalition partner , the free democratic party , expressed relief , " we have absolutely no sympathy for mr. schill 's behavior .
we consider mayor von beust 's actions appropriate . "
although ronald barnabas schill disputed beust 's accusations , he said he now wished to retire from politics .
hamburg 's haider the dismissal may mark the end of a short but dramatic career in politics for the hamburg judge .
" judge merciless , " as the german media dubbed him , first drew nationwide attention for the draconic sentences he handed down in the hamburg court he presided over .
the " law-and-order " man formed his own political party , the schill party in july 2000 and campaigned in the september 2001 hamburg elections .
at the same time as fending off comparisons to austria 's rightwing politician jörg haider , schill called for sex offenders to be castrated , suspected drug dealers to be fed emetics to retrieve evidence and convicted foreigners to be deported .
throughout the campaign he was haunted by the three-day jail sentence he had imposed on the two young men in 1999 for disturbing court proceedings .
a hamburg court had already convicted schill of false imprisonment and perversion of justice based on accusations that he delayed a complaint made by the men .
but schill 's hardline appealed to the hamburg electorate .
his party earned 19.4 percent of the votes in the traditionally social democratic city , 25 of the 121 mandates .
suddenly the schill party had the chance to make-up part of the city 's ruling coalition , which after more than three weeks of talks it did , along with the christian democrats and the free democrats .
schill was named interior minister and deputy mayor , while two other party members headed up hamburg ministries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schill gave hamburg cops a makeover .
schill 's first 100 days in office , starting on october 31 , 2001 , were overshadowed by accusations that the senator used cocaine and the furore surrounding the expensive uniforms he ordered to make hamburg 's police look " nicer . "
he submitted hair for a drug test that cleared him of the drug-taking charges .
schill was acquitted of false imprisonment and perversion of justice in december 2001 .
schill , the court said " objectively " perverted justice , but not on purpose , and he had lied .
hours later schill named his defense attorney , walter wellinghausen , privy counselor in the interior ministry .
uproar in parliament the national spotlight turned to schill again in late august 2002 when he addressed the german parliament during a discussion of aid for flooded german regions .
schill used the opportunity to accuse the german governments of the past years of " total failure . "
twice schill 's microphone was turned off after he refused to bring his rant to an end .
across the political spectrum german politicians and the media were scandalized by schill 's behavior .
" this is the last time that such a thing will happen , " hamburg mayor beust announced in response .
beust has been as good as his word , despite the risk that it could have meant the end for his three-way coalition .
so far though , the ruling coalition is standing firm .
after a meeting on tuesday the three parties announced that their cooperation would continue uninterrupted .
schill party chairman mario mettbach said the disgraced interior minister 's predecessor will be named by friday .
the hamburg district attorney is investigating whether to take legal action against schill for coercion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

mayor ole von beust fired ronald schill after the former judge allegedly threatened to out him . hamburg mayor ole von beust fired the city-state 's controversial interior minister on tuesday .
he said that ' law and order ' man ronald schill had threatened to publicly out beust as a homosexual .
" i have dismissed mr. schill , " beust told reporters .
" i felt forced to dismiss him because schill 's character is not suited to the office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust .
the two men had met to discuss schill 's deputy walter wellinghausen , who beust -lrb- picture -rrb- also dismissed .
wellinghausen , who had been schill 's attorney , has been accused of illegally continuing to collect pay in another capacity after he became privy counselor .
according to beust , schill said the mayor had made his ostensible partner his justice minister and that the two had a homosexual relationship .
" the end of a nightmare " relief was apparent after schill 's sacking was announced .
" for the police , it 's the end of a nightmare , " the head of the police trade union , konrad freiberg , said .
" the dgb emphatically welcomes the fact that ole von beust dismissed interior minister schill and his privy counsel wellinghausen , " german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- regional head erhard pumm announced .
even representatives from schill 's coalition partner , the free democratic party , expressed relief , " we have absolutely no sympathy for mr. schill 's behavior .
we consider mayor von beust 's actions appropriate . "
although ronald barnabas schill disputed beust 's accusations , he said he now wished to retire from politics .
hamburg 's haider the dismissal may mark the end of a short but dramatic career in politics for the hamburg judge .
" judge merciless , " as the german media dubbed him , first drew nationwide attention for the draconic sentences he handed down in the hamburg court he presided over .
the " law-and-order " man formed his own political party , the schill party in july 2000 and campaigned in the september 2001 hamburg elections .
at the same time as fending off comparisons to austria 's rightwing politician jörg haider , schill called for sex offenders to be castrated , suspected drug dealers to be fed emetics to retrieve evidence and convicted foreigners to be deported .
throughout the campaign he was haunted by the three-day jail sentence he had imposed on the two young men in 1999 for disturbing court proceedings .
a hamburg court had already convicted schill of false imprisonment and perversion of justice based on accusations that he delayed a complaint made by the men .
but schill 's hardline appealed to the hamburg electorate .
his party earned 19.4 percent of the votes in the traditionally social democratic city , 25 of the 121 mandates .
suddenly the schill party had the chance to make-up part of the city 's ruling coalition , which after more than three weeks of talks it did , along with the christian democrats and the free democrats .
schill was named interior minister and deputy mayor , while two other party members headed up hamburg ministries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schill gave hamburg cops a makeover .
schill 's first 100 days in office , starting on october 31 , 2001 , were overshadowed by accusations that the senator used cocaine and the furore surrounding the expensive uniforms he ordered to make hamburg 's police look " nicer . "
he submitted hair for a drug test that cleared him of the drug-taking charges .
schill was acquitted of false imprisonment and perversion of justice in december 2001 .
schill , the court said " objectively " perverted justice , but not on purpose , and he had lied .
hours later schill named his defense attorney , walter wellinghausen , privy counselor in the interior ministry .
uproar in parliament the national spotlight turned to schill again in late august 2002 when he addressed the german parliament during a discussion of aid for flooded german regions .
schill used the opportunity to accuse the german governments of the past years of " total failure . "
twice schill 's microphone was turned off after he refused to bring his rant to an end .
across the political spectrum german politicians and the media were scandalized by schill 's behavior .
" this is the last time that such a thing will happen , " hamburg mayor beust announced in response .
beust has been as good as his word , despite the risk that it could have meant the end for his three-way coalition .
so far though , the ruling coalition is standing firm .
after a meeting on tuesday the three parties announced that their cooperation would continue uninterrupted .
schill party chairman mario mettbach said the disgraced interior minister 's predecessor will be named by friday .

fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .
the group is expected to leave for germany on tuesday . german and malian authorities have confirmed that the fourteen european tourists , kidnapped by an islamic outfit in north africa for almost six months , are free and safe .
the german foreign ministry said late monday evening the group , which include nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were freed by their kidnappers near the city of tessalit in northern mali .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , a key official in the negotiating process , praised the malian authorities for their cooperation .
" this was great negotiating skill by the mali president -lrb- amadou toumani toure -rrb- , " chrobog told a german television station from the malian capital of bamako .
" the president confirmed to me that all the hostages are well .
so that is also a relief , it seems that no one has been hurt , " chrobog added .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said chrobog had told him the freed hostages were in the care of german authorities in mali on tuesday evening .
schröder commended the cooperation with the algerian and malian authorities and offered the countries help in apprehending the kidnappers and in combating terrorism .
the hostages are believed to be heading towards the east malian town of gao in an auto convoy , from where they are expected to be airlifted by an airplane belonging to the german armed forces equipped with doctors and paramedics .
one of the hostages has reportedly spoken to chrobog on the telephone and assured him that the group was in good health .
the group will be brought to bamako and flown to the cologne airport after a meeting with the malian president .

the 14 were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while travelling in southern algeria .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages , by killing their kidnappers belonging to the islamist outfit , salafist group for preaching and combat .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 .
after the shootout , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month .
german and malian negotiators have been in contact with the kidnappers , who according to german media reports , want $ 5 million for each hostage , though it hasn ’ t been confirmed by the authorities .
however it remains unclear whether any ransom was paid .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday that the efforts to secure the release of the hostages had been " extremely difficult and delicate " right from the beginning .
he however underlined the german government ’ s position to refuse to pay any ransom .
malian officials said last week that kidnappers had demanded a ransom , but that the impoverished country could not pay it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first hostages home await the return of their companions .
dutch foreign minister jaap de hoop scheffer said in an interview with a dutch television station on monday he couldn ’ t confirm whether any ransom had been paid .
" you know that dutch policy is , and will always be , not to pay ransoms when dutch nationals are abducted . "
the minister added , " there was close cooperation with germany , whose nationals made up most of the hostages , and with the netherlands and switzerland .
germany obviously played first fiddle . "
on monday there were conflicting reports about the release of the hostages .
the handing over of the hostages to malian negotiators was delayed apparently after storms and rain hampered the transport of the hostages to the designated location for the hand over .
" hostages should pay for release " in germany meanwhile a debate has already broken out on the apparent foolhardiness of the tourists traveling to a dangerous region without adequate preparations .
parliamentary leader of the conservative opposition of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach has demanded that kidnapped tourists should in certain cases shoulder a share of the costs involved in securing their release .

military and humanitarian aid should be separate , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces to protect civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .

in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .
but germany ’ s complex federal system of education , whereby education remains a prerogative of the länder or states , has meant that the proposal couldn ’ t be applied across the board .
the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .
" contributing towards integration and tolerance " the number of states offering islamic education in german has been growing gradually .
the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to 800,000 muslims , has sponsored optional islamic religion instruction classes as a sort of test run in 24 schools since 1999 . last year , in a rare move , berlin , lower saxony and bavaria committed themselves to introducing concrete islamic education in the german language in close cooperation with islamic organizations in the country .
while berlin got off to a head start with the subject already offered in around 20 schools and now being extended to 30 this week , lower saxony and bavaria are treading new ground with it .
mr. weszling , a spokesman at the education ministry in lower saxony , home to about 40,000 muslim students , told deutsche welle the model was initially being tested on eight primary schools in the state and had been hammered out together with islamic organizations .
" the parents will decide whether they want to send their children to the class , " he said , but added " we ’ re hoping it will contribute towards integration , tolerance and more understanding of the religion . "
the classes , weszling said , would deal more with the factual aspects of the faith rather than the practice and belief .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier stressed earlier this year at a press conference , the islamic education model at a school in erlangen was based on close cooperation with muslims living permanently in bavaria and receptive to integration .
she said it gave priority to " values laid down in the constitution such as human dignity , freedom , equality and tolerance . "
the minister added the aim was to " allow muslim students a suitable offer in their schools to learn more about their own faith . "
lessons in german can ensure transparency islamic instruction in german may be a new feature , but private lessons have existed in germany since the first turkish immigrants began arriving in the 1960s and are now offered by teachers across the country in arabic and bosnian as well .
however the discovery of the hamburg terror cell and germany ’ s subsequent clampdown on islamist and extremist organizations in the country , have heightened concerns about extremist views trickling into lessons conducted by islamic organizations in koran schools and back rooms of mosques .
officials stress that drawing the state into the issue will ensure it a greater degree of transparency .
" when islamic classes are held in german and under the state-school board , we know what gets taught , " social democrat ute vogt , head of the domestic policy committee in germany ’ s parliament said last year during the height of the debate . " it ’ s important for the state to have control so that there ’ s no possibility islamic education could turn into an anti-democratic movement , " hans-gert lange , spokesman for the federal office for the protection of the constitution told deutsche welle .
no legitimate muslim representative but it ’ s not just security concerns that have delayed efforts so far in getting islamic education well off the ground .
most states interested in offering the subject in german complain there ’ s no legitimate representative on the muslim side such as is the case with the church , who they can deal with in shaping religious lessons .
" it ’ s a very fundamental problem , " thomas john of berlin ’ s education ministry said .
" there are so many sunni , shiite and alewites groups .
it ’ s difficult to find a unified voice .
we can only hope the muslims can come to an agreement about that . "
unlike in france , where a recently-formed national council for muslims represents the country ’ s five-million community and deals directly with the french state on all issues , germany has a bunch of splintered islamic organizations , all with their own agenda and often in competition with each other .
but ali kizilkaya the chairman of the council of muslims , one of the largest organizations , said there were enough muslim representatives the german state could talk to if it was interested .
" we have the impression that all models are headed towards not allowing muslims to participate , " he told news agency afp . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows what germans think about islam a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling .

fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .
the group is expected to leave for germany on tuesday . german and malian authorities have confirmed that the fourteen european tourists , kidnapped by an islamic outfit in north africa for almost six months , are free and safe .
the german foreign ministry said late monday evening the group , which include nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were freed by their kidnappers near the city of tessalit in northern mali .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , a key official in the negotiating process , praised the malian authorities for their cooperation .
" this was great negotiating skill by the mali president -lrb- amadou toumani toure -rrb- , " chrobog told a german television station from the malian capital of bamako .
" the president confirmed to me that all the hostages are well .
so that is also a relief , it seems that no one has been hurt , " chrobog added .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said chrobog had told him the freed hostages were in the care of german authorities in mali on tuesday evening .
schröder commended the cooperation with the algerian and malian authorities and offered the countries help in apprehending the kidnappers and in combating terrorism .
the hostages are believed to be heading towards the east malian town of gao in an auto convoy , from where they are expected to be airlifted by an airplane belonging to the german armed forces equipped with doctors and paramedics .
one of the hostages has reportedly spoken to chrobog on the telephone and assured him that the group was in good health .
the group will be brought to bamako and flown to the cologne airport after a meeting with the malian president .
no news on ransom payment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hostages will soon be on their way home .
the 14 were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while travelling in southern algeria .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages , by killing their kidnappers belonging to the islamist outfit , salafist group for preaching and combat .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 .
after the shootout , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month .
german and malian negotiators have been in contact with the kidnappers , who according to german media reports , want $ 5 million for each hostage , though it hasn ’ t been confirmed by the authorities .
however it remains unclear whether any ransom was paid .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday that the efforts to secure the release of the hostages had been " extremely difficult and delicate " right from the beginning .
he however underlined the german government ’ s position to refuse to pay any ransom .
malian officials said last week that kidnappers had demanded a ransom , but that the impoverished country could not pay it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first hostages home await the return of their companions .
dutch foreign minister jaap de hoop scheffer said in an interview with a dutch television station on monday he couldn ’ t confirm whether any ransom had been paid .
" you know that dutch policy is , and will always be , not to pay ransoms when dutch nationals are abducted . "
the minister added , " there was close cooperation with germany , whose nationals made up most of the hostages , and with the netherlands and switzerland .
germany obviously played first fiddle . "
on monday there were conflicting reports about the release of the hostages .
the handing over of the hostages to malian negotiators was delayed apparently after storms and rain hampered the transport of the hostages to the designated location for the hand over .
" hostages should pay for release " in germany meanwhile a debate has already broken out on the apparent foolhardiness of the tourists traveling to a dangerous region without adequate preparations .
parliamentary leader of the conservative opposition of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach has demanded that kidnapped tourists should in certain cases shoulder a share of the costs involved in securing their release .
" those who get themselves in danger through their own frivolity and for the thrill of it , should reckon on with paying for their release , " bosbach told the financial times deutschland .
the minister also criticized that tourists often ignored travel warnings issued by the foreign ministry . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.08.2003 aid organizations criticize germany ’ s afghanistan plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuilding afghanistan is a humanitarian goal , not a military one .
military and humanitarian aid should be separate , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces to protect civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .
first the military enters , then the aid organizations follow up with their humanitarian assistance ; the two tasks can not be combined . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 07 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the united states has formally asked the world trade organization to declare the eu ’ s refusal to import most genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- as illegal . backed by canada and argentina , the united states on monday pushed ahead with filing a formal complaint with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , requesting it to set up an arbitration panel to investigate the united states ' ongoing trade row with the european union .
the move marks the latest round in the lengthy transatlantic dispute sparked by the eu ’ s ban on the import of gm foods and grains and a mandatory labeling program introduced last month on gm food and animal feed .
it also raises the prospect of a fresh trade war ahead of crucial world trade talks in mexico .
though wto rules allow the eu , as the defendant , temporarily to block the move , the panel will automatically be formed when washington repeats its request at the next wto meeting on august 29 .
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy defended the eu ’ s stance .
" we regret this move to an unnecessary litigation , " he said in a statement .
" the eu ’ s regulatory system for gmos is clear , transparent , reasonable and non-discriminatory . "
lamy added he was confident the wto would overturn the u.s. complaint .
eu environment minister margot wallstrom warned the u.s. move could backfire .
" there should be no doubt that it is not our intention to create trade barriers .
but my concern is that this request will muddy the waters of the debate in europe .
we have to create confidence among citizens for gmos and then allow them to choose . "
u.s. hit by eu ban on gm imports the u.s. , the world leader in biotech crops , say its gm exports to the eu have been unfairly hit by a moratorium imposed by the bloc on farming and the import of gm food and grain in 1998 , with u.s. corn farmers complaining they lose about € 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
at the heart of the debate lie the eu ’ s safety concerns over gm technology , which prompted the moratorium in the first place .
officials and environmentalists in the 15-member bloc have repeatedly voiced concerns about the health risks and the risk to the environment posed by gm crops .
critics in the eu have also stressed that not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
washington however argues there is no scientific evidence pointing to human health or environmental problems related to biotech products and has urged the europeans to lift the ban .
in june , the war of words intensified when u.s. president george bush accused the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight because europe refused to accept gm crops , which often grow faster and are more disease-resistant than normal crops .
eu labeling program angers u.s. last month , in what was seen as a first step towards lifting the moratorium and easing trade relations with the united states , eu farm ministers approved new labeling regulations for biotech food that would eventually open up the european market to gm food .
the regulation , expected to come into force next spring , would apply to foodstuffs at every stage of production and would include all products that contain more than 0.9 percent of gmos .
producers would have six months to label their products accordingly .
the measure has been touted by the eu as restoring consumer confidence about the safety of gm products and on monday it also cited a survey conducted by u.s. television station abc in july which said 92 percent of the american public was in favor of biotech crop labeling .
it has however failed to win over the u.s. government , which complains its products would also have to be mandatorily tagged .
american farming organizations say being forced to use " gmo warning labels " on their products amounts to unfair trade barriers and involves high costs .
the latest spat over transatlantic biotech trade coincides with another potential trade dispute brewing between the europe and the united states , this time over the eu ’ s push for global brand protection of famous food such as gorgonzola and drinks like cognac .
though eu member states failed on monday to come up with a final list of its most well-known culinary treats , the united states has been upset with what it sees as europe ’ s insistence on using geographical labels as a means to restrict market access . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

whereas previously the shootings and explosions carried out by unknown guerillas in the streets of the war-torn country have concentrated on the occupying forces , this latest targeting of the u.n. spreads the fallout over the international arena .
envoy included in mounting dead the attack , which took place at about 16:40 local time , brought down three floors of the concrete building , injuring many of those who were at work there and killing 17 , including the u.n. 's special representative to baghdad , sergio vieira de mello .
vieira de mello was trapped in the wreckage of the building long after the bomb struck ; his body was recovered by u.s. soldiers who rushed to the scene .
the u.n. building , a former hotel , had recently seen an increase in security before what u.s. officials at the scene believed to be a possible suicide attack by a person or persons in a large vehicle loaded with explosives .
eyewitnesses to the destruction said the main force of the explosion centered on the point of the building directly under vieira de mello 's office window .
a u.n. spokesman in baghdad , salim lone , made a statement soon after , calling the explosion " an unspeakable crime against people from all over the world who have come here to help the people of iraq . "
in new york , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan 's spokesman fred eckhard described the attack as " a tragedy , i think , not only personally but also a setback politically for the u.n. mission . "
loss felt throughout u.n.
" the loss of sergio vieira de mello is a bitter blow to the united nations and to me personally , " kofi annan said in a press conference .
" the death of any colleague is hard to bear , but i can think of no one we could less afford to spare than sergio . "
the united nations security council issued a statement saying : " this horrible attack , aimed at undermining the vital role of the u.n. in iraq , will not affect our determination .
we will stay united against such attacks and to help the iraqi people restore peace and stability to their country . "
enemies of the people president george w. bush told assembled members of the media at the white house , " the terrorists have again shown their contempt for the innocent , shown their fear of progress and hatred for peace .
they are the enemies of the people of iraq , the enemies of every nation that seeks to help the iraqi people . "
he added , " by their tactics and targets these murderers reveal themselves once more as enemies of the civilized world . "
the ramifications will not only stretch as far as the united nations and the organization 's efforts to aid the rebuilding of iraq and the return to normal life after years of sanctions and war but to the whole of the international community .
an act against the united nations could well be seen as a serious escalation of violence that could drag many world powers , including the european union , into a concerted diplomatic effort and , possibly , unwanted and messy military involvement .
the bombing is only the latest attack on non-military targets in iraq .
oil , water and electricity lines were attacked by what coalition spokesman called saboteurs over the weekend , while earlier this month , a car bomb exploded outside the jordanian embassy in baghdad , leaving 10 people dead . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

schools in three states are offering muslim students a chance to learn about their faith in the german language instead of in their mother tongue , in a move that ’ s hoped to contribute towards better integration . as schools in germany get ready to welcome back students after six long weeks of summer vacation , a few in berlin , lower saxony and bavaria feature a new subject on their curriculum - islamic education .
the idea isn ’ t exactly new .
in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .

the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .

" the parents will decide whether they want to send their children to the class , " he said , but added " we ’ re hoping it will contribute towards integration , tolerance and more understanding of the religion . "
the classes , weszling said , would deal more with the factual aspects of the faith rather than the practice and belief .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier stressed earlier this year at a press conference , the islamic education model at a school in erlangen was based on close cooperation with muslims living permanently in bavaria and receptive to integration .
she said it gave priority to " values laid down in the constitution such as human dignity , freedom , equality and tolerance . "
the minister added the aim was to " allow muslim students a suitable offer in their schools to learn more about their own faith . "
lessons in german can ensure transparency islamic instruction in german may be a new feature , but private lessons have existed in germany since the first turkish immigrants began arriving in the 1960s and are now offered by teachers across the country in arabic and bosnian as well .
however the discovery of the hamburg terror cell and germany ’ s subsequent clampdown on islamist and extremist organizations in the country , have heightened concerns about extremist views trickling into lessons conducted by islamic organizations in koran schools and back rooms of mosques .
officials stress that drawing the state into the issue will ensure it a greater degree of transparency .
" when islamic classes are held in german and under the state-school board , we know what gets taught , " social democrat ute vogt , head of the domestic policy committee in germany ’ s parliament said last year during the height of the debate . " it ’ s important for the state to have control so that there ’ s no possibility islamic education could turn into an anti-democratic movement , " hans-gert lange , spokesman for the federal office for the protection of the constitution told deutsche welle .
no legitimate muslim representative but it ’ s not just security concerns that have delayed efforts so far in getting islamic education well off the ground .
most states interested in offering the subject in german complain there ’ s no legitimate representative on the muslim side such as is the case with the church , who they can deal with in shaping religious lessons .
" it ’ s a very fundamental problem , " thomas john of berlin ’ s education ministry said .
" there are so many sunni , shiite and alewites groups .
it ’ s difficult to find a unified voice .
we can only hope the muslims can come to an agreement about that . "
unlike in france , where a recently-formed national council for muslims represents the country ’ s five-million community and deals directly with the french state on all issues , germany has a bunch of splintered islamic organizations , all with their own agenda and often in competition with each other .
but ali kizilkaya the chairman of the council of muslims , one of the largest organizations , said there were enough muslim representatives the german state could talk to if it was interested .

schools in three states are offering muslim students a chance to learn about their faith in the german language instead of in their mother tongue , in a move that ’ s hoped to contribute towards better integration . as schools in germany get ready to welcome back students after six long weeks of summer vacation , a few in berlin , lower saxony and bavaria feature a new subject on their curriculum - islamic education .
the idea isn ’ t exactly new .
in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .
but germany ’ s complex federal system of education , whereby education remains a prerogative of the länder or states , has meant that the proposal couldn ’ t be applied across the board .
the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .
" contributing towards integration and tolerance " the number of states offering islamic education in german has been growing gradually .
the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to 800,000 muslims , has sponsored optional islamic religion instruction classes as a sort of test run in 24 schools since 1999 . last year , in a rare move , berlin , lower saxony and bavaria committed themselves to introducing concrete islamic education in the german language in close cooperation with islamic organizations in the country .
while berlin got off to a head start with the subject already offered in around 20 schools and now being extended to 30 this week , lower saxony and bavaria are treading new ground with it .
mr. weszling , a spokesman at the education ministry in lower saxony , home to about 40,000 muslim students , told deutsche welle the model was initially being tested on eight primary schools in the state and had been hammered out together with islamic organizations .

now , to prove their case , they have announced they will take dna tests . the car , an old , rusty vw beetle , stands close to the museum .
a small information board next to it explains how the car 's owner , charles lindbergh , used it to travel the world .
africa , europe , the middle east - lindbergh was , apart from a world-famous pilot , an enthusiastic driver .
two weeks ago , three germans announced they , too , had spent time in that very same car with charles lindbergh - who they now claim is their father . the news came both as a surprise , both to the lindbergh museum in little falls , minnesota and lindbergh 's legitimate family in the united states .
there , lindbergh was married to writer anne morrow , with whom he had six children .
the three germans , astrid bouteil , dyrk and david hesshaimer who say lindbergh is their father , claim the pilot also had a clandestine relationship with their mother , brigitte hessheimer from munich , who he visited regularly under the pseudonym careu kent .
they have now announced they want to take genetic tests to prove it . love letters in the attic it all began back in the 1980s when the middle child , astrid bouteil , began investigating the life of the mysterious man she knew as her father , a man who would stay with the hessheimers regularly but never for more than two weeks .
in the family attic , bouteil , who now lives in paris , the city in which lindbergh landed after traversing the atlantic on his legendary solo flight , found 112 letters allegedly written by lindbergh to her mother , brigitte hessheimer .
on confronting her mother with the letters , hessheimer was said to have burst into tears .
the children promised to keep the secret until both their mother and lindbergh 's wife had deceased . bouteil and her two brothers support their case with pictures of lindbergh and his second family in munich and their own faces which bear a remarkable likeness to the pilot .
all three insist they have no interest in lindbergh 's estate or legacy but that they only wish to set the record straight .
" to discover your own identity is a fundamental desire of every person . "
astrid bouteil told the süddeutsche zeitung , which first reported on the case earlier this month .
" deep down everyone wants to know who their father is . " the three germans say they spent little time with their father , but that the moments they had with him were particularly intensive .
all three can remember details such as how lindbergh wriggled his ears or his shoes , which were so big , that the children put puppets in them at night . " hauntingly familiar " however , the germans allegations have also been met with skepticism , in particular in the united states .
here , at least a dozen men have claimed in the past to be lindbergh 's first son , believed to have been murdered as a baby back in 1932 .
marlene white , executive director of the lindbergh foundation , whose president is lindbergh 's daughter reeve , told stern magazine the family refused to comment .
" it is not the first time that people claim charles lindbergh is their father " . but an american grandson of lindbergh has said he thought it could be possible that the germans were telling the truth as they looked so " hauntingly familiar . "
he has now declared he will take up the germans ' offer to go through with dna tests , and will submit to one himself . " i 'm not speaking for the lindbergh family but only for myself - i believe it is possible -lrb- they are the lindbergh children -rrb- , " morgan lindbergh , whose father jon , was the second child of charles and anne morrow lindbergh , told reuters in a telephone interview . a. scott berg , author of a prize-winning biography of lindbergh , said the story was possible but unlikely .
" i 'm happy to believe that their mother told them charles lindbergh was their father , " berg said in an interview with stern magazine .
" i do n't know anything about this woman 's state .
it certainly was n't easy to raise three children in the 1950s without a father . " ties to goering lindbergh came to fame as the first person to fly alone across the atlantic , from new york to paris , in 1927 .
during the 33-hour-long flight , people across the world followed his trip on the radio , while the united states played the french national anthem on his arrival in paris . his widespread popularity was overshadowed by lindbergh 's pre-war sympathy for nazi germany and ties with luftwaffe leader hermann goering , but he later changed his views and was largely rehabilitated . linbergh met brigitte hessheimer , a munich hat maker , in 1957 .
lindbergh allegedly spent up to two weeks three times a year in munich until 1974 .
weakened by cancer , lindbergh 's last visit was in 1973 , one year before his death .
" i 'm losing strength every day " , he wrote in his last letter to hessheimer .
" it 's hard for me to write .

military and humanitarian aid should be separate , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces to protect civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .

" we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .
first the military enters , then the aid organizations follow up with their humanitarian assistance ; the two tasks can not be combined . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.08.2003 u.s. lodges wto complaint against europe over gm food großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : genetically modified and coming soon to a supermarket near you ?
the united states has formally asked the world trade organization to declare the eu ’ s refusal to import most genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- as illegal . backed by canada and argentina , the united states on monday pushed ahead with filing a formal complaint with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , requesting it to set up an arbitration panel to investigate the united states ' ongoing trade row with the european union .
the move marks the latest round in the lengthy transatlantic dispute sparked by the eu ’ s ban on the import of gm foods and grains and a mandatory labeling program introduced last month on gm food and animal feed .
it also raises the prospect of a fresh trade war ahead of crucial world trade talks in mexico .
though wto rules allow the eu , as the defendant , temporarily to block the move , the panel will automatically be formed when washington repeats its request at the next wto meeting on august 29 .
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy defended the eu ’ s stance .
" we regret this move to an unnecessary litigation , " he said in a statement .
" the eu ’ s regulatory system for gmos is clear , transparent , reasonable and non-discriminatory . "
lamy added he was confident the wto would overturn the u.s. complaint .
eu environment minister margot wallstrom warned the u.s. move could backfire .
" there should be no doubt that it is not our intention to create trade barriers .
but my concern is that this request will muddy the waters of the debate in europe .
we have to create confidence among citizens for gmos and then allow them to choose . "
u.s. hit by eu ban on gm imports the u.s. , the world leader in biotech crops , say its gm exports to the eu have been unfairly hit by a moratorium imposed by the bloc on farming and the import of gm food and grain in 1998 , with u.s. corn farmers complaining they lose about € 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
at the heart of the debate lie the eu ’ s safety concerns over gm technology , which prompted the moratorium in the first place .
officials and environmentalists in the 15-member bloc have repeatedly voiced concerns about the health risks and the risk to the environment posed by gm crops .
critics in the eu have also stressed that not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
washington however argues there is no scientific evidence pointing to human health or environmental problems related to biotech products and has urged the europeans to lift the ban .
in june , the war of words intensified when u.s. president george bush accused the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight because europe refused to accept gm crops , which often grow faster and are more disease-resistant than normal crops .
eu labeling program angers u.s. last month , in what was seen as a first step towards lifting the moratorium and easing trade relations with the united states , eu farm ministers approved new labeling regulations for biotech food that would eventually open up the european market to gm food .
the regulation , expected to come into force next spring , would apply to foodstuffs at every stage of production and would include all products that contain more than 0.9 percent of gmos .
producers would have six months to label their products accordingly .
the measure has been touted by the eu as restoring consumer confidence about the safety of gm products and on monday it also cited a survey conducted by u.s. television station abc in july which said 92 percent of the american public was in favor of biotech crop labeling .
it has however failed to win over the u.s. government , which complains its products would also have to be mandatorily tagged .
american farming organizations say being forced to use " gmo warning labels " on their products amounts to unfair trade barriers and involves high costs .
the latest spat over transatlantic biotech trade coincides with another potential trade dispute brewing between the europe and the united states , this time over the eu ’ s push for global brand protection of famous food such as gorgonzola and drinks like cognac .
though eu member states failed on monday to come up with a final list of its most well-known culinary treats , the united states has been upset with what it sees as europe ’ s insistence on using geographical labels as a means to restrict market access . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

now , to prove their case , they have announced they will take dna tests . the car , an old , rusty vw beetle , stands close to the museum .
a small information board next to it explains how the car 's owner , charles lindbergh , used it to travel the world .
africa , europe , the middle east - lindbergh was , apart from a world-famous pilot , an enthusiastic driver .
two weeks ago , three germans announced they , too , had spent time in that very same car with charles lindbergh - who they now claim is their father . the news came both as a surprise , both to the lindbergh museum in little falls , minnesota and lindbergh 's legitimate family in the united states .
there , lindbergh was married to writer anne morrow , with whom he had six children .
the three germans , astrid bouteil , dyrk and david hesshaimer who say lindbergh is their father , claim the pilot also had a clandestine relationship with their mother , brigitte hessheimer from munich , who he visited regularly under the pseudonym careu kent .
they have now announced they want to take genetic tests to prove it . love letters in the attic it all began back in the 1980s when the middle child , astrid bouteil , began investigating the life of the mysterious man she knew as her father , a man who would stay with the hessheimers regularly but never for more than two weeks .
in the family attic , bouteil , who now lives in paris , the city in which lindbergh landed after traversing the atlantic on his legendary solo flight , found 112 letters allegedly written by lindbergh to her mother , brigitte hessheimer .
on confronting her mother with the letters , hessheimer was said to have burst into tears .
the children promised to keep the secret until both their mother and lindbergh 's wife had deceased . bouteil and her two brothers support their case with pictures of lindbergh and his second family in munich and their own faces which bear a remarkable likeness to the pilot .
all three insist they have no interest in lindbergh 's estate or legacy but that they only wish to set the record straight .
" to discover your own identity is a fundamental desire of every person . "
astrid bouteil told the süddeutsche zeitung , which first reported on the case earlier this month .
" deep down everyone wants to know who their father is . " the three germans say they spent little time with their father , but that the moments they had with him were particularly intensive .
all three can remember details such as how lindbergh wriggled his ears or his shoes , which were so big , that the children put puppets in them at night . " hauntingly familiar " however , the germans allegations have also been met with skepticism , in particular in the united states .
here , at least a dozen men have claimed in the past to be lindbergh 's first son , believed to have been murdered as a baby back in 1932 .
marlene white , executive director of the lindbergh foundation , whose president is lindbergh 's daughter reeve , told stern magazine the family refused to comment .
" it is not the first time that people claim charles lindbergh is their father " . but an american grandson of lindbergh has said he thought it could be possible that the germans were telling the truth as they looked so " hauntingly familiar . "
he has now declared he will take up the germans ' offer to go through with dna tests , and will submit to one himself . " i 'm not speaking for the lindbergh family but only for myself - i believe it is possible -lrb- they are the lindbergh children -rrb- , " morgan lindbergh , whose father jon , was the second child of charles and anne morrow lindbergh , told reuters in a telephone interview . a. scott berg , author of a prize-winning biography of lindbergh , said the story was possible but unlikely .
" i 'm happy to believe that their mother told them charles lindbergh was their father , " berg said in an interview with stern magazine .
" i do n't know anything about this woman 's state .
it certainly was n't easy to raise three children in the 1950s without a father . " ties to goering lindbergh came to fame as the first person to fly alone across the atlantic , from new york to paris , in 1927 .
during the 33-hour-long flight , people across the world followed his trip on the radio , while the united states played the french national anthem on his arrival in paris . his widespread popularity was overshadowed by lindbergh 's pre-war sympathy for nazi germany and ties with luftwaffe leader hermann goering , but he later changed his views and was largely rehabilitated . linbergh met brigitte hessheimer , a munich hat maker , in 1957 .
lindbergh allegedly spent up to two weeks three times a year in munich until 1974 .
weakened by cancer , lindbergh 's last visit was in 1973 , one year before his death .

now , to prove their case , they have announced they will take dna tests . the car , an old , rusty vw beetle , stands close to the museum .
a small information board next to it explains how the car 's owner , charles lindbergh , used it to travel the world .
africa , europe , the middle east - lindbergh was , apart from a world-famous pilot , an enthusiastic driver .
two weeks ago , three germans announced they , too , had spent time in that very same car with charles lindbergh - who they now claim is their father . the news came both as a surprise , both to the lindbergh museum in little falls , minnesota and lindbergh 's legitimate family in the united states .
there , lindbergh was married to writer anne morrow , with whom he had six children .
the three germans , astrid bouteil , dyrk and david hesshaimer who say lindbergh is their father , claim the pilot also had a clandestine relationship with their mother , brigitte hessheimer from munich , who he visited regularly under the pseudonym careu kent .
they have now announced they want to take genetic tests to prove it . love letters in the attic it all began back in the 1980s when the middle child , astrid bouteil , began investigating the life of the mysterious man she knew as her father , a man who would stay with the hessheimers regularly but never for more than two weeks .
in the family attic , bouteil , who now lives in paris , the city in which lindbergh landed after traversing the atlantic on his legendary solo flight , found 112 letters allegedly written by lindbergh to her mother , brigitte hessheimer .
on confronting her mother with the letters , hessheimer was said to have burst into tears .
the children promised to keep the secret until both their mother and lindbergh 's wife had deceased . bouteil and her two brothers support their case with pictures of lindbergh and his second family in munich and their own faces which bear a remarkable likeness to the pilot .
all three insist they have no interest in lindbergh 's estate or legacy but that they only wish to set the record straight .
" to discover your own identity is a fundamental desire of every person . "
astrid bouteil told the süddeutsche zeitung , which first reported on the case earlier this month .
" deep down everyone wants to know who their father is . " the three germans say they spent little time with their father , but that the moments they had with him were particularly intensive .
all three can remember details such as how lindbergh wriggled his ears or his shoes , which were so big , that the children put puppets in them at night . " hauntingly familiar " however , the germans allegations have also been met with skepticism , in particular in the united states .
here , at least a dozen men have claimed in the past to be lindbergh 's first son , believed to have been murdered as a baby back in 1932 .
marlene white , executive director of the lindbergh foundation , whose president is lindbergh 's daughter reeve , told stern magazine the family refused to comment .
" it is not the first time that people claim charles lindbergh is their father " . but an american grandson of lindbergh has said he thought it could be possible that the germans were telling the truth as they looked so " hauntingly familiar . "
he has now declared he will take up the germans ' offer to go through with dna tests , and will submit to one himself . " i 'm not speaking for the lindbergh family but only for myself - i believe it is possible -lrb- they are the lindbergh children -rrb- , " morgan lindbergh , whose father jon , was the second child of charles and anne morrow lindbergh , told reuters in a telephone interview . a. scott berg , author of a prize-winning biography of lindbergh , said the story was possible but unlikely .
" i 'm happy to believe that their mother told them charles lindbergh was their father , " berg said in an interview with stern magazine .
" i do n't know anything about this woman 's state .
it certainly was n't easy to raise three children in the 1950s without a father . " ties to goering lindbergh came to fame as the first person to fly alone across the atlantic , from new york to paris , in 1927 .
during the 33-hour-long flight , people across the world followed his trip on the radio , while the united states played the french national anthem on his arrival in paris . his widespread popularity was overshadowed by lindbergh 's pre-war sympathy for nazi germany and ties with luftwaffe leader hermann goering , but he later changed his views and was largely rehabilitated . linbergh met brigitte hessheimer , a munich hat maker , in 1957 .
lindbergh allegedly spent up to two weeks three times a year in munich until 1974 .
weakened by cancer , lindbergh 's last visit was in 1973 , one year before his death .
" i 'm losing strength every day " , he wrote in his last letter to hessheimer .
" it 's hard for me to write .

schools in three states are offering muslim students a chance to learn about their faith in the german language instead of in their mother tongue , in a move that ’ s hoped to contribute towards better integration . as schools in germany get ready to welcome back students after six long weeks of summer vacation , a few in berlin , lower saxony and bavaria feature a new subject on their curriculum - islamic education .
the idea isn ’ t exactly new .
in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .
but germany ’ s complex federal system of education , whereby education remains a prerogative of the länder or states , has meant that the proposal couldn ’ t be applied across the board .
the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .
" contributing towards integration and tolerance " the number of states offering islamic education in german has been growing gradually .
the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to 800,000 muslims , has sponsored optional islamic religion instruction classes as a sort of test run in 24 schools since 1999 . last year , in a rare move , berlin , lower saxony and bavaria committed themselves to introducing concrete islamic education in the german language in close cooperation with islamic organizations in the country .
while berlin got off to a head start with the subject already offered in around 20 schools and now being extended to 30 this week , lower saxony and bavaria are treading new ground with it .
mr. weszling , a spokesman at the education ministry in lower saxony , home to about 40,000 muslim students , told deutsche welle the model was initially being tested on eight primary schools in the state and had been hammered out together with islamic organizations .
" the parents will decide whether they want to send their children to the class , " he said , but added " we ’ re hoping it will contribute towards integration , tolerance and more understanding of the religion . "
the classes , weszling said , would deal more with the factual aspects of the faith rather than the practice and belief .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier stressed earlier this year at a press conference , the islamic education model at a school in erlangen was based on close cooperation with muslims living permanently in bavaria and receptive to integration .
she said it gave priority to " values laid down in the constitution such as human dignity , freedom , equality and tolerance . "
the minister added the aim was to " allow muslim students a suitable offer in their schools to learn more about their own faith . "
lessons in german can ensure transparency islamic instruction in german may be a new feature , but private lessons have existed in germany since the first turkish immigrants began arriving in the 1960s and are now offered by teachers across the country in arabic and bosnian as well .
however the discovery of the hamburg terror cell and germany ’ s subsequent clampdown on islamist and extremist organizations in the country , have heightened concerns about extremist views trickling into lessons conducted by islamic organizations in koran schools and back rooms of mosques .
officials stress that drawing the state into the issue will ensure it a greater degree of transparency .
" when islamic classes are held in german and under the state-school board , we know what gets taught , " social democrat ute vogt , head of the domestic policy committee in germany ’ s parliament said last year during the height of the debate . " it ’ s important for the state to have control so that there ’ s no possibility islamic education could turn into an anti-democratic movement , " hans-gert lange , spokesman for the federal office for the protection of the constitution told deutsche welle .
no legitimate muslim representative but it ’ s not just security concerns that have delayed efforts so far in getting islamic education well off the ground .
most states interested in offering the subject in german complain there ’ s no legitimate representative on the muslim side such as is the case with the church , who they can deal with in shaping religious lessons .
" it ’ s a very fundamental problem , " thomas john of berlin ’ s education ministry said .
" there are so many sunni , shiite and alewites groups .
it ’ s difficult to find a unified voice .
we can only hope the muslims can come to an agreement about that . "
unlike in france , where a recently-formed national council for muslims represents the country ’ s five-million community and deals directly with the french state on all issues , germany has a bunch of splintered islamic organizations , all with their own agenda and often in competition with each other .
but ali kizilkaya the chairman of the council of muslims , one of the largest organizations , said there were enough muslim representatives the german state could talk to if it was interested .
" we have the impression that all models are headed towards not allowing muslims to participate , " he told news agency afp . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows what germans think about islam a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 19.08.2003 aid organizations criticize germany ’ s afghanistan plans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebuilding afghanistan is a humanitarian goal , not a military one .
military and humanitarian aid should be separate , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces to protect civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .
first the military enters , then the aid organizations follow up with their humanitarian assistance ; the two tasks can not be combined . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

whereas previously the shootings and explosions carried out by unknown guerillas in the streets of the war-torn country have concentrated on the occupying forces , this latest targeting of the u.n. spreads the fallout over the international arena .
envoy included in mounting dead the attack , which took place at about 16:40 local time , brought down three floors of the concrete building , injuring many of those who were at work there and killing 17 , including the u.n. 's special representative to baghdad , sergio vieira de mello .
vieira de mello was trapped in the wreckage of the building long after the bomb struck ; his body was recovered by u.s. soldiers who rushed to the scene .
the u.n. building , a former hotel , had recently seen an increase in security before what u.s. officials at the scene believed to be a possible suicide attack by a person or persons in a large vehicle loaded with explosives .
eyewitnesses to the destruction said the main force of the explosion centered on the point of the building directly under vieira de mello 's office window .
a u.n. spokesman in baghdad , salim lone , made a statement soon after , calling the explosion " an unspeakable crime against people from all over the world who have come here to help the people of iraq . "

" the loss of sergio vieira de mello is a bitter blow to the united nations and to me personally , " kofi annan said in a press conference .
" the death of any colleague is hard to bear , but i can think of no one we could less afford to spare than sergio . "
the united nations security council issued a statement saying : " this horrible attack , aimed at undermining the vital role of the u.n. in iraq , will not affect our determination .
we will stay united against such attacks and to help the iraqi people restore peace and stability to their country . "
enemies of the people president george w. bush told assembled members of the media at the white house , " the terrorists have again shown their contempt for the innocent , shown their fear of progress and hatred for peace .
they are the enemies of the people of iraq , the enemies of every nation that seeks to help the iraqi people . "
he added , " by their tactics and targets these murderers reveal themselves once more as enemies of the civilized world . "
the ramifications will not only stretch as far as the united nations and the organization 's efforts to aid the rebuilding of iraq and the return to normal life after years of sanctions and war but to the whole of the international community .

fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .
the group is expected to leave for germany on tuesday . german and malian authorities have confirmed that the fourteen european tourists , kidnapped by an islamic outfit in north africa for almost six months , are free and safe .
the german foreign ministry said late monday evening the group , which include nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were freed by their kidnappers near the city of tessalit in northern mali .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , a key official in the negotiating process , praised the malian authorities for their cooperation .
" this was great negotiating skill by the mali president -lrb- amadou toumani toure -rrb- , " chrobog told a german television station from the malian capital of bamako .
" the president confirmed to me that all the hostages are well .
so that is also a relief , it seems that no one has been hurt , " chrobog added .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said chrobog had told him the freed hostages were in the care of german authorities in mali on tuesday evening .
schröder commended the cooperation with the algerian and malian authorities and offered the countries help in apprehending the kidnappers and in combating terrorism .
the hostages are believed to be heading towards the east malian town of gao in an auto convoy , from where they are expected to be airlifted by an airplane belonging to the german armed forces equipped with doctors and paramedics .
one of the hostages has reportedly spoken to chrobog on the telephone and assured him that the group was in good health .
the group will be brought to bamako and flown to the cologne airport after a meeting with the malian president .
no news on ransom payment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hostages will soon be on their way home .
the 14 were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while travelling in southern algeria .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages , by killing their kidnappers belonging to the islamist outfit , salafist group for preaching and combat .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 .
after the shootout , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month .
german and malian negotiators have been in contact with the kidnappers , who according to german media reports , want $ 5 million for each hostage , though it hasn ’ t been confirmed by the authorities .
however it remains unclear whether any ransom was paid .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday that the efforts to secure the release of the hostages had been " extremely difficult and delicate " right from the beginning .
he however underlined the german government ’ s position to refuse to pay any ransom .
malian officials said last week that kidnappers had demanded a ransom , but that the impoverished country could not pay it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first hostages home await the return of their companions .
dutch foreign minister jaap de hoop scheffer said in an interview with a dutch television station on monday he couldn ’ t confirm whether any ransom had been paid .
" you know that dutch policy is , and will always be , not to pay ransoms when dutch nationals are abducted . "
the minister added , " there was close cooperation with germany , whose nationals made up most of the hostages , and with the netherlands and switzerland .
germany obviously played first fiddle . "
on monday there were conflicting reports about the release of the hostages .
the handing over of the hostages to malian negotiators was delayed apparently after storms and rain hampered the transport of the hostages to the designated location for the hand over .
" hostages should pay for release " in germany meanwhile a debate has already broken out on the apparent foolhardiness of the tourists traveling to a dangerous region without adequate preparations .
parliamentary leader of the conservative opposition of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach has demanded that kidnapped tourists should in certain cases shoulder a share of the costs involved in securing their release .
" those who get themselves in danger through their own frivolity and for the thrill of it , should reckon on with paying for their release , " bosbach told the financial times deutschland .
the minister also criticized that tourists often ignored travel warnings issued by the foreign ministry . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

whereas previously the shootings and explosions carried out by unknown guerillas in the streets of the war-torn country have concentrated on the occupying forces , this latest targeting of the u.n. spreads the fallout over the international arena .
envoy included in mounting dead the attack , which took place at about 16:40 local time , brought down three floors of the concrete building , injuring many of those who were at work there and killing 17 , including the u.n. 's special representative to baghdad , sergio vieira de mello .
vieira de mello was trapped in the wreckage of the building long after the bomb struck ; his body was recovered by u.s. soldiers who rushed to the scene .
the u.n. building , a former hotel , had recently seen an increase in security before what u.s. officials at the scene believed to be a possible suicide attack by a person or persons in a large vehicle loaded with explosives .
eyewitnesses to the destruction said the main force of the explosion centered on the point of the building directly under vieira de mello 's office window .
a u.n. spokesman in baghdad , salim lone , made a statement soon after , calling the explosion " an unspeakable crime against people from all over the world who have come here to help the people of iraq . "
in new york , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan 's spokesman fred eckhard described the attack as " a tragedy , i think , not only personally but also a setback politically for the u.n. mission . "
loss felt throughout u.n.
" the loss of sergio vieira de mello is a bitter blow to the united nations and to me personally , " kofi annan said in a press conference .
" the death of any colleague is hard to bear , but i can think of no one we could less afford to spare than sergio . "
the united nations security council issued a statement saying : " this horrible attack , aimed at undermining the vital role of the u.n. in iraq , will not affect our determination .
we will stay united against such attacks and to help the iraqi people restore peace and stability to their country . "
enemies of the people president george w. bush told assembled members of the media at the white house , " the terrorists have again shown their contempt for the innocent , shown their fear of progress and hatred for peace .
they are the enemies of the people of iraq , the enemies of every nation that seeks to help the iraqi people . "
he added , " by their tactics and targets these murderers reveal themselves once more as enemies of the civilized world . "
the ramifications will not only stretch as far as the united nations and the organization 's efforts to aid the rebuilding of iraq and the return to normal life after years of sanctions and war but to the whole of the international community .
an act against the united nations could well be seen as a serious escalation of violence that could drag many world powers , including the european union , into a concerted diplomatic effort and , possibly , unwanted and messy military involvement .
the bombing is only the latest attack on non-military targets in iraq .
oil , water and electricity lines were attacked by what coalition spokesman called saboteurs over the weekend , while earlier this month , a car bomb exploded outside the jordanian embassy in baghdad , leaving 10 people dead . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the german press on tuesday focused on allegations that the german government had paid ransom to secure the release of hostage in the sahara .
other papers concentrated on the ongoing pension reforms . the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- criticized this comment by the green party parliamentary speaker ludger volmer for saying , “ germany does not pay ransoms - and if it did , it wouldn ’ t admit it . ” the paper called his comments “ extraordinarily clumsy ” and said they indicated to potential kidnappers " that blackmailing the german government out of a few million euros is child ’ s play . ”

the german press on tuesday focused on allegations that the german government had paid ransom to secure the release of hostage in the sahara .
other papers concentrated on the ongoing pension reforms . the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- criticized this comment by the green party parliamentary speaker ludger volmer for saying , “ germany does not pay ransoms - and if it did , it wouldn ’ t admit it . ” the paper called his comments “ extraordinarily clumsy ” and said they indicated to potential kidnappers " that blackmailing the german government out of a few million euros is child ’ s play . ”
the ftd continued : “ the hostage takers have got what they wanted .
it ’ s no solution to let the local government buy them off and then transfer the money under the guise of development aid . ”
it went on to say volmer ’ s remark highlighted the government ’ s dilemma .
“ a state can not give in to the demands of bandits and terror groups , but at the same time it is responsible for every one of its citizens , and this responsibility doesn ’ t end at the german border . ”
the braunschweiger zeitung warned the end of the sahara hostages ’ ordeal didn ’ t mean germany had been given the all-clear ; rather quite the opposite .
it saw the likelihood that the german government has paid a ransom of possibly millions of euro , as an encouragement to terrorists all over the world to lie in wait for new victims .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung agreed .
“ the government shouldn ’ t let itself be blackmailed , certainly not by terrorists or greedy criminals , ” it wrote .
it also commented that questions would now be asked about the degree of responsibility on the part of the hostages themselves .
“ they travelled to a country not renowned for its safety , knowing that someone would come to their aid if the worst came to the worst , ” the paper wrote .
“ one could hold that against them , ” it said , “ but it would be better to do this behind closed doors . ”
several german papers however didn ’ t heed the faz ’ s warning to be discreet .
the hannoversche allgemeine zeitung asked why daredevil “ extreme ” tourists continued to ignore warnings about regional conflict zones crime and violent separatists .
“ the southern sahara has long been considered dangerous territory , ” the daily wrote , “ but for people looking for adventure , this is a kind of encouragement : it ’ s the warnings that make the area interesting . ”
according to the münchner merkur , when the rich travel to poor countries an adventure can all too easily turn into dance with death .
the munich-based paper concluded that the third world ’ s struggle for survival was not compatible with the need rich societies had for fun .
dresden ’ s sächsische zeitung turned to the debate over pension reform in germany and recalled the infamous words of former labor minister norbert blüm that pensions are secure .
“ however , ” the paper wrote , “ this statement now only applies to the pensions of politicians and civil servants . ”
the kölner stadt-anzeiger thought it inevitable that today ’ s employees must make more private provisions for their pensions than at present if contributions to the pension system were to remain stable and a slide into poverty in old age avoided .
at the same time , the paper said , there must be an end to the practice of adapting pension payments to the economic situation .

fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .
the group is expected to leave for germany on tuesday . german and malian authorities have confirmed that the fourteen european tourists , kidnapped by an islamic outfit in north africa for almost six months , are free and safe .
the german foreign ministry said late monday evening the group , which include nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were freed by their kidnappers near the city of tessalit in northern mali .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , a key official in the negotiating process , praised the malian authorities for their cooperation .
" this was great negotiating skill by the mali president -lrb- amadou toumani toure -rrb- , " chrobog told a german television station from the malian capital of bamako .
" the president confirmed to me that all the hostages are well .
so that is also a relief , it seems that no one has been hurt , " chrobog added .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said chrobog had told him the freed hostages were in the care of german authorities in mali on tuesday evening .
schröder commended the cooperation with the algerian and malian authorities and offered the countries help in apprehending the kidnappers and in combating terrorism .
the hostages are believed to be heading towards the east malian town of gao in an auto convoy , from where they are expected to be airlifted by an airplane belonging to the german armed forces equipped with doctors and paramedics .
one of the hostages has reportedly spoken to chrobog on the telephone and assured him that the group was in good health .
the group will be brought to bamako and flown to the cologne airport after a meeting with the malian president .
no news on ransom payment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hostages will soon be on their way home .
the 14 were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while travelling in southern algeria .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages , by killing their kidnappers belonging to the islamist outfit , salafist group for preaching and combat .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 .
after the shootout , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month .
german and malian negotiators have been in contact with the kidnappers , who according to german media reports , want $ 5 million for each hostage , though it hasn ’ t been confirmed by the authorities .
however it remains unclear whether any ransom was paid .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday that the efforts to secure the release of the hostages had been " extremely difficult and delicate " right from the beginning .
he however underlined the german government ’ s position to refuse to pay any ransom .
malian officials said last week that kidnappers had demanded a ransom , but that the impoverished country could not pay it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first hostages home await the return of their companions .
dutch foreign minister jaap de hoop scheffer said in an interview with a dutch television station on monday he couldn ’ t confirm whether any ransom had been paid .
" you know that dutch policy is , and will always be , not to pay ransoms when dutch nationals are abducted . "
the minister added , " there was close cooperation with germany , whose nationals made up most of the hostages , and with the netherlands and switzerland .
germany obviously played first fiddle . "
on monday there were conflicting reports about the release of the hostages .
the handing over of the hostages to malian negotiators was delayed apparently after storms and rain hampered the transport of the hostages to the designated location for the hand over .
" hostages should pay for release " in germany meanwhile a debate has already broken out on the apparent foolhardiness of the tourists traveling to a dangerous region without adequate preparations .
parliamentary leader of the conservative opposition of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach has demanded that kidnapped tourists should in certain cases shoulder a share of the costs involved in securing their release .

" this was great negotiating skill by the mali president -lrb- amadou toumani toure -rrb- , " chrobog told a german television station from the malian capital of bamako .
" the president confirmed to me that all the hostages are well .
so that is also a relief , it seems that no one has been hurt , " chrobog added .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said chrobog had told him the freed hostages were in the care of german authorities in mali on tuesday evening .
schröder commended the cooperation with the algerian and malian authorities and offered the countries help in apprehending the kidnappers and in combating terrorism .
the hostages are believed to be heading towards the east malian town of gao in an auto convoy , from where they are expected to be airlifted by an airplane belonging to the german armed forces equipped with doctors and paramedics .
one of the hostages has reportedly spoken to chrobog on the telephone and assured him that the group was in good health .
the group will be brought to bamako and flown to the cologne airport after a meeting with the malian president .
no news on ransom payment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hostages will soon be on their way home .
the 14 were among 32 european tourists seized in separate incidents in february and march this year while travelling in southern algeria .
algerian commandos managed to free 17 of the hostages , by killing their kidnappers belonging to the islamist outfit , salafist group for preaching and combat .
one of the hostages , a 46-year-old german woman , died of heatstroke on june 28 .
after the shootout , the remaining hostages were moved to neighboring mali last month .
german and malian negotiators have been in contact with the kidnappers , who according to german media reports , want $ 5 million for each hostage , though it hasn ’ t been confirmed by the authorities .
however it remains unclear whether any ransom was paid .
german foreign minister joschka fischer said on monday that the efforts to secure the release of the hostages had been " extremely difficult and delicate " right from the beginning .
he however underlined the german government ’ s position to refuse to pay any ransom .
malian officials said last week that kidnappers had demanded a ransom , but that the impoverished country could not pay it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the first hostages home await the return of their companions .
dutch foreign minister jaap de hoop scheffer said in an interview with a dutch television station on monday he couldn ’ t confirm whether any ransom had been paid .
" you know that dutch policy is , and will always be , not to pay ransoms when dutch nationals are abducted . "
the minister added , " there was close cooperation with germany , whose nationals made up most of the hostages , and with the netherlands and switzerland .
germany obviously played first fiddle . "
on monday there were conflicting reports about the release of the hostages .
the handing over of the hostages to malian negotiators was delayed apparently after storms and rain hampered the transport of the hostages to the designated location for the hand over .
" hostages should pay for release " in germany meanwhile a debate has already broken out on the apparent foolhardiness of the tourists traveling to a dangerous region without adequate preparations .
parliamentary leader of the conservative opposition of the christian democrats , wolfgang bosbach has demanded that kidnapped tourists should in certain cases shoulder a share of the costs involved in securing their release .
" those who get themselves in danger through their own frivolity and for the thrill of it , should reckon on with paying for their release , " bosbach told the financial times deutschland .
the minister also criticized that tourists often ignored travel warnings issued by the foreign ministry . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the united states has formally asked the world trade organization to declare the eu ’ s refusal to import most genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- as illegal . backed by canada and argentina , the united states on monday pushed ahead with filing a formal complaint with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , requesting it to set up an arbitration panel to investigate the united states ' ongoing trade row with the european union .
the move marks the latest round in the lengthy transatlantic dispute sparked by the eu ’ s ban on the import of gm foods and grains and a mandatory labeling program introduced last month on gm food and animal feed .
it also raises the prospect of a fresh trade war ahead of crucial world trade talks in mexico .
though wto rules allow the eu , as the defendant , temporarily to block the move , the panel will automatically be formed when washington repeats its request at the next wto meeting on august 29 .
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy defended the eu ’ s stance .
" we regret this move to an unnecessary litigation , " he said in a statement .
" the eu ’ s regulatory system for gmos is clear , transparent , reasonable and non-discriminatory . "
lamy added he was confident the wto would overturn the u.s. complaint .
eu environment minister margot wallstrom warned the u.s. move could backfire .
" there should be no doubt that it is not our intention to create trade barriers .
but my concern is that this request will muddy the waters of the debate in europe .
we have to create confidence among citizens for gmos and then allow them to choose . "
u.s. hit by eu ban on gm imports the u.s. , the world leader in biotech crops , say its gm exports to the eu have been unfairly hit by a moratorium imposed by the bloc on farming and the import of gm food and grain in 1998 , with u.s. corn farmers complaining they lose about € 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
at the heart of the debate lie the eu ’ s safety concerns over gm technology , which prompted the moratorium in the first place .
officials and environmentalists in the 15-member bloc have repeatedly voiced concerns about the health risks and the risk to the environment posed by gm crops .
critics in the eu have also stressed that not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
washington however argues there is no scientific evidence pointing to human health or environmental problems related to biotech products and has urged the europeans to lift the ban .
in june , the war of words intensified when u.s. president george bush accused the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight because europe refused to accept gm crops , which often grow faster and are more disease-resistant than normal crops .
eu labeling program angers u.s. last month , in what was seen as a first step towards lifting the moratorium and easing trade relations with the united states , eu farm ministers approved new labeling regulations for biotech food that would eventually open up the european market to gm food .
the regulation , expected to come into force next spring , would apply to foodstuffs at every stage of production and would include all products that contain more than 0.9 percent of gmos .
producers would have six months to label their products accordingly .
the measure has been touted by the eu as restoring consumer confidence about the safety of gm products and on monday it also cited a survey conducted by u.s. television station abc in july which said 92 percent of the american public was in favor of biotech crop labeling .
it has however failed to win over the u.s. government , which complains its products would also have to be mandatorily tagged .
american farming organizations say being forced to use " gmo warning labels " on their products amounts to unfair trade barriers and involves high costs .

military and humanitarian aid should be separate , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces to protect civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .
first the military enters , then the aid organizations follow up with their humanitarian assistance ; the two tasks can not be combined . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

whereas previously the shootings and explosions carried out by unknown guerillas in the streets of the war-torn country have concentrated on the occupying forces , this latest targeting of the u.n. spreads the fallout over the international arena .
envoy included in mounting dead the attack , which took place at about 16:40 local time , brought down three floors of the concrete building , injuring many of those who were at work there and killing 17 , including the u.n. 's special representative to baghdad , sergio vieira de mello .
vieira de mello was trapped in the wreckage of the building long after the bomb struck ; his body was recovered by u.s. soldiers who rushed to the scene .
the u.n. building , a former hotel , had recently seen an increase in security before what u.s. officials at the scene believed to be a possible suicide attack by a person or persons in a large vehicle loaded with explosives .
eyewitnesses to the destruction said the main force of the explosion centered on the point of the building directly under vieira de mello 's office window .
a u.n. spokesman in baghdad , salim lone , made a statement soon after , calling the explosion " an unspeakable crime against people from all over the world who have come here to help the people of iraq . "
in new york , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan 's spokesman fred eckhard described the attack as " a tragedy , i think , not only personally but also a setback politically for the u.n. mission . "
loss felt throughout u.n.
" the loss of sergio vieira de mello is a bitter blow to the united nations and to me personally , " kofi annan said in a press conference .
" the death of any colleague is hard to bear , but i can think of no one we could less afford to spare than sergio . "
the united nations security council issued a statement saying : " this horrible attack , aimed at undermining the vital role of the u.n. in iraq , will not affect our determination .
we will stay united against such attacks and to help the iraqi people restore peace and stability to their country . "
enemies of the people president george w. bush told assembled members of the media at the white house , " the terrorists have again shown their contempt for the innocent , shown their fear of progress and hatred for peace .
they are the enemies of the people of iraq , the enemies of every nation that seeks to help the iraqi people . "
he added , " by their tactics and targets these murderers reveal themselves once more as enemies of the civilized world . "
the ramifications will not only stretch as far as the united nations and the organization 's efforts to aid the rebuilding of iraq and the return to normal life after years of sanctions and war but to the whole of the international community .
an act against the united nations could well be seen as a serious escalation of violence that could drag many world powers , including the european union , into a concerted diplomatic effort and , possibly , unwanted and messy military involvement .
the bombing is only the latest attack on non-military targets in iraq .
oil , water and electricity lines were attacked by what coalition spokesman called saboteurs over the weekend , while earlier this month , a car bomb exploded outside the jordanian embassy in baghdad , leaving 10 people dead . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

schools in three states are offering muslim students a chance to learn about their faith in the german language instead of in their mother tongue , in a move that ’ s hoped to contribute towards better integration . as schools in germany get ready to welcome back students after six long weeks of summer vacation , a few in berlin , lower saxony and bavaria feature a new subject on their curriculum - islamic education .
the idea isn ’ t exactly new .
in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .
but germany ’ s complex federal system of education , whereby education remains a prerogative of the länder or states , has meant that the proposal couldn ’ t be applied across the board .
the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .
" contributing towards integration and tolerance " the number of states offering islamic education in german has been growing gradually .
the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to 800,000 muslims , has sponsored optional islamic religion instruction classes as a sort of test run in 24 schools since 1999 . last year , in a rare move , berlin , lower saxony and bavaria committed themselves to introducing concrete islamic education in the german language in close cooperation with islamic organizations in the country .
while berlin got off to a head start with the subject already offered in around 20 schools and now being extended to 30 this week , lower saxony and bavaria are treading new ground with it .
mr. weszling , a spokesman at the education ministry in lower saxony , home to about 40,000 muslim students , told deutsche welle the model was initially being tested on eight primary schools in the state and had been hammered out together with islamic organizations .
" the parents will decide whether they want to send their children to the class , " he said , but added " we ’ re hoping it will contribute towards integration , tolerance and more understanding of the religion . "
the classes , weszling said , would deal more with the factual aspects of the faith rather than the practice and belief .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier stressed earlier this year at a press conference , the islamic education model at a school in erlangen was based on close cooperation with muslims living permanently in bavaria and receptive to integration .
she said it gave priority to " values laid down in the constitution such as human dignity , freedom , equality and tolerance . "
the minister added the aim was to " allow muslim students a suitable offer in their schools to learn more about their own faith . "
lessons in german can ensure transparency islamic instruction in german may be a new feature , but private lessons have existed in germany since the first turkish immigrants began arriving in the 1960s and are now offered by teachers across the country in arabic and bosnian as well .
however the discovery of the hamburg terror cell and germany ’ s subsequent clampdown on islamist and extremist organizations in the country , have heightened concerns about extremist views trickling into lessons conducted by islamic organizations in koran schools and back rooms of mosques .
officials stress that drawing the state into the issue will ensure it a greater degree of transparency .
" when islamic classes are held in german and under the state-school board , we know what gets taught , " social democrat ute vogt , head of the domestic policy committee in germany ’ s parliament said last year during the height of the debate . " it ’ s important for the state to have control so that there ’ s no possibility islamic education could turn into an anti-democratic movement , " hans-gert lange , spokesman for the federal office for the protection of the constitution told deutsche welle .
no legitimate muslim representative but it ’ s not just security concerns that have delayed efforts so far in getting islamic education well off the ground .
most states interested in offering the subject in german complain there ’ s no legitimate representative on the muslim side such as is the case with the church , who they can deal with in shaping religious lessons .
" it ’ s a very fundamental problem , " thomas john of berlin ’ s education ministry said .
" there are so many sunni , shiite and alewites groups .
it ’ s difficult to find a unified voice .
we can only hope the muslims can come to an agreement about that . "
unlike in france , where a recently-formed national council for muslims represents the country ’ s five-million community and deals directly with the french state on all issues , germany has a bunch of splintered islamic organizations , all with their own agenda and often in competition with each other .

mayor ole von beust fired ronald schill after the former judge allegedly threatened to out him . hamburg mayor ole von beust fired the city-state 's controversial interior minister on tuesday .
he said that ' law and order ' man ronald schill had threatened to publicly out beust as a homosexual .
" i have dismissed mr. schill , " beust told reporters .
" i felt forced to dismiss him because schill 's character is not suited to the office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust .
the two men had met to discuss schill 's deputy walter wellinghausen , who beust -lrb- picture -rrb- also dismissed .
wellinghausen , who had been schill 's attorney , has been accused of illegally continuing to collect pay in another capacity after he became privy counselor .
according to beust , schill said the mayor had made his ostensible partner his justice minister and that the two had a homosexual relationship .
" the end of a nightmare " relief was apparent after schill 's sacking was announced .
" for the police , it 's the end of a nightmare , " the head of the police trade union , konrad freiberg , said .
" the dgb emphatically welcomes the fact that ole von beust dismissed interior minister schill and his privy counsel wellinghausen , " german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- regional head erhard pumm announced .
even representatives from schill 's coalition partner , the free democratic party , expressed relief , " we have absolutely no sympathy for mr. schill 's behavior .
we consider mayor von beust 's actions appropriate . "
although ronald barnabas schill disputed beust 's accusations , he said he now wished to retire from politics .
hamburg 's haider the dismissal may mark the end of a short but dramatic career in politics for the hamburg judge .
" judge merciless , " as the german media dubbed him , first drew nationwide attention for the draconic sentences he handed down in the hamburg court he presided over .
the " law-and-order " man formed his own political party , the schill party in july 2000 and campaigned in the september 2001 hamburg elections .
at the same time as fending off comparisons to austria 's rightwing politician jörg haider , schill called for sex offenders to be castrated , suspected drug dealers to be fed emetics to retrieve evidence and convicted foreigners to be deported .
throughout the campaign he was haunted by the three-day jail sentence he had imposed on the two young men in 1999 for disturbing court proceedings .
a hamburg court had already convicted schill of false imprisonment and perversion of justice based on accusations that he delayed a complaint made by the men .
but schill 's hardline appealed to the hamburg electorate .
his party earned 19.4 percent of the votes in the traditionally social democratic city , 25 of the 121 mandates .
suddenly the schill party had the chance to make-up part of the city 's ruling coalition , which after more than three weeks of talks it did , along with the christian democrats and the free democrats .
schill was named interior minister and deputy mayor , while two other party members headed up hamburg ministries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schill gave hamburg cops a makeover .
schill 's first 100 days in office , starting on october 31 , 2001 , were overshadowed by accusations that the senator used cocaine and the furore surrounding the expensive uniforms he ordered to make hamburg 's police look " nicer . "
he submitted hair for a drug test that cleared him of the drug-taking charges .
schill was acquitted of false imprisonment and perversion of justice in december 2001 .
schill , the court said " objectively " perverted justice , but not on purpose , and he had lied .
hours later schill named his defense attorney , walter wellinghausen , privy counselor in the interior ministry .
uproar in parliament the national spotlight turned to schill again in late august 2002 when he addressed the german parliament during a discussion of aid for flooded german regions .
schill used the opportunity to accuse the german governments of the past years of " total failure . "
twice schill 's microphone was turned off after he refused to bring his rant to an end .
across the political spectrum german politicians and the media were scandalized by schill 's behavior .
" this is the last time that such a thing will happen , " hamburg mayor beust announced in response .
beust has been as good as his word , despite the risk that it could have meant the end for his three-way coalition .
so far though , the ruling coalition is standing firm .
after a meeting on tuesday the three parties announced that their cooperation would continue uninterrupted .
schill party chairman mario mettbach said the disgraced interior minister 's predecessor will be named by friday .
the hamburg district attorney is investigating whether to take legal action against schill for coercion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

wellinghausen , who had been schill 's attorney , has been accused of illegally continuing to collect pay in another capacity after he became privy counselor .
according to beust , schill said the mayor had made his ostensible partner his justice minister and that the two had a homosexual relationship .
" the end of a nightmare " relief was apparent after schill 's sacking was announced .
" for the police , it 's the end of a nightmare , " the head of the police trade union , konrad freiberg , said .
" the dgb emphatically welcomes the fact that ole von beust dismissed interior minister schill and his privy counsel wellinghausen , " german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- regional head erhard pumm announced .
even representatives from schill 's coalition partner , the free democratic party , expressed relief , " we have absolutely no sympathy for mr. schill 's behavior .
we consider mayor von beust 's actions appropriate . "
although ronald barnabas schill disputed beust 's accusations , he said he now wished to retire from politics .
hamburg 's haider the dismissal may mark the end of a short but dramatic career in politics for the hamburg judge .
" judge merciless , " as the german media dubbed him , first drew nationwide attention for the draconic sentences he handed down in the hamburg court he presided over .
the " law-and-order " man formed his own political party , the schill party in july 2000 and campaigned in the september 2001 hamburg elections .
at the same time as fending off comparisons to austria 's rightwing politician jörg haider , schill called for sex offenders to be castrated , suspected drug dealers to be fed emetics to retrieve evidence and convicted foreigners to be deported .
throughout the campaign he was haunted by the three-day jail sentence he had imposed on the two young men in 1999 for disturbing court proceedings .
a hamburg court had already convicted schill of false imprisonment and perversion of justice based on accusations that he delayed a complaint made by the men .
but schill 's hardline appealed to the hamburg electorate .
his party earned 19.4 percent of the votes in the traditionally social democratic city , 25 of the 121 mandates .
suddenly the schill party had the chance to make-up part of the city 's ruling coalition , which after more than three weeks of talks it did , along with the christian democrats and the free democrats .
schill was named interior minister and deputy mayor , while two other party members headed up hamburg ministries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schill gave hamburg cops a makeover .
schill 's first 100 days in office , starting on october 31 , 2001 , were overshadowed by accusations that the senator used cocaine and the furore surrounding the expensive uniforms he ordered to make hamburg 's police look " nicer . "
he submitted hair for a drug test that cleared him of the drug-taking charges .
schill was acquitted of false imprisonment and perversion of justice in december 2001 .
schill , the court said " objectively " perverted justice , but not on purpose , and he had lied .
hours later schill named his defense attorney , walter wellinghausen , privy counselor in the interior ministry .
uproar in parliament the national spotlight turned to schill again in late august 2002 when he addressed the german parliament during a discussion of aid for flooded german regions .
schill used the opportunity to accuse the german governments of the past years of " total failure . "
twice schill 's microphone was turned off after he refused to bring his rant to an end .
across the political spectrum german politicians and the media were scandalized by schill 's behavior .
" this is the last time that such a thing will happen , " hamburg mayor beust announced in response .
beust has been as good as his word , despite the risk that it could have meant the end for his three-way coalition .
so far though , the ruling coalition is standing firm .
after a meeting on tuesday the three parties announced that their cooperation would continue uninterrupted .
schill party chairman mario mettbach said the disgraced interior minister 's predecessor will be named by friday .

" we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .
the two can not go hand-in-hand .
first the military enters , then the aid organizations follow up with their humanitarian assistance ; the two tasks can not be combined . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the united states has formally asked the world trade organization to declare the eu ’ s refusal to import most genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- as illegal . backed by canada and argentina , the united states on monday pushed ahead with filing a formal complaint with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , requesting it to set up an arbitration panel to investigate the united states ' ongoing trade row with the european union .
the move marks the latest round in the lengthy transatlantic dispute sparked by the eu ’ s ban on the import of gm foods and grains and a mandatory labeling program introduced last month on gm food and animal feed .
it also raises the prospect of a fresh trade war ahead of crucial world trade talks in mexico .
though wto rules allow the eu , as the defendant , temporarily to block the move , the panel will automatically be formed when washington repeats its request at the next wto meeting on august 29 .
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy defended the eu ’ s stance .
" we regret this move to an unnecessary litigation , " he said in a statement .
" the eu ’ s regulatory system for gmos is clear , transparent , reasonable and non-discriminatory . "
lamy added he was confident the wto would overturn the u.s. complaint .
eu environment minister margot wallstrom warned the u.s. move could backfire .
" there should be no doubt that it is not our intention to create trade barriers .
but my concern is that this request will muddy the waters of the debate in europe .
we have to create confidence among citizens for gmos and then allow them to choose . "
u.s. hit by eu ban on gm imports the u.s. , the world leader in biotech crops , say its gm exports to the eu have been unfairly hit by a moratorium imposed by the bloc on farming and the import of gm food and grain in 1998 , with u.s. corn farmers complaining they lose about € 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
at the heart of the debate lie the eu ’ s safety concerns over gm technology , which prompted the moratorium in the first place .
officials and environmentalists in the 15-member bloc have repeatedly voiced concerns about the health risks and the risk to the environment posed by gm crops .
critics in the eu have also stressed that not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
washington however argues there is no scientific evidence pointing to human health or environmental problems related to biotech products and has urged the europeans to lift the ban .
in june , the war of words intensified when u.s. president george bush accused the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight because europe refused to accept gm crops , which often grow faster and are more disease-resistant than normal crops .
eu labeling program angers u.s. last month , in what was seen as a first step towards lifting the moratorium and easing trade relations with the united states , eu farm ministers approved new labeling regulations for biotech food that would eventually open up the european market to gm food .
the regulation , expected to come into force next spring , would apply to foodstuffs at every stage of production and would include all products that contain more than 0.9 percent of gmos .
producers would have six months to label their products accordingly .
the measure has been touted by the eu as restoring consumer confidence about the safety of gm products and on monday it also cited a survey conducted by u.s. television station abc in july which said 92 percent of the american public was in favor of biotech crop labeling .
it has however failed to win over the u.s. government , which complains its products would also have to be mandatorily tagged .
american farming organizations say being forced to use " gmo warning labels " on their products amounts to unfair trade barriers and involves high costs .
the latest spat over transatlantic biotech trade coincides with another potential trade dispute brewing between the europe and the united states , this time over the eu ’ s push for global brand protection of famous food such as gorgonzola and drinks like cognac .

mayor ole von beust fired ronald schill after the former judge allegedly threatened to out him . hamburg mayor ole von beust fired the city-state 's controversial interior minister on tuesday .
he said that ' law and order ' man ronald schill had threatened to publicly out beust as a homosexual .
" i have dismissed mr. schill , " beust told reporters .
" i felt forced to dismiss him because schill 's character is not suited to the office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust .
the two men had met to discuss schill 's deputy walter wellinghausen , who beust -lrb- picture -rrb- also dismissed .
wellinghausen , who had been schill 's attorney , has been accused of illegally continuing to collect pay in another capacity after he became privy counselor .
according to beust , schill said the mayor had made his ostensible partner his justice minister and that the two had a homosexual relationship .
" the end of a nightmare " relief was apparent after schill 's sacking was announced .
" for the police , it 's the end of a nightmare , " the head of the police trade union , konrad freiberg , said .
" the dgb emphatically welcomes the fact that ole von beust dismissed interior minister schill and his privy counsel wellinghausen , " german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- regional head erhard pumm announced .
even representatives from schill 's coalition partner , the free democratic party , expressed relief , " we have absolutely no sympathy for mr. schill 's behavior .
we consider mayor von beust 's actions appropriate . "
although ronald barnabas schill disputed beust 's accusations , he said he now wished to retire from politics .
hamburg 's haider the dismissal may mark the end of a short but dramatic career in politics for the hamburg judge .
" judge merciless , " as the german media dubbed him , first drew nationwide attention for the draconic sentences he handed down in the hamburg court he presided over .
the " law-and-order " man formed his own political party , the schill party in july 2000 and campaigned in the september 2001 hamburg elections .
at the same time as fending off comparisons to austria 's rightwing politician jörg haider , schill called for sex offenders to be castrated , suspected drug dealers to be fed emetics to retrieve evidence and convicted foreigners to be deported .
throughout the campaign he was haunted by the three-day jail sentence he had imposed on the two young men in 1999 for disturbing court proceedings .
a hamburg court had already convicted schill of false imprisonment and perversion of justice based on accusations that he delayed a complaint made by the men .
but schill 's hardline appealed to the hamburg electorate .
his party earned 19.4 percent of the votes in the traditionally social democratic city , 25 of the 121 mandates .
suddenly the schill party had the chance to make-up part of the city 's ruling coalition , which after more than three weeks of talks it did , along with the christian democrats and the free democrats .
schill was named interior minister and deputy mayor , while two other party members headed up hamburg ministries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schill gave hamburg cops a makeover .
schill 's first 100 days in office , starting on october 31 , 2001 , were overshadowed by accusations that the senator used cocaine and the furore surrounding the expensive uniforms he ordered to make hamburg 's police look " nicer . "
he submitted hair for a drug test that cleared him of the drug-taking charges .
schill was acquitted of false imprisonment and perversion of justice in december 2001 .
schill , the court said " objectively " perverted justice , but not on purpose , and he had lied .
hours later schill named his defense attorney , walter wellinghausen , privy counselor in the interior ministry .
uproar in parliament the national spotlight turned to schill again in late august 2002 when he addressed the german parliament during a discussion of aid for flooded german regions .
schill used the opportunity to accuse the german governments of the past years of " total failure . "
twice schill 's microphone was turned off after he refused to bring his rant to an end .
across the political spectrum german politicians and the media were scandalized by schill 's behavior .
" this is the last time that such a thing will happen , " hamburg mayor beust announced in response .
beust has been as good as his word , despite the risk that it could have meant the end for his three-way coalition .
so far though , the ruling coalition is standing firm .
after a meeting on tuesday the three parties announced that their cooperation would continue uninterrupted .
schill party chairman mario mettbach said the disgraced interior minister 's predecessor will be named by friday .
the hamburg district attorney is investigating whether to take legal action against schill for coercion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

hamburg 's haider the dismissal may mark the end of a short but dramatic career in politics for the hamburg judge .
" judge merciless , " as the german media dubbed him , first drew nationwide attention for the draconic sentences he handed down in the hamburg court he presided over .
the " law-and-order " man formed his own political party , the schill party in july 2000 and campaigned in the september 2001 hamburg elections .
at the same time as fending off comparisons to austria 's rightwing politician jörg haider , schill called for sex offenders to be castrated , suspected drug dealers to be fed emetics to retrieve evidence and convicted foreigners to be deported .
throughout the campaign he was haunted by the three-day jail sentence he had imposed on the two young men in 1999 for disturbing court proceedings .
a hamburg court had already convicted schill of false imprisonment and perversion of justice based on accusations that he delayed a complaint made by the men .
but schill 's hardline appealed to the hamburg electorate .
his party earned 19.4 percent of the votes in the traditionally social democratic city , 25 of the 121 mandates .
suddenly the schill party had the chance to make-up part of the city 's ruling coalition , which after more than three weeks of talks it did , along with the christian democrats and the free democrats .

schools in three states are offering muslim students a chance to learn about their faith in the german language instead of in their mother tongue , in a move that ’ s hoped to contribute towards better integration . as schools in germany get ready to welcome back students after six long weeks of summer vacation , a few in berlin , lower saxony and bavaria feature a new subject on their curriculum - islamic education .
the idea isn ’ t exactly new .
in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .
but germany ’ s complex federal system of education , whereby education remains a prerogative of the länder or states , has meant that the proposal couldn ’ t be applied across the board .
the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .
" contributing towards integration and tolerance " the number of states offering islamic education in german has been growing gradually .
the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to 800,000 muslims , has sponsored optional islamic religion instruction classes as a sort of test run in 24 schools since 1999 . last year , in a rare move , berlin , lower saxony and bavaria committed themselves to introducing concrete islamic education in the german language in close cooperation with islamic organizations in the country .
while berlin got off to a head start with the subject already offered in around 20 schools and now being extended to 30 this week , lower saxony and bavaria are treading new ground with it .
mr. weszling , a spokesman at the education ministry in lower saxony , home to about 40,000 muslim students , told deutsche welle the model was initially being tested on eight primary schools in the state and had been hammered out together with islamic organizations .
" the parents will decide whether they want to send their children to the class , " he said , but added " we ’ re hoping it will contribute towards integration , tolerance and more understanding of the religion . "
the classes , weszling said , would deal more with the factual aspects of the faith rather than the practice and belief .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier stressed earlier this year at a press conference , the islamic education model at a school in erlangen was based on close cooperation with muslims living permanently in bavaria and receptive to integration .
she said it gave priority to " values laid down in the constitution such as human dignity , freedom , equality and tolerance . "
the minister added the aim was to " allow muslim students a suitable offer in their schools to learn more about their own faith . "
lessons in german can ensure transparency islamic instruction in german may be a new feature , but private lessons have existed in germany since the first turkish immigrants began arriving in the 1960s and are now offered by teachers across the country in arabic and bosnian as well .
however the discovery of the hamburg terror cell and germany ’ s subsequent clampdown on islamist and extremist organizations in the country , have heightened concerns about extremist views trickling into lessons conducted by islamic organizations in koran schools and back rooms of mosques .
officials stress that drawing the state into the issue will ensure it a greater degree of transparency .
" when islamic classes are held in german and under the state-school board , we know what gets taught , " social democrat ute vogt , head of the domestic policy committee in germany ’ s parliament said last year during the height of the debate . " it ’ s important for the state to have control so that there ’ s no possibility islamic education could turn into an anti-democratic movement , " hans-gert lange , spokesman for the federal office for the protection of the constitution told deutsche welle .
no legitimate muslim representative but it ’ s not just security concerns that have delayed efforts so far in getting islamic education well off the ground .
most states interested in offering the subject in german complain there ’ s no legitimate representative on the muslim side such as is the case with the church , who they can deal with in shaping religious lessons .
" it ’ s a very fundamental problem , " thomas john of berlin ’ s education ministry said .
" there are so many sunni , shiite and alewites groups .
it ’ s difficult to find a unified voice .
we can only hope the muslims can come to an agreement about that . "
unlike in france , where a recently-formed national council for muslims represents the country ’ s five-million community and deals directly with the french state on all issues , germany has a bunch of splintered islamic organizations , all with their own agenda and often in competition with each other .
but ali kizilkaya the chairman of the council of muslims , one of the largest organizations , said there were enough muslim representatives the german state could talk to if it was interested .

schools in three states are offering muslim students a chance to learn about their faith in the german language instead of in their mother tongue , in a move that ’ s hoped to contribute towards better integration . as schools in germany get ready to welcome back students after six long weeks of summer vacation , a few in berlin , lower saxony and bavaria feature a new subject on their curriculum - islamic education .
the idea isn ’ t exactly new .
in the months since germany became known as the launching pad of the september 11 terrorist attacks with the discovery of the hamburg terror cell , politicians from all sides have been advocating better integration of the country ’ s estimated 3.5-million strong muslim community .
proposed measures included standardizing islamic education in the german language .
but germany ’ s complex federal system of education , whereby education remains a prerogative of the länder or states , has meant that the proposal couldn ’ t be applied across the board .
the german constitution states that " religion classes in agreement with the basic tenets of religious communities " should be offered as a full-fledged subject .
german students are required to take religion classes unless they get written permission to take an ethics class instead .
schools so far offer classes in either protestantism , catholicism or judaism and in a latest example , two schools in berlin begin offering buddhism starting this week .
" contributing towards integration and tolerance " the number of states offering islamic education in german has been growing gradually .
the state of north rhine-westphalia , home to 800,000 muslims , has sponsored optional islamic religion instruction classes as a sort of test run in 24 schools since 1999 . last year , in a rare move , berlin , lower saxony and bavaria committed themselves to introducing concrete islamic education in the german language in close cooperation with islamic organizations in the country .
while berlin got off to a head start with the subject already offered in around 20 schools and now being extended to 30 this week , lower saxony and bavaria are treading new ground with it .
mr. weszling , a spokesman at the education ministry in lower saxony , home to about 40,000 muslim students , told deutsche welle the model was initially being tested on eight primary schools in the state and had been hammered out together with islamic organizations .
" the parents will decide whether they want to send their children to the class , " he said , but added " we ’ re hoping it will contribute towards integration , tolerance and more understanding of the religion . "
the classes , weszling said , would deal more with the factual aspects of the faith rather than the practice and belief .
bavarian education minister monika hohlmeier stressed earlier this year at a press conference , the islamic education model at a school in erlangen was based on close cooperation with muslims living permanently in bavaria and receptive to integration .
she said it gave priority to " values laid down in the constitution such as human dignity , freedom , equality and tolerance . "
the minister added the aim was to " allow muslim students a suitable offer in their schools to learn more about their own faith . "
lessons in german can ensure transparency islamic instruction in german may be a new feature , but private lessons have existed in germany since the first turkish immigrants began arriving in the 1960s and are now offered by teachers across the country in arabic and bosnian as well .
however the discovery of the hamburg terror cell and germany ’ s subsequent clampdown on islamist and extremist organizations in the country , have heightened concerns about extremist views trickling into lessons conducted by islamic organizations in koran schools and back rooms of mosques .
officials stress that drawing the state into the issue will ensure it a greater degree of transparency .
" when islamic classes are held in german and under the state-school board , we know what gets taught , " social democrat ute vogt , head of the domestic policy committee in germany ’ s parliament said last year during the height of the debate . " it ’ s important for the state to have control so that there ’ s no possibility islamic education could turn into an anti-democratic movement , " hans-gert lange , spokesman for the federal office for the protection of the constitution told deutsche welle .
no legitimate muslim representative but it ’ s not just security concerns that have delayed efforts so far in getting islamic education well off the ground .
most states interested in offering the subject in german complain there ’ s no legitimate representative on the muslim side such as is the case with the church , who they can deal with in shaping religious lessons .
" it ’ s a very fundamental problem , " thomas john of berlin ’ s education ministry said .
" there are so many sunni , shiite and alewites groups .
it ’ s difficult to find a unified voice .
we can only hope the muslims can come to an agreement about that . "
unlike in france , where a recently-formed national council for muslims represents the country ’ s five-million community and deals directly with the french state on all issues , germany has a bunch of splintered islamic organizations , all with their own agenda and often in competition with each other .
but ali kizilkaya the chairman of the council of muslims , one of the largest organizations , said there were enough muslim representatives the german state could talk to if it was interested .
" we have the impression that all models are headed towards not allowing muslims to participate , " he told news agency afp . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de study shows what germans think about islam a new survey probing german attitudes towards islam has thrown up surprising results - many germans are tolerant towards the religion , but wish muslims living in the country would reciprocate the feeling .

now , to prove their case , they have announced they will take dna tests . the car , an old , rusty vw beetle , stands close to the museum .
a small information board next to it explains how the car 's owner , charles lindbergh , used it to travel the world .
africa , europe , the middle east - lindbergh was , apart from a world-famous pilot , an enthusiastic driver .
two weeks ago , three germans announced they , too , had spent time in that very same car with charles lindbergh - who they now claim is their father . the news came both as a surprise , both to the lindbergh museum in little falls , minnesota and lindbergh 's legitimate family in the united states .
there , lindbergh was married to writer anne morrow , with whom he had six children .
the three germans , astrid bouteil , dyrk and david hesshaimer who say lindbergh is their father , claim the pilot also had a clandestine relationship with their mother , brigitte hessheimer from munich , who he visited regularly under the pseudonym careu kent .
they have now announced they want to take genetic tests to prove it . love letters in the attic it all began back in the 1980s when the middle child , astrid bouteil , began investigating the life of the mysterious man she knew as her father , a man who would stay with the hessheimers regularly but never for more than two weeks .
in the family attic , bouteil , who now lives in paris , the city in which lindbergh landed after traversing the atlantic on his legendary solo flight , found 112 letters allegedly written by lindbergh to her mother , brigitte hessheimer .
on confronting her mother with the letters , hessheimer was said to have burst into tears .
the children promised to keep the secret until both their mother and lindbergh 's wife had deceased . bouteil and her two brothers support their case with pictures of lindbergh and his second family in munich and their own faces which bear a remarkable likeness to the pilot .
all three insist they have no interest in lindbergh 's estate or legacy but that they only wish to set the record straight .
" to discover your own identity is a fundamental desire of every person . "
astrid bouteil told the süddeutsche zeitung , which first reported on the case earlier this month .
" deep down everyone wants to know who their father is . " the three germans say they spent little time with their father , but that the moments they had with him were particularly intensive .
all three can remember details such as how lindbergh wriggled his ears or his shoes , which were so big , that the children put puppets in them at night . " hauntingly familiar " however , the germans allegations have also been met with skepticism , in particular in the united states .
here , at least a dozen men have claimed in the past to be lindbergh 's first son , believed to have been murdered as a baby back in 1932 .
marlene white , executive director of the lindbergh foundation , whose president is lindbergh 's daughter reeve , told stern magazine the family refused to comment .
" it is not the first time that people claim charles lindbergh is their father " . but an american grandson of lindbergh has said he thought it could be possible that the germans were telling the truth as they looked so " hauntingly familiar . "
he has now declared he will take up the germans ' offer to go through with dna tests , and will submit to one himself . " i 'm not speaking for the lindbergh family but only for myself - i believe it is possible -lrb- they are the lindbergh children -rrb- , " morgan lindbergh , whose father jon , was the second child of charles and anne morrow lindbergh , told reuters in a telephone interview . a. scott berg , author of a prize-winning biography of lindbergh , said the story was possible but unlikely .
" i 'm happy to believe that their mother told them charles lindbergh was their father , " berg said in an interview with stern magazine .
" i do n't know anything about this woman 's state .
it certainly was n't easy to raise three children in the 1950s without a father . " ties to goering lindbergh came to fame as the first person to fly alone across the atlantic , from new york to paris , in 1927 .
during the 33-hour-long flight , people across the world followed his trip on the radio , while the united states played the french national anthem on his arrival in paris . his widespread popularity was overshadowed by lindbergh 's pre-war sympathy for nazi germany and ties with luftwaffe leader hermann goering , but he later changed his views and was largely rehabilitated . linbergh met brigitte hessheimer , a munich hat maker , in 1957 .
lindbergh allegedly spent up to two weeks three times a year in munich until 1974 .
weakened by cancer , lindbergh 's last visit was in 1973 , one year before his death .
" i 'm losing strength every day " , he wrote in his last letter to hessheimer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 19.08.2003 german press review : to pay or not to pay ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : times may get tougher for germany 's old as the pension system undergoes reform .
the german press on tuesday focused on allegations that the german government had paid ransom to secure the release of hostage in the sahara .
other papers concentrated on the ongoing pension reforms . the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- criticized this comment by the green party parliamentary speaker ludger volmer for saying , “ germany does not pay ransoms - and if it did , it wouldn ’ t admit it . ” the paper called his comments “ extraordinarily clumsy ” and said they indicated to potential kidnappers " that blackmailing the german government out of a few million euros is child ’ s play . ”
the ftd continued : “ the hostage takers have got what they wanted .
it ’ s no solution to let the local government buy them off and then transfer the money under the guise of development aid . ”
it went on to say volmer ’ s remark highlighted the government ’ s dilemma .
“ a state can not give in to the demands of bandits and terror groups , but at the same time it is responsible for every one of its citizens , and this responsibility doesn ’ t end at the german border . ”
the braunschweiger zeitung warned the end of the sahara hostages ’ ordeal didn ’ t mean germany had been given the all-clear ; rather quite the opposite .
it saw the likelihood that the german government has paid a ransom of possibly millions of euro , as an encouragement to terrorists all over the world to lie in wait for new victims .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung agreed .

the german press on tuesday focused on allegations that the german government had paid ransom to secure the release of hostage in the sahara .
other papers concentrated on the ongoing pension reforms . the financial times deutschland -lrb- ftd -rrb- criticized this comment by the green party parliamentary speaker ludger volmer for saying , “ germany does not pay ransoms - and if it did , it wouldn ’ t admit it . ” the paper called his comments “ extraordinarily clumsy ” and said they indicated to potential kidnappers " that blackmailing the german government out of a few million euros is child ’ s play . ”
the ftd continued : “ the hostage takers have got what they wanted .
it ’ s no solution to let the local government buy them off and then transfer the money under the guise of development aid . ”
it went on to say volmer ’ s remark highlighted the government ’ s dilemma .
“ a state can not give in to the demands of bandits and terror groups , but at the same time it is responsible for every one of its citizens , and this responsibility doesn ’ t end at the german border . ”
the braunschweiger zeitung warned the end of the sahara hostages ’ ordeal didn ’ t mean germany had been given the all-clear ; rather quite the opposite .
it saw the likelihood that the german government has paid a ransom of possibly millions of euro , as an encouragement to terrorists all over the world to lie in wait for new victims .
the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung agreed .
“ the government shouldn ’ t let itself be blackmailed , certainly not by terrorists or greedy criminals , ” it wrote .
it also commented that questions would now be asked about the degree of responsibility on the part of the hostages themselves .

whereas previously the shootings and explosions carried out by unknown guerillas in the streets of the war-torn country have concentrated on the occupying forces , this latest targeting of the u.n. spreads the fallout over the international arena .
envoy included in mounting dead the attack , which took place at about 16:40 local time , brought down three floors of the concrete building , injuring many of those who were at work there and killing 17 , including the u.n. 's special representative to baghdad , sergio vieira de mello .
vieira de mello was trapped in the wreckage of the building long after the bomb struck ; his body was recovered by u.s. soldiers who rushed to the scene .
the u.n. building , a former hotel , had recently seen an increase in security before what u.s. officials at the scene believed to be a possible suicide attack by a person or persons in a large vehicle loaded with explosives .
eyewitnesses to the destruction said the main force of the explosion centered on the point of the building directly under vieira de mello 's office window .
a u.n. spokesman in baghdad , salim lone , made a statement soon after , calling the explosion " an unspeakable crime against people from all over the world who have come here to help the people of iraq . "
in new york , u.n. secretary-general kofi annan 's spokesman fred eckhard described the attack as " a tragedy , i think , not only personally but also a setback politically for the u.n. mission . "
loss felt throughout u.n.
" the loss of sergio vieira de mello is a bitter blow to the united nations and to me personally , " kofi annan said in a press conference .
" the death of any colleague is hard to bear , but i can think of no one we could less afford to spare than sergio . "
the united nations security council issued a statement saying : " this horrible attack , aimed at undermining the vital role of the u.n. in iraq , will not affect our determination .
we will stay united against such attacks and to help the iraqi people restore peace and stability to their country . "
enemies of the people president george w. bush told assembled members of the media at the white house , " the terrorists have again shown their contempt for the innocent , shown their fear of progress and hatred for peace .
they are the enemies of the people of iraq , the enemies of every nation that seeks to help the iraqi people . "
he added , " by their tactics and targets these murderers reveal themselves once more as enemies of the civilized world . "
the ramifications will not only stretch as far as the united nations and the organization 's efforts to aid the rebuilding of iraq and the return to normal life after years of sanctions and war but to the whole of the international community .
an act against the united nations could well be seen as a serious escalation of violence that could drag many world powers , including the european union , into a concerted diplomatic effort and , possibly , unwanted and messy military involvement .
the bombing is only the latest attack on non-military targets in iraq .

fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .
the group is expected to leave for germany on tuesday . german and malian authorities have confirmed that the fourteen european tourists , kidnapped by an islamic outfit in north africa for almost six months , are free and safe .
the german foreign ministry said late monday evening the group , which include nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were freed by their kidnappers near the city of tessalit in northern mali .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , a key official in the negotiating process , praised the malian authorities for their cooperation .
" this was great negotiating skill by the mali president -lrb- amadou toumani toure -rrb- , " chrobog told a german television station from the malian capital of bamako .
" the president confirmed to me that all the hostages are well .
so that is also a relief , it seems that no one has been hurt , " chrobog added .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said chrobog had told him the freed hostages were in the care of german authorities in mali on tuesday evening .
schröder commended the cooperation with the algerian and malian authorities and offered the countries help in apprehending the kidnappers and in combating terrorism .

fourteen european tourists , held hostage by algerian militants in the sahara desert for over five months , have been released .
the group is expected to leave for germany on tuesday . german and malian authorities have confirmed that the fourteen european tourists , kidnapped by an islamic outfit in north africa for almost six months , are free and safe .
the german foreign ministry said late monday evening the group , which include nine germans , four swiss and a dutch national , were freed by their kidnappers near the city of tessalit in northern mali .
german deputy foreign minister jürgen chrobog , a key official in the negotiating process , praised the malian authorities for their cooperation .
" this was great negotiating skill by the mali president -lrb- amadou toumani toure -rrb- , " chrobog told a german television station from the malian capital of bamako .
" the president confirmed to me that all the hostages are well .
so that is also a relief , it seems that no one has been hurt , " chrobog added .
german chancellor gerhard schröder said chrobog had told him the freed hostages were in the care of german authorities in mali on tuesday evening .
schröder commended the cooperation with the algerian and malian authorities and offered the countries help in apprehending the kidnappers and in combating terrorism .

military and humanitarian aid should be separate , say german non-governmental organizations who oppose sending soldiers into the afghan provinces to protect civil reconstruction teams . " we do not work hand-in-hand with the army , " say germany ’ s non-governmental organizations in afghanistan , care deutschland and world hunger help .
the two groups insist on drawing a distinction between the humanitarian assistance they provide and the bundeswehr ’ s military interests in maintaining security and tracking down taliban and al qaeda fighters .
for this reason they are against germany ’ s current plans to send troops to the north afghan town of kunduz as protection for the civilian helpers .
although the aid organizations endorse the planned expansion of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- into the afghan provinces and are generally in favor of germany sending troops to maintain security outside kabul , they do not want to work together with the soldiers .
they do not want to fall under the protection of the army , says bernd baucks , project coordinator for care .
" we categorically reject working with armed protection , " he explains to deutsche welle .
" we want to make sure it is clear that humanitarian help is provided without weapons and that it does not adhere to any sort of military or strategic interests .
we are a purely civil organization . "
baucks says this is the basis of his organization ’ s principles and that the 700-some helpers currently working in afghanistan will refuse to enter regions where they would require military protection .
" we simply say , we can not work there , the prerequisites are not fulfilled . "
maintaining neutrality is difficult task manfred hochwald , project director for world hunger help , sees the issue similarly .
humanitarian aid must remain neutral and should never be used for political gains , he says .
but this is hard to maintain when one considers how active the international military community is in afghanistan , hochwald notes .
not only is the isaf involved in maintaining security in kabul , but there are several thousand u.s. soldiers combing the countryside in search of terrorists .
they are heavily armed and not infrequently engaged in fighting .
as a result the three american reconstruction teams comprised of soldiers and civilians have an especially hard time convincing the afghan people that they are in the country to help , hochwald says .
" it ’ s been our experience that the american reconstruction teams working in afghanistan have all too often aroused the mistrust of the population and have found themselves caught in the midst of internal conflicts because they do not separate military and humanitarian tasks , " hochwald explains and adds , " we are not looking for the taliban ; we are not looking for al qaeda fighters .
we are just trying to help the people . "
securing peace must come first combining civil assistance with military goals leads to an automatic conflict of interest , the world hunger help director says and for this reason opposes the german government plans to send troops into the provinces to protect aid workers .
the civilians would not be able to work effectively and would be at a much higher risk for attacks , says baucks , who suggests sending international troops into regions that have not yet been pacified .
doing so would help pave the way for the aid workers to enter on their own later .
the german government , of course , sees the situation differently .
it wants to send the soldiers into the northern city of kunduz , which is considered relatively safe .
bernd baucks views such a position as an obvious contradiction of the military ’ s priorities .
that the government selects a place of deployment based on the extent to which it has already been secured goes against what the soldiers are in the country to do , namely stop the fighting in the first place .
" we believe there is a great need to first secure peace in the country , because that is the prerequisite for beginning to help with reconstruction , " baucks says .

the united states has formally asked the world trade organization to declare the eu ’ s refusal to import most genetically modified organisms -lrb- gmos -rrb- as illegal . backed by canada and argentina , the united states on monday pushed ahead with filing a formal complaint with the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- , requesting it to set up an arbitration panel to investigate the united states ' ongoing trade row with the european union .
the move marks the latest round in the lengthy transatlantic dispute sparked by the eu ’ s ban on the import of gm foods and grains and a mandatory labeling program introduced last month on gm food and animal feed .
it also raises the prospect of a fresh trade war ahead of crucial world trade talks in mexico .
though wto rules allow the eu , as the defendant , temporarily to block the move , the panel will automatically be formed when washington repeats its request at the next wto meeting on august 29 .
eu trade commissioner pascal lamy defended the eu ’ s stance .
" we regret this move to an unnecessary litigation , " he said in a statement .
" the eu ’ s regulatory system for gmos is clear , transparent , reasonable and non-discriminatory . "
lamy added he was confident the wto would overturn the u.s. complaint .
eu environment minister margot wallstrom warned the u.s. move could backfire .
" there should be no doubt that it is not our intention to create trade barriers .
but my concern is that this request will muddy the waters of the debate in europe .
we have to create confidence among citizens for gmos and then allow them to choose . "
u.s. hit by eu ban on gm imports the u.s. , the world leader in biotech crops , say its gm exports to the eu have been unfairly hit by a moratorium imposed by the bloc on farming and the import of gm food and grain in 1998 , with u.s. corn farmers complaining they lose about € 300 million a year in sales to the eu .
at the heart of the debate lie the eu ’ s safety concerns over gm technology , which prompted the moratorium in the first place .
officials and environmentalists in the 15-member bloc have repeatedly voiced concerns about the health risks and the risk to the environment posed by gm crops .
critics in the eu have also stressed that not enough independent studies have been conducted to prove the gene-altering technology is safe .
washington however argues there is no scientific evidence pointing to human health or environmental problems related to biotech products and has urged the europeans to lift the ban .
in june , the war of words intensified when u.s. president george bush accused the european union of being indirectly responsible for africa ’ s hunger plight because europe refused to accept gm crops , which often grow faster and are more disease-resistant than normal crops .
eu labeling program angers u.s. last month , in what was seen as a first step towards lifting the moratorium and easing trade relations with the united states , eu farm ministers approved new labeling regulations for biotech food that would eventually open up the european market to gm food .
the regulation , expected to come into force next spring , would apply to foodstuffs at every stage of production and would include all products that contain more than 0.9 percent of gmos .
producers would have six months to label their products accordingly .
the measure has been touted by the eu as restoring consumer confidence about the safety of gm products and on monday it also cited a survey conducted by u.s. television station abc in july which said 92 percent of the american public was in favor of biotech crop labeling .
it has however failed to win over the u.s. government , which complains its products would also have to be mandatorily tagged .
american farming organizations say being forced to use " gmo warning labels " on their products amounts to unfair trade barriers and involves high costs .
the latest spat over transatlantic biotech trade coincides with another potential trade dispute brewing between the europe and the united states , this time over the eu ’ s push for global brand protection of famous food such as gorgonzola and drinks like cognac .

mayor ole von beust fired ronald schill after the former judge allegedly threatened to out him . hamburg mayor ole von beust fired the city-state 's controversial interior minister on tuesday .
he said that ' law and order ' man ronald schill had threatened to publicly out beust as a homosexual .
" i have dismissed mr. schill , " beust told reporters .
" i felt forced to dismiss him because schill 's character is not suited to the office . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg mayor ole von beust .
the two men had met to discuss schill 's deputy walter wellinghausen , who beust -lrb- picture -rrb- also dismissed .
wellinghausen , who had been schill 's attorney , has been accused of illegally continuing to collect pay in another capacity after he became privy counselor .
according to beust , schill said the mayor had made his ostensible partner his justice minister and that the two had a homosexual relationship .
" the end of a nightmare " relief was apparent after schill 's sacking was announced .
" for the police , it 's the end of a nightmare , " the head of the police trade union , konrad freiberg , said .
" the dgb emphatically welcomes the fact that ole von beust dismissed interior minister schill and his privy counsel wellinghausen , " german trade union federation -lrb- dgb -rrb- regional head erhard pumm announced .
even representatives from schill 's coalition partner , the free democratic party , expressed relief , " we have absolutely no sympathy for mr. schill 's behavior .
we consider mayor von beust 's actions appropriate . "
although ronald barnabas schill disputed beust 's accusations , he said he now wished to retire from politics .
hamburg 's haider the dismissal may mark the end of a short but dramatic career in politics for the hamburg judge .
" judge merciless , " as the german media dubbed him , first drew nationwide attention for the draconic sentences he handed down in the hamburg court he presided over .
the " law-and-order " man formed his own political party , the schill party in july 2000 and campaigned in the september 2001 hamburg elections .
at the same time as fending off comparisons to austria 's rightwing politician jörg haider , schill called for sex offenders to be castrated , suspected drug dealers to be fed emetics to retrieve evidence and convicted foreigners to be deported .
throughout the campaign he was haunted by the three-day jail sentence he had imposed on the two young men in 1999 for disturbing court proceedings .
a hamburg court had already convicted schill of false imprisonment and perversion of justice based on accusations that he delayed a complaint made by the men .
but schill 's hardline appealed to the hamburg electorate .
his party earned 19.4 percent of the votes in the traditionally social democratic city , 25 of the 121 mandates .
suddenly the schill party had the chance to make-up part of the city 's ruling coalition , which after more than three weeks of talks it did , along with the christian democrats and the free democrats .
schill was named interior minister and deputy mayor , while two other party members headed up hamburg ministries .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schill gave hamburg cops a makeover .
schill 's first 100 days in office , starting on october 31 , 2001 , were overshadowed by accusations that the senator used cocaine and the furore surrounding the expensive uniforms he ordered to make hamburg 's police look " nicer . "
he submitted hair for a drug test that cleared him of the drug-taking charges .
schill was acquitted of false imprisonment and perversion of justice in december 2001 .
schill , the court said " objectively " perverted justice , but not on purpose , and he had lied .
hours later schill named his defense attorney , walter wellinghausen , privy counselor in the interior ministry .
uproar in parliament the national spotlight turned to schill again in late august 2002 when he addressed the german parliament during a discussion of aid for flooded german regions .
schill used the opportunity to accuse the german governments of the past years of " total failure . "
twice schill 's microphone was turned off after he refused to bring his rant to an end .
across the political spectrum german politicians and the media were scandalized by schill 's behavior .
" this is the last time that such a thing will happen , " hamburg mayor beust announced in response .
beust has been as good as his word , despite the risk that it could have meant the end for his three-way coalition .
so far though , the ruling coalition is standing firm .
after a meeting on tuesday the three parties announced that their cooperation would continue uninterrupted .
schill party chairman mario mettbach said the disgraced interior minister 's predecessor will be named by friday .
the hamburg district attorney is investigating whether to take legal action against schill for coercion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the uk has jointly tabled a draft resolution with bulgaria at the un security council calling for an immediate end to sanctions .
the resolution welcomes the steps taken by libya last week to accept responsibility for the bombing of pan am flight 103 and commit to paying compensation to victims ' families .
the security council will debate the resolution on wednesday with a vote expected soon afterwards , but france could block the move as it seeks to get better compensation for another bombing .
the millions likely to be offered to each lockerbie family dwarfs a separate compensation deal france agreed with libya for the families of victims of flight uta 772 , which was blown up over north africa in 1989 .
french veto ?
as one of the five permanent members of the security council , france could veto the resolution .
the british ambassador to the un , emyr jones parry , said he hoped sanctions would be lifted sooner rather than later : " our wish is to see an early vote .
this has been a long , painful , protracted negotiation and especially for the families .
" we believe we 've reached our solution , but of course it 's for every country to decide between now and that vote how we should actually react on the day . "
at a stroke , the new resolution would remove diplomatic and economic sanctions that have been imposed for more than a decade .
although they have been suspended for some time now , libya has continued to suffer from the stigma and inconvenience of a sanctions regime hanging over it .
payment welcomed the draft resolution , which is just one page long , welcomes the letter which the libyan government sent to the security council on friday last week .
the text notes that in the letter , libya accepted responsibility for the actions of its officials in connection with the lockerbie bombing .
it also welcomes the payment of appropriate compensation to the families of the victims , and libya 's renunciation of terrorism .
libyan abdelbaset ali mohmed al-megrahi was jailed for life in january 2001 at a special court in the netherlands and is currently held in glasgow 's barlinnie prison .
his appeal last year was unsuccessful , although he continues to deny any involvement in the bombing that destroyed the airliner .
the attack claimed the lives of 259 passengers and crew and 11 residents of the scottish town below .

twelve suicide bombers were among the 45 people who died as a result of the attacks - the 45th on friday after three months in hospital .
death sentences were handed down to mohamed el omari , 23 , rachid jalil , 27 , yassine lahnech , 22 and hassan taousi - three of whom were believed to have aborted their own suicide missions .
reserve bomber the bbc 's pascale harter , at the trial , said el omari was mobbed by passers-by when he fled from the farah hotel in casablanca after the explosives he was carrying failed to detonate .
the prosecution claimed jalil and taousi ran from their intended targets when they heard the first explosion and took fright .
street vendor lahnech was referred to in the trial as a reserve suicide bomber , recruited to carry out similar attacks elsewhere in the country .
all four defendants come from the impoverished casablanca suburb of sidi moumen , which has been identified as a breeding ground for converts to what the authorities say is a form of radical fundamentalism imported from saudi arabia .
taousi was considered to be a leading member of salafia jihadia - which advocates violence against us interests and jews in morocco .
the authorities believe the group is linked to osama bin laden 's al-qaeda network .
more trials one of four islamic clerics appearing before the judges was sentenced to life imprisonment , with the others getting 30-year sentences .
security at the trial was extremely tight , with defendants lined up behind a bullet-proof glass shield and a metal detector in the courtroom .
when the verdict was announced , defendants cried " god is great ! "
the moroccan authorities say about 700 suspects will eventually be tried under the country 's anti-terrorism laws in connection with the attacks .
a spanish restaurant , the belgian consulate , a jewish community centre and cemetery and a hotel were all targeted in casablanca .

the lecht 2090 centre will give skiers café , ticket office and equipment hire facilities under the same roof - before they negotiate the slopes .
due to be completed in 2004 , the centre will cover 1,200sqm and also cater for summer sports .
it will also introduce online equipment booking and road , snow and weather reports using wap mobile phone technology .
centre plans james mcintosh , director of the lecht ski company , said the increased threat of global warming would not affect the busy slopes .
he said : " of course we realise the climate is changing .
" but the last three winters have been some of the most successful seasons ever for the lecht , and in 2001 we had the best snow i 've ever seen here .
" since 2000 , we have also been much more than a winter operation , with innovative new fun activities .
" we hope the new , improved café facilities will put us on the itinerary of many more touring coaches , and also offer our summer visitors an even better experience . "
a view from beside the slopes mr mcintosh said summer visitors will be attracted by the prospect of quad bikes , fun karts , dévalkarts , summer tubing , kiddie karts and chairlift rides .
he said the centre 's design took advantage of the lie of the land , with the lowest floor below ground on one side , while opening out to the hillside and chairlift on the other .
the lecht boasts scotland 's largest artificial system for making snow , with six mobile cannons covering all nursery slopes and the lower parts of most main runs .

it claims he was decorated in the 1990s by cuba 's ministry of the interior for uncovering cia agents working against fidel castro .
mr sanchez has vehemently denied the allegations .
for 35 years , elizardo sanchez has been a public critic of fidel castro 's government .
this book , written by two cuban government journalists , alleges he has been leading a double life and that five years ago he was recruited by the cuban authorities as a spy .
mr sanchez , who spent eight and a half years in a cuban jail in the 1980s , has dismissed the claims as complete lies .
sowing suspicion he did have some difficulty explaining photographs in the book .
one shows him apparently being affectionately greeted by a three star interior ministry official .
another shows him in a park , allegedly meeting a state intelligence officer .
mr sanchez says he can not recall the details of the encounters , but that he has always been happy to meet anyone to improve the human rights situation in cuba .
whatever the basis of the allegations , they do confirm the cuban government 's determination to sow suspicion amongst its opponents .
during the trials last april of 75 dissidents , it emerged that cuban intelligence had successfully infiltrated many opposition groups .
the cuban authorities will no doubt be hoping that a dissident movement where no one can trust anyone becomes impotent .

the kandahar government spokesman , khaled pushtun , said some of afghanistan 's neighbours were supplying taleban insurgents with money to carry out attacks aimed at destabilising the region .
mr pushtun was speaking amidst calls for greater security measures in the border areas between the two countries following another attack on an afghan government post by suspected taleban .
he said that while afghanistan had good relations with the pakistani government , islamist political parties in pakistan had always openly supported the taleban , and they were continuing to provide funds and moral support now .
islamist parties are in power in both of the pakistani provinces which border afghanistan .
mr pushtun said that a minority of afghans in the south still favour the taleban and outsiders were taking advantage of this to promote anti-government activity on the afghan side of the border .
he said there should be more international pressure on afghanistan 's neighbours to prevent this .
president karzai 's decision to replace gul agha sherzai was significant the afghan president , hamid karzai , has recently appointed a new governor in kandahar , in what is being seen as an attempt to assert his authority in southern afghanistan .
the news has been broadly welcomed , although some tribal leaders are annoyed at the decision to remove gul agha sherzai as governor .
mr sherzai was a supporter of afghanistan 's former king zahir shah .
a political party has recently been formed to campaign for a constitutional monarchy in afghanistan and some tribal elders see mr sherzai 's removal as the beginning of a campaign to weaken the royalists ahead of next year 's planned elections .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- cheshire frets about ' affluenza ' home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : tuesday , 19 august , 2003 , 07:43 gmt 08:43 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version cheshire frets about ' affluenza ' by james arnold bbc news online business reporter are there clouds in happy valley 's blue sky ?
in the third part of a series on the north-south economic divide , bbc news online visits the extraordinary pocket of wealth in north-west cheshire , and finds that affluence brings its own worries .
they do n't call bollington " happy valley " for nothing .
for a start , according to the guinness book of records , the little cheshire town has the world 's highest ratios of pubs to people .
the conurbation of greater manchester may loom just 15 miles away , but no metropolitan soot besmirches bollington 's victorian stones .
and although the cotton mills that underpinned the town 's economy closed years ago , bollington is rolling in money .
cheshire cheer cheshire - or at least its northeast corner , around macclesfield , wilmslow and knutsford - is an extraordinary pocket of affluence by any measure .
compared with the rest of northwest england , it stands out like a sore thumb .
the average house price in macclesfield borough is £ 200,000 , compared with £ 96,000 for the north-west as a whole .
macclesfield 's gross domestic product per head is 114 % of the national average , as against 87 % for the north-west .
and unemployment in northeast cheshire is just 1.1 % , one-fifth of the national average .
when high incomes are set against the relatively low cost of cheshire living , the distinction becomes even more acute .
according to a recent survey from barclays private clients , tatton - the parliamentary constituency that encompasses much of macclesfield borough - has the highest disposable income in the country , and three other cheshire districts were in the national top 10 .
balls and malls much of this glamour is concentrated in wilmslow , now more or less a dormitory town for manchester united football club .
this is a very smart town with very smart people ... we do n't see beggars in the street peter harrington " sit in any of the cafes on this street at night , and you 'll see bentleys , rollers , aston martins , ferraris - more than you 'd see in a couple of years in manchester , " says john duckworth of wilmslow car dealership stratstone 's , which alone accounts for 20 % of uk sales of £ 100,000-plus aston martins .
peter harrington , whose town-centre jewellers sells £ 25,000 watches to footballers and silver salvers to the gentry , can barely contain his glee .
" this is a very smart town with very smart people - discerning people who love to shop .
" cheshire is now sucking the money out of -lsb- the lancashire towns of -rsb- rochdale , oldham , ashton-under-lyne , blackpool , because they do n't have the infrastructure any more .
" we are quite cushioned ; we do n't see beggars in the street . "
in comes the money ...
nor is there any sign of the boom levelling off .
at an annual 51 % , house-price growth macclesfield borough is the fastest in the country .
footballers ' mansions aside , town houses in pretty knutsford now regularly fetch £ 1m-plus , and a basic semi can be £ 200,000 - almost 10 times the price in some places north of manchester .
" i really ca n't see how things can slow down , at least in the short term , " says rodney jennings of meller braggins estate agents .
according to peter yates , chief planning officer of macclesfield council , his borough receives more planning applications than any other in the northwest , and has already filled its quota of new developments until 2011 .
" wilmslow nearly died 10 years ago , " says paul waddell of wilmslow interiors .
" there used to be a lot of empty premises ; now , it 's impossible to find any .
it 's a very busy little town . " ... out goes the charm ?
not everyone is cheering .
rapid development has , some say , torn the soul out of cheshire .
wilmslow , and scarcely a footballer 's wife in sight " when i moved here 25 years ago , wilmslow was very charming , " says susy krakowski , a local hat designers .
" it 's very lacking in charm now .
" you never meet people who have been born here ; it 's always the place that you move to when you 've made some money in the city .
" and that has gone pretty rampant recently . "
wilmslow 's mushrooming pubs and bars , locals say , attract a rowdy element to the town after dark ; the police have responded with a series of sweeping nighttime raids .
social dysfunction in bollington , a tightly-knit - and until recently , fairly insular - little town , the erosion of community has been felt most acutely .
local people here are being squeezed ...
it sounds odd to say it , but we are a deprived area john kershaw the town has seen an extraordinary influx of new blood - pilots based at nearby manchester airport , scientists working at astrazeneca , whose headquarters are near macclesfield , doctors from the manchester hospitals .
and while this has brought in money and jobs , says john kershaw , bollington 's mayor , it has disrupted the usual calm rhythms of the place .
st john the baptist church , a victorian gem in the centre of town , closed its doors in june after running out of money for repairs .
" we have a prize-winning brass band , but it has nowhere to practise ; we have a fantastic cricket club , but the pavilion is an absolute disgrace , " says mr kershaw .
" there 's plenty of money here , but it 's a question of squeezing it out of people . "
' we are deprived ' worse , high property prices are starting to have the same sort of effect as in the more famously well-off south-east .
a typical day in cheshire 's wealth belt few people who work in wilmslow can afford to live there : only one member of the town 's fire brigade lives locally , for example , and many people commute from the other side of manchester .
" local people here are being squeezed and squeezed and squeezed , " says mr kershaw in bollington .
" if you 're faced with minimum house prices of £ 190,000 , you need two damn good incomes to service a mortgage .
" it does n't leave you a lot of disposable income .
it sounds odd to say it , but we are a deprived area . "
the council understands the crippling shortage of affordable housing , says planning chief peter yates , but is hampered by regulations .
unlike the south-east , where some greenfield sites have recently been earmarked for huge swathes of housing , there is still a blanket ban on most kinds of new development in the north .
do n't worry , be happy there are , it seems , currents of resentment beneath cheshire 's placid surface .
long-time residents dislike the brashness of the new money , and the noise , traffic and builders ' dust it brings with it ; newcomers , for their part , see many locals as unthinkingly conservative , determined to cling to an outmoded vision of rural seclusion .
nearly everyone is worried that cheshire might start to suffer the sort of " affluenza " they perceive in london and the south-east - gridlocked roads , collapsing public services , unsustainable levels of immigration and so on .
but to be realistic , such fears are still remote .
cheshire 's residents may be experts at saloon-bar whingeing , but deep down , they are a contented lot .
in a recent survey for cheshire county council , 92 % of people said they liked living in the area , rising to 98 % in macclesfield borough - a figure scarcely imaginable in the home counties .

in the third part of a series on the north-south economic divide , bbc news online visits the extraordinary pocket of wealth in north-west cheshire , and finds that affluence brings its own worries .
they do n't call bollington " happy valley " for nothing .
for a start , according to the guinness book of records , the little cheshire town has the world 's highest ratios of pubs to people .
the conurbation of greater manchester may loom just 15 miles away , but no metropolitan soot besmirches bollington 's victorian stones .
and although the cotton mills that underpinned the town 's economy closed years ago , bollington is rolling in money .
cheshire cheer cheshire - or at least its northeast corner , around macclesfield , wilmslow and knutsford - is an extraordinary pocket of affluence by any measure .
compared with the rest of northwest england , it stands out like a sore thumb .
the average house price in macclesfield borough is £ 200,000 , compared with £ 96,000 for the north-west as a whole .
macclesfield 's gross domestic product per head is 114 % of the national average , as against 87 % for the north-west .
and unemployment in northeast cheshire is just 1.1 % , one-fifth of the national average .
when high incomes are set against the relatively low cost of cheshire living , the distinction becomes even more acute .
according to a recent survey from barclays private clients , tatton - the parliamentary constituency that encompasses much of macclesfield borough - has the highest disposable income in the country , and three other cheshire districts were in the national top 10 .
balls and malls much of this glamour is concentrated in wilmslow , now more or less a dormitory town for manchester united football club .
this is a very smart town with very smart people ... we do n't see beggars in the street peter harrington " sit in any of the cafes on this street at night , and you 'll see bentleys , rollers , aston martins , ferraris - more than you 'd see in a couple of years in manchester , " says john duckworth of wilmslow car dealership stratstone 's , which alone accounts for 20 % of uk sales of £ 100,000-plus aston martins .
peter harrington , whose town-centre jewellers sells £ 25,000 watches to footballers and silver salvers to the gentry , can barely contain his glee .
" this is a very smart town with very smart people - discerning people who love to shop .
" cheshire is now sucking the money out of -lsb- the lancashire towns of -rsb- rochdale , oldham , ashton-under-lyne , blackpool , because they do n't have the infrastructure any more .
" we are quite cushioned ; we do n't see beggars in the street . "
in comes the money ...
nor is there any sign of the boom levelling off .
at an annual 51 % , house-price growth macclesfield borough is the fastest in the country .
footballers ' mansions aside , town houses in pretty knutsford now regularly fetch £ 1m-plus , and a basic semi can be £ 200,000 - almost 10 times the price in some places north of manchester .
" i really ca n't see how things can slow down , at least in the short term , " says rodney jennings of meller braggins estate agents .
according to peter yates , chief planning officer of macclesfield council , his borough receives more planning applications than any other in the northwest , and has already filled its quota of new developments until 2011 .
" wilmslow nearly died 10 years ago , " says paul waddell of wilmslow interiors .
" there used to be a lot of empty premises ; now , it 's impossible to find any .
it 's a very busy little town . " ... out goes the charm ?
not everyone is cheering .
rapid development has , some say , torn the soul out of cheshire .
wilmslow , and scarcely a footballer 's wife in sight " when i moved here 25 years ago , wilmslow was very charming , " says susy krakowski , a local hat designers .
" it 's very lacking in charm now .
" you never meet people who have been born here ; it 's always the place that you move to when you 've made some money in the city .
" and that has gone pretty rampant recently . "
wilmslow 's mushrooming pubs and bars , locals say , attract a rowdy element to the town after dark ; the police have responded with a series of sweeping nighttime raids .
social dysfunction in bollington , a tightly-knit - and until recently , fairly insular - little town , the erosion of community has been felt most acutely .
local people here are being squeezed ...
it sounds odd to say it , but we are a deprived area john kershaw the town has seen an extraordinary influx of new blood - pilots based at nearby manchester airport , scientists working at astrazeneca , whose headquarters are near macclesfield , doctors from the manchester hospitals .
and while this has brought in money and jobs , says john kershaw , bollington 's mayor , it has disrupted the usual calm rhythms of the place .
st john the baptist church , a victorian gem in the centre of town , closed its doors in june after running out of money for repairs .
" we have a prize-winning brass band , but it has nowhere to practise ; we have a fantastic cricket club , but the pavilion is an absolute disgrace , " says mr kershaw .
" there 's plenty of money here , but it 's a question of squeezing it out of people . "
' we are deprived ' worse , high property prices are starting to have the same sort of effect as in the more famously well-off south-east .
a typical day in cheshire 's wealth belt few people who work in wilmslow can afford to live there : only one member of the town 's fire brigade lives locally , for example , and many people commute from the other side of manchester .
" local people here are being squeezed and squeezed and squeezed , " says mr kershaw in bollington .
" if you 're faced with minimum house prices of £ 190,000 , you need two damn good incomes to service a mortgage .
" it does n't leave you a lot of disposable income .
it sounds odd to say it , but we are a deprived area . "
the council understands the crippling shortage of affordable housing , says planning chief peter yates , but is hampered by regulations .
unlike the south-east , where some greenfield sites have recently been earmarked for huge swathes of housing , there is still a blanket ban on most kinds of new development in the north .
do n't worry , be happy there are , it seems , currents of resentment beneath cheshire 's placid surface .
long-time residents dislike the brashness of the new money , and the noise , traffic and builders ' dust it brings with it ; newcomers , for their part , see many locals as unthinkingly conservative , determined to cling to an outmoded vision of rural seclusion .
nearly everyone is worried that cheshire might start to suffer the sort of " affluenza " they perceive in london and the south-east - gridlocked roads , collapsing public services , unsustainable levels of immigration and so on .
but to be realistic , such fears are still remote .
cheshire 's residents may be experts at saloon-bar whingeing , but deep down , they are a contented lot .
in a recent survey for cheshire county council , 92 % of people said they liked living in the area , rising to 98 % in macclesfield borough - a figure scarcely imaginable in the home counties .
there may be moans , but it seems that happy valley is still smiling .

the ilkeston taxi association which is made up of four local firms is bringing the action which will mean passengers who are violent towards drivers will not be picked up again .
erewash borough council has not endorsed the new policy because it contravenes an 1847 law which states that hackney cab drivers have to pick up fares .
drivers say the action is necessary to protect taxi drivers .
john richardson , head of the ilkeston taxi association said : " the ban is necessary because over the last three years we have had no less than five assaults in the ilkeston area .
" not only with my own firm but with the other neighbouring firms as well .
" we 've now got together to blanket ban anyone , so the message is leave taxi drivers alone . "

australian firm roc oil was granted permission last year to explore for oil and gas in a field near hadrian 's wall .
the site of exploratory work and drilling is just outside of the boundary of the hadrian 's wall world heritage site , north of hexham in northumberland .
now roc oil says it wants to close a road - the c223 - so it can begin constructing an entrance to the field , before it begins drilling .
people who live near the site are opposed the idea , saying it would be detrimental to hadrian 's wall and cause traffic problems .
' tremendous ' noise resident ian crawford , who has objected to the proposal , said : " it is in the wrong site .
if it was moved 50 yards west , i think a lot of the local concerns would be addressed .
" it is primarily the noise and the traffic that are the two main points .
" for example , all the water has to be brought in by tanker , and by definition , has to be taken away by tankers .
" if they moved the site to the other side of the a68 , the fully-laden tankers and lorries would turn left off the road .
" secondly , the actual contours of the area would mean we would get a tremendous amount of battering from the noise .
it was estimated it would be over 100 decibels at the point of drilling . "
strict conditions the company was given permission to erect a drilling tower , over 100 ft high , just a few miles from hadrian 's wall , for their exploratory work .
gordon halliday , assistant environment manager for northumberland county council , said a lot of conditions had been imposed .
he said : " at this stage all the company is proposing is an exploration stage .
it is a fairly limited operation .
" this rig is not allowed to be site in a vertical position for more than 10 weeks .
" we fully consulted with english heritage who had no objections in relation to the effect on hadrian 's wall .
" it is a very beautiful , sensitive area , but given the strong government presumption in favour of this development , we did not feel it was possible to object on landscape grounds .
" we have imposed very strict conditions in terms of noise , road modifications and we 've imposed conditions to ensure road safety . "
