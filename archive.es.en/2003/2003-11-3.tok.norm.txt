program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.11.2003 a british model for germany 's pension reforms ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are they doing things better across the channel ?
governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .
in germany , however , people have become accustomed to leaving things in the hands of the government , and it could prove very difficult to change this way of thinking - unless would-be reformers can point to significant advantages . peter wozny send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .
in germany , however , people have become accustomed to leaving things in the hands of the government , and it could prove very difficult to change this way of thinking - unless would-be reformers can point to significant advantages . peter wozny send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .

indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .
each of the students receives 20 chiemgauer a month for their efforts in keeping the new currency afloat . mariana schröder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ initiative hopes to capitalize on germany ’ s rapid and overwhelming embrace of online culture and widen the use of the technology in business and education . although germany is one of the fastest growing countries for internet usage in europe , the german government believes the number of users outweighs the number of companies providing services online .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .
in germany , however , people have become accustomed to leaving things in the hands of the government , and it could prove very difficult to change this way of thinking - unless would-be reformers can point to significant advantages . peter wozny send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .
in germany , however , people have become accustomed to leaving things in the hands of the government , and it could prove very difficult to change this way of thinking - unless would-be reformers can point to significant advantages . peter wozny send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .
each of the students receives 20 chiemgauer a month for their efforts in keeping the new currency afloat . mariana schröder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ initiative hopes to capitalize on germany ’ s rapid and overwhelming embrace of online culture and widen the use of the technology in business and education . although germany is one of the fastest growing countries for internet usage in europe , the german government believes the number of users outweighs the number of companies providing services online .
but the ratio needs balancing if the internet is to be of any use to germany ’ s ailing economy . more than half of the german population is already online , providing those companies which offer services over the internet with an ever-expanding potential customer base . missed opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is your business connected ?
however , not even half of all small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in germany make use of the internet and less than one-tenth have any web presence .
thus , many companies fail to reach their full customer base and market strength .
figures show that more and more germans are using their internet connection to gain access to products they need and want . in the first half year of this year , german households bought goods online for a value of € 2.4 billion -lrb- $ 2.75 billion -rrb- and the forecast for 2003 as a whole is € 5.3 billion , according to market research institute gfk .
this forecast would mean an increase by € 600 million compared with 2002 . online hope for economy still , it 's not enough for the german government .
it is convinced that getting more companies to offer their goods online would open up even more opportunities , increase the amount spent online and help businesses sell more .
the hope is that the economy would begin to profit from these online exchanges and that internet trading would help towards recovery and growth . “ we want internet usage to increase to around 75 percent .
it currently lies above 50 percent , ” said martin cronenberg from the federal employment ministry .
“ we have around 10 percent of smes using the internet .
we want this percentage to climb to 40 percent by 2008 . ” increasing skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more children will learn necessary skills .
the increase in online trading is only one target of the government initiative .
in a bid to expand the job opportunities of high school graduates and the unemployed , the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ project will work towards providing increased access to the internet and more training in computer skills , both at school level and in re-training . despite the on-going success of the ‘ schools online ’ project , which aims to provide internet connections for all german school children , almost two-thirds of pupils have never taken a computer course to learn the skills that most jobs require and only around 29 percent use a computer in their lessons . job search online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online hope for those without jobs .

memberships are up , larger operators continue to expand and bigger centers are on the way .
the prospect of further growth seems unfathomable but by no means impossible . gone are the days when german gyms were filled with arnold schwarzenegger wannabes , pumping aging iron on machines that looked like medieval torture devices in a concerted effort to emulate the austrian bodybuilding icon .
back then ; these pungent temples to physique were mainly the domain of dedicated , mostly male , weightlifters , straining muscle and sinew in minimalist and dingy surroundings .
how times have changed … fitness as a lifestyle choice and , more importantly , a growth industry has changed the demographic of german gym goers .
state-of-the-art cardiovascular and resistance equipment , luxurious surroundings , mtv and wellness annexes bulging with saunas and pools have tempted a new type of client to the clubs .
and the popularity of the lifestyle and promise of “ a new you ” has paid huge dividends to the german fitness market , making it the second largest in europe . growth in the german fitness market has been steadily increasing over the past decade .
according to a 2002 report by business consultancy deloitte and touche , nationwide membership figures for the german fitness sector increased by 155 percent in the ten year period beginning 1992 , averaging around 11 percent growth every year .
that meant that by the end of 2002 , around 5 million germans , almost 6.2 percent of the population , were members of a fitness club . karsten hollasch , the head of the health and fitness competence center at deloitte and touche , spoke to deutsche welle about the reasons for the growing popularity . media presentation of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " public awareness of fitness and wellness has increased through the promotion of the lifestyle , especially in the media , " he said .
" also , it 's a totally different concept to the hardcore bodybuilding of the 80 's .
that had a very small audience .
now it 's slow and easy and it attracts more people . " " the offer concept in germany has also helped .
specializing offers , for example , for women , for those with certain health problems and those into the wellness concept , has created demand over the past five to six years . " of course , while members are working up a sweat , they ’ re also working up a profit for the major centers .
membership fees and other sales generate around € 3.3 billion a year for the fitness segment in germany .
average monthly fees range from € 20 for standard membership in a smaller studio to € 100 + for top range gold card holders . number of clubs reached plateau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the cult of the body continues to persuade many people that buff is beautiful , the fitness boom of the nineties seems to have reached a plateau in terms of the number of clubs .
once the trend really kicked in , the number of clubs in germany surged from 4,750 in 1992 to 6,500 in 1999 but hovered around that number for the following three years .
it seemed that the market was being saturated and that the industry had exhausted its raw material - those wanting to pay to exercise . in reality , what was happening - and what is still the case in the german market today - was the rise to dominance of four major players .
together , the fitness company , elixia , fsh future sports and tc holdings continue to grow faster than the overall market that supports them , with a combined membership of around 75 percent of the entire national total . big clubs favor expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with these four operators increasing their numbers of sophisticated establishments , offering everything from calorie burning aerobics classes and indoor cycling to shiatsu and aromatherapy , the expanding market in what are essentially fitness malls has led to the slow demise of smaller centers . both the fitness company and elixia have a policy of year-on-year expansion ; the fitness company aiming for 15 new clubs a year , elixia opening three every 12 months .
with the finances generated from membership fees capable of funding such expansion plans , smaller competitors often face the only solution open to them and that is to close down . this hasn ’ t stopped new businesses entering the market .
in july , karstadt warenhaus ag , the leading sports supplies arm of the department store chain karstadtquelle , announced that it was moving into the gym owning business by buying nine clubs from the 24 hour fitness chain and re-branding them under the karstadt name .
with one acquisition , karstadt inherited 28,000 members and a captive audience for its range of sports products .
sources at the company announced at the time that this was just the start of “ a rapid expansion with fitness clubs in the coming years . ” smaller operators dropping away despite the odd would-be usurper , the demand for fitness and wellness centers in germany is likely to keep the larger operators going for some time , despite figures that show the number of studios has reduced by around 1000 in 2003 .
however , this is more likely to be a result of failing businesses . forecasts for 2005 by deloitte and touche show that the larger fitness companies will increase their share as smaller competitors drop away over the next two years .
but there may be an even bigger kid on the block preparing to make its presence felt . country clubs in the ascendence the forecasts predict the emergence of the ‘ super ’ centers , based on the sprawling country club format which has proved popular for the upper-middle to upper class leisure enthusiasts in the u.s. and u.k. these expansive estates usually spread over a 2000sq meter area and contain large pools , tennis courts and sometimes even golf courses .
in the study , the german health & fitness market in the year 2005 , the consultancy predicts that the market share of premium wellness centers and country clubs will increase from 3 percent in 2001 to 9 percent by 2005 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de golf in germany means much more than vw as the german open golf championship continues in glorious cologne sunshine , the inquisitive observer may look on with bemusement .

the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ initiative hopes to capitalize on germany ’ s rapid and overwhelming embrace of online culture and widen the use of the technology in business and education . although germany is one of the fastest growing countries for internet usage in europe , the german government believes the number of users outweighs the number of companies providing services online .
but the ratio needs balancing if the internet is to be of any use to germany ’ s ailing economy . more than half of the german population is already online , providing those companies which offer services over the internet with an ever-expanding potential customer base . missed opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is your business connected ?
however , not even half of all small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in germany make use of the internet and less than one-tenth have any web presence .
thus , many companies fail to reach their full customer base and market strength .
figures show that more and more germans are using their internet connection to gain access to products they need and want . in the first half year of this year , german households bought goods online for a value of € 2.4 billion -lrb- $ 2.75 billion -rrb- and the forecast for 2003 as a whole is € 5.3 billion , according to market research institute gfk .
this forecast would mean an increase by € 600 million compared with 2002 . online hope for economy still , it 's not enough for the german government .
it is convinced that getting more companies to offer their goods online would open up even more opportunities , increase the amount spent online and help businesses sell more .
the hope is that the economy would begin to profit from these online exchanges and that internet trading would help towards recovery and growth . “ we want internet usage to increase to around 75 percent .
it currently lies above 50 percent , ” said martin cronenberg from the federal employment ministry .
“ we have around 10 percent of smes using the internet .
we want this percentage to climb to 40 percent by 2008 . ” increasing skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more children will learn necessary skills .
the increase in online trading is only one target of the government initiative .
in a bid to expand the job opportunities of high school graduates and the unemployed , the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ project will work towards providing increased access to the internet and more training in computer skills , both at school level and in re-training . despite the on-going success of the ‘ schools online ’ project , which aims to provide internet connections for all german school children , almost two-thirds of pupils have never taken a computer course to learn the skills that most jobs require and only around 29 percent use a computer in their lessons . job search online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online hope for those without jobs .
for the unemployed , besides increased training in computer skills , the plan includes the launch of the government ’ s ' virtual job market ’ in december , which german chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ europe ’ s largest job and training exchange . ”
studies show that 80 percent of online users have used the internet to look for jobs and almost 20 percent of them have been successful . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de majority of germans online most germans are hooked up to the internet , a joint study by german public broadcasters ard and zdf found .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .
in germany , however , people have become accustomed to leaving things in the hands of the government , and it could prove very difficult to change this way of thinking - unless would-be reformers can point to significant advantages . peter wozny send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .
each of the students receives 20 chiemgauer a month for their efforts in keeping the new currency afloat . mariana schröder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .
each of the students receives 20 chiemgauer a month for their efforts in keeping the new currency afloat . mariana schröder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ initiative hopes to capitalize on germany ’ s rapid and overwhelming embrace of online culture and widen the use of the technology in business and education . although germany is one of the fastest growing countries for internet usage in europe , the german government believes the number of users outweighs the number of companies providing services online .

the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ initiative hopes to capitalize on germany ’ s rapid and overwhelming embrace of online culture and widen the use of the technology in business and education . although germany is one of the fastest growing countries for internet usage in europe , the german government believes the number of users outweighs the number of companies providing services online .

memberships are up , larger operators continue to expand and bigger centers are on the way .
the prospect of further growth seems unfathomable but by no means impossible . gone are the days when german gyms were filled with arnold schwarzenegger wannabes , pumping aging iron on machines that looked like medieval torture devices in a concerted effort to emulate the austrian bodybuilding icon .
back then ; these pungent temples to physique were mainly the domain of dedicated , mostly male , weightlifters , straining muscle and sinew in minimalist and dingy surroundings .
how times have changed … fitness as a lifestyle choice and , more importantly , a growth industry has changed the demographic of german gym goers .
state-of-the-art cardiovascular and resistance equipment , luxurious surroundings , mtv and wellness annexes bulging with saunas and pools have tempted a new type of client to the clubs .
and the popularity of the lifestyle and promise of “ a new you ” has paid huge dividends to the german fitness market , making it the second largest in europe . growth in the german fitness market has been steadily increasing over the past decade .
according to a 2002 report by business consultancy deloitte and touche , nationwide membership figures for the german fitness sector increased by 155 percent in the ten year period beginning 1992 , averaging around 11 percent growth every year .
that meant that by the end of 2002 , around 5 million germans , almost 6.2 percent of the population , were members of a fitness club . karsten hollasch , the head of the health and fitness competence center at deloitte and touche , spoke to deutsche welle about the reasons for the growing popularity . media presentation of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " public awareness of fitness and wellness has increased through the promotion of the lifestyle , especially in the media , " he said .
" also , it 's a totally different concept to the hardcore bodybuilding of the 80 's .
that had a very small audience .
now it 's slow and easy and it attracts more people . " " the offer concept in germany has also helped .
specializing offers , for example , for women , for those with certain health problems and those into the wellness concept , has created demand over the past five to six years . " of course , while members are working up a sweat , they ’ re also working up a profit for the major centers .
membership fees and other sales generate around € 3.3 billion a year for the fitness segment in germany .
average monthly fees range from € 20 for standard membership in a smaller studio to € 100 + for top range gold card holders . number of clubs reached plateau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the cult of the body continues to persuade many people that buff is beautiful , the fitness boom of the nineties seems to have reached a plateau in terms of the number of clubs .
once the trend really kicked in , the number of clubs in germany surged from 4,750 in 1992 to 6,500 in 1999 but hovered around that number for the following three years .
it seemed that the market was being saturated and that the industry had exhausted its raw material - those wanting to pay to exercise . in reality , what was happening - and what is still the case in the german market today - was the rise to dominance of four major players .
together , the fitness company , elixia , fsh future sports and tc holdings continue to grow faster than the overall market that supports them , with a combined membership of around 75 percent of the entire national total . big clubs favor expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with these four operators increasing their numbers of sophisticated establishments , offering everything from calorie burning aerobics classes and indoor cycling to shiatsu and aromatherapy , the expanding market in what are essentially fitness malls has led to the slow demise of smaller centers . both the fitness company and elixia have a policy of year-on-year expansion ; the fitness company aiming for 15 new clubs a year , elixia opening three every 12 months .
with the finances generated from membership fees capable of funding such expansion plans , smaller competitors often face the only solution open to them and that is to close down . this hasn ’ t stopped new businesses entering the market .
in july , karstadt warenhaus ag , the leading sports supplies arm of the department store chain karstadtquelle , announced that it was moving into the gym owning business by buying nine clubs from the 24 hour fitness chain and re-branding them under the karstadt name .
with one acquisition , karstadt inherited 28,000 members and a captive audience for its range of sports products .
sources at the company announced at the time that this was just the start of “ a rapid expansion with fitness clubs in the coming years . ” smaller operators dropping away despite the odd would-be usurper , the demand for fitness and wellness centers in germany is likely to keep the larger operators going for some time , despite figures that show the number of studios has reduced by around 1000 in 2003 .
however , this is more likely to be a result of failing businesses . forecasts for 2005 by deloitte and touche show that the larger fitness companies will increase their share as smaller competitors drop away over the next two years .
but there may be an even bigger kid on the block preparing to make its presence felt . country clubs in the ascendence the forecasts predict the emergence of the ‘ super ’ centers , based on the sprawling country club format which has proved popular for the upper-middle to upper class leisure enthusiasts in the u.s. and u.k. these expansive estates usually spread over a 2000sq meter area and contain large pools , tennis courts and sometimes even golf courses .
in the study , the german health & fitness market in the year 2005 , the consultancy predicts that the market share of premium wellness centers and country clubs will increase from 3 percent in 2001 to 9 percent by 2005 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de golf in germany means much more than vw as the german open golf championship continues in glorious cologne sunshine , the inquisitive observer may look on with bemusement .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .
in germany , however , people have become accustomed to leaving things in the hands of the government , and it could prove very difficult to change this way of thinking - unless would-be reformers can point to significant advantages . peter wozny send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

how times have changed … fitness as a lifestyle choice and , more importantly , a growth industry has changed the demographic of german gym goers .
state-of-the-art cardiovascular and resistance equipment , luxurious surroundings , mtv and wellness annexes bulging with saunas and pools have tempted a new type of client to the clubs .
and the popularity of the lifestyle and promise of “ a new you ” has paid huge dividends to the german fitness market , making it the second largest in europe . growth in the german fitness market has been steadily increasing over the past decade .
according to a 2002 report by business consultancy deloitte and touche , nationwide membership figures for the german fitness sector increased by 155 percent in the ten year period beginning 1992 , averaging around 11 percent growth every year .
that meant that by the end of 2002 , around 5 million germans , almost 6.2 percent of the population , were members of a fitness club . karsten hollasch , the head of the health and fitness competence center at deloitte and touche , spoke to deutsche welle about the reasons for the growing popularity . media presentation of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " public awareness of fitness and wellness has increased through the promotion of the lifestyle , especially in the media , " he said .
" also , it 's a totally different concept to the hardcore bodybuilding of the 80 's .
that had a very small audience .
now it 's slow and easy and it attracts more people . " " the offer concept in germany has also helped .
specializing offers , for example , for women , for those with certain health problems and those into the wellness concept , has created demand over the past five to six years . " of course , while members are working up a sweat , they ’ re also working up a profit for the major centers .
membership fees and other sales generate around € 3.3 billion a year for the fitness segment in germany .
average monthly fees range from € 20 for standard membership in a smaller studio to € 100 + for top range gold card holders . number of clubs reached plateau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the cult of the body continues to persuade many people that buff is beautiful , the fitness boom of the nineties seems to have reached a plateau in terms of the number of clubs .
once the trend really kicked in , the number of clubs in germany surged from 4,750 in 1992 to 6,500 in 1999 but hovered around that number for the following three years .
it seemed that the market was being saturated and that the industry had exhausted its raw material - those wanting to pay to exercise . in reality , what was happening - and what is still the case in the german market today - was the rise to dominance of four major players .
together , the fitness company , elixia , fsh future sports and tc holdings continue to grow faster than the overall market that supports them , with a combined membership of around 75 percent of the entire national total . big clubs favor expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with these four operators increasing their numbers of sophisticated establishments , offering everything from calorie burning aerobics classes and indoor cycling to shiatsu and aromatherapy , the expanding market in what are essentially fitness malls has led to the slow demise of smaller centers . both the fitness company and elixia have a policy of year-on-year expansion ; the fitness company aiming for 15 new clubs a year , elixia opening three every 12 months .
with the finances generated from membership fees capable of funding such expansion plans , smaller competitors often face the only solution open to them and that is to close down . this hasn ’ t stopped new businesses entering the market .
in july , karstadt warenhaus ag , the leading sports supplies arm of the department store chain karstadtquelle , announced that it was moving into the gym owning business by buying nine clubs from the 24 hour fitness chain and re-branding them under the karstadt name .
with one acquisition , karstadt inherited 28,000 members and a captive audience for its range of sports products .
sources at the company announced at the time that this was just the start of “ a rapid expansion with fitness clubs in the coming years . ” smaller operators dropping away despite the odd would-be usurper , the demand for fitness and wellness centers in germany is likely to keep the larger operators going for some time , despite figures that show the number of studios has reduced by around 1000 in 2003 .
however , this is more likely to be a result of failing businesses . forecasts for 2005 by deloitte and touche show that the larger fitness companies will increase their share as smaller competitors drop away over the next two years .
but there may be an even bigger kid on the block preparing to make its presence felt . country clubs in the ascendence the forecasts predict the emergence of the ‘ super ’ centers , based on the sprawling country club format which has proved popular for the upper-middle to upper class leisure enthusiasts in the u.s. and u.k. these expansive estates usually spread over a 2000sq meter area and contain large pools , tennis courts and sometimes even golf courses .
in the study , the german health & fitness market in the year 2005 , the consultancy predicts that the market share of premium wellness centers and country clubs will increase from 3 percent in 2001 to 9 percent by 2005 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de golf in germany means much more than vw as the german open golf championship continues in glorious cologne sunshine , the inquisitive observer may look on with bemusement .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .
in germany , however , people have become accustomed to leaving things in the hands of the government , and it could prove very difficult to change this way of thinking - unless would-be reformers can point to significant advantages . peter wozny send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 03.11.2003 giving the euro the cold shoulder großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no euros needed !
the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .
each of the students receives 20 chiemgauer a month for their efforts in keeping the new currency afloat . mariana schröder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .
their european neighbors on the other hand have developed a better relationship with the new money .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .
in germany , however , people have become accustomed to leaving things in the hands of the government , and it could prove very difficult to change this way of thinking - unless would-be reformers can point to significant advantages . peter wozny send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

memberships are up , larger operators continue to expand and bigger centers are on the way .
the prospect of further growth seems unfathomable but by no means impossible . gone are the days when german gyms were filled with arnold schwarzenegger wannabes , pumping aging iron on machines that looked like medieval torture devices in a concerted effort to emulate the austrian bodybuilding icon .
back then ; these pungent temples to physique were mainly the domain of dedicated , mostly male , weightlifters , straining muscle and sinew in minimalist and dingy surroundings .
how times have changed … fitness as a lifestyle choice and , more importantly , a growth industry has changed the demographic of german gym goers .
state-of-the-art cardiovascular and resistance equipment , luxurious surroundings , mtv and wellness annexes bulging with saunas and pools have tempted a new type of client to the clubs .
and the popularity of the lifestyle and promise of “ a new you ” has paid huge dividends to the german fitness market , making it the second largest in europe . growth in the german fitness market has been steadily increasing over the past decade .
according to a 2002 report by business consultancy deloitte and touche , nationwide membership figures for the german fitness sector increased by 155 percent in the ten year period beginning 1992 , averaging around 11 percent growth every year .
that meant that by the end of 2002 , around 5 million germans , almost 6.2 percent of the population , were members of a fitness club . karsten hollasch , the head of the health and fitness competence center at deloitte and touche , spoke to deutsche welle about the reasons for the growing popularity . media presentation of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " public awareness of fitness and wellness has increased through the promotion of the lifestyle , especially in the media , " he said .
" also , it 's a totally different concept to the hardcore bodybuilding of the 80 's .
that had a very small audience .
now it 's slow and easy and it attracts more people . " " the offer concept in germany has also helped .
specializing offers , for example , for women , for those with certain health problems and those into the wellness concept , has created demand over the past five to six years . " of course , while members are working up a sweat , they ’ re also working up a profit for the major centers .
membership fees and other sales generate around € 3.3 billion a year for the fitness segment in germany .
average monthly fees range from € 20 for standard membership in a smaller studio to € 100 + for top range gold card holders . number of clubs reached plateau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the cult of the body continues to persuade many people that buff is beautiful , the fitness boom of the nineties seems to have reached a plateau in terms of the number of clubs .
once the trend really kicked in , the number of clubs in germany surged from 4,750 in 1992 to 6,500 in 1999 but hovered around that number for the following three years .
it seemed that the market was being saturated and that the industry had exhausted its raw material - those wanting to pay to exercise . in reality , what was happening - and what is still the case in the german market today - was the rise to dominance of four major players .
together , the fitness company , elixia , fsh future sports and tc holdings continue to grow faster than the overall market that supports them , with a combined membership of around 75 percent of the entire national total . big clubs favor expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with these four operators increasing their numbers of sophisticated establishments , offering everything from calorie burning aerobics classes and indoor cycling to shiatsu and aromatherapy , the expanding market in what are essentially fitness malls has led to the slow demise of smaller centers . both the fitness company and elixia have a policy of year-on-year expansion ; the fitness company aiming for 15 new clubs a year , elixia opening three every 12 months .
with the finances generated from membership fees capable of funding such expansion plans , smaller competitors often face the only solution open to them and that is to close down . this hasn ’ t stopped new businesses entering the market .
in july , karstadt warenhaus ag , the leading sports supplies arm of the department store chain karstadtquelle , announced that it was moving into the gym owning business by buying nine clubs from the 24 hour fitness chain and re-branding them under the karstadt name .
with one acquisition , karstadt inherited 28,000 members and a captive audience for its range of sports products .
sources at the company announced at the time that this was just the start of “ a rapid expansion with fitness clubs in the coming years . ” smaller operators dropping away despite the odd would-be usurper , the demand for fitness and wellness centers in germany is likely to keep the larger operators going for some time , despite figures that show the number of studios has reduced by around 1000 in 2003 .
however , this is more likely to be a result of failing businesses . forecasts for 2005 by deloitte and touche show that the larger fitness companies will increase their share as smaller competitors drop away over the next two years .
but there may be an even bigger kid on the block preparing to make its presence felt . country clubs in the ascendence the forecasts predict the emergence of the ‘ super ’ centers , based on the sprawling country club format which has proved popular for the upper-middle to upper class leisure enthusiasts in the u.s. and u.k. these expansive estates usually spread over a 2000sq meter area and contain large pools , tennis courts and sometimes even golf courses .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .
each of the students receives 20 chiemgauer a month for their efforts in keeping the new currency afloat . mariana schröder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .
each of the students receives 20 chiemgauer a month for their efforts in keeping the new currency afloat . mariana schröder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ initiative hopes to capitalize on germany ’ s rapid and overwhelming embrace of online culture and widen the use of the technology in business and education . although germany is one of the fastest growing countries for internet usage in europe , the german government believes the number of users outweighs the number of companies providing services online .
but the ratio needs balancing if the internet is to be of any use to germany ’ s ailing economy . more than half of the german population is already online , providing those companies which offer services over the internet with an ever-expanding potential customer base . missed opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is your business connected ?
however , not even half of all small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in germany make use of the internet and less than one-tenth have any web presence .
thus , many companies fail to reach their full customer base and market strength .
figures show that more and more germans are using their internet connection to gain access to products they need and want . in the first half year of this year , german households bought goods online for a value of € 2.4 billion -lrb- $ 2.75 billion -rrb- and the forecast for 2003 as a whole is € 5.3 billion , according to market research institute gfk .
this forecast would mean an increase by € 600 million compared with 2002 . online hope for economy still , it 's not enough for the german government .
it is convinced that getting more companies to offer their goods online would open up even more opportunities , increase the amount spent online and help businesses sell more .
the hope is that the economy would begin to profit from these online exchanges and that internet trading would help towards recovery and growth . “ we want internet usage to increase to around 75 percent .
it currently lies above 50 percent , ” said martin cronenberg from the federal employment ministry .
“ we have around 10 percent of smes using the internet .
we want this percentage to climb to 40 percent by 2008 . ” increasing skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more children will learn necessary skills .
the increase in online trading is only one target of the government initiative .
in a bid to expand the job opportunities of high school graduates and the unemployed , the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ project will work towards providing increased access to the internet and more training in computer skills , both at school level and in re-training . despite the on-going success of the ‘ schools online ’ project , which aims to provide internet connections for all german school children , almost two-thirds of pupils have never taken a computer course to learn the skills that most jobs require and only around 29 percent use a computer in their lessons . job search online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online hope for those without jobs .
for the unemployed , besides increased training in computer skills , the plan includes the launch of the government ’ s ' virtual job market ’ in december , which german chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ europe ’ s largest job and training exchange . ”
studies show that 80 percent of online users have used the internet to look for jobs and almost 20 percent of them have been successful . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de majority of germans online most germans are hooked up to the internet , a joint study by german public broadcasters ard and zdf found .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .
in germany , however , people have become accustomed to leaving things in the hands of the government , and it could prove very difficult to change this way of thinking - unless would-be reformers can point to significant advantages . peter wozny send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

in germany , however , people have become accustomed to leaving things in the hands of the government , and it could prove very difficult to change this way of thinking - unless would-be reformers can point to significant advantages . peter wozny send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .
each of the students receives 20 chiemgauer a month for their efforts in keeping the new currency afloat . mariana schröder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .
in germany , however , people have become accustomed to leaving things in the hands of the government , and it could prove very difficult to change this way of thinking - unless would-be reformers can point to significant advantages . peter wozny send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ initiative hopes to capitalize on germany ’ s rapid and overwhelming embrace of online culture and widen the use of the technology in business and education . although germany is one of the fastest growing countries for internet usage in europe , the german government believes the number of users outweighs the number of companies providing services online .
but the ratio needs balancing if the internet is to be of any use to germany ’ s ailing economy . more than half of the german population is already online , providing those companies which offer services over the internet with an ever-expanding potential customer base . missed opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is your business connected ?
however , not even half of all small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in germany make use of the internet and less than one-tenth have any web presence .
thus , many companies fail to reach their full customer base and market strength .
figures show that more and more germans are using their internet connection to gain access to products they need and want . in the first half year of this year , german households bought goods online for a value of € 2.4 billion -lrb- $ 2.75 billion -rrb- and the forecast for 2003 as a whole is € 5.3 billion , according to market research institute gfk .
this forecast would mean an increase by € 600 million compared with 2002 . online hope for economy still , it 's not enough for the german government .
it is convinced that getting more companies to offer their goods online would open up even more opportunities , increase the amount spent online and help businesses sell more .
the hope is that the economy would begin to profit from these online exchanges and that internet trading would help towards recovery and growth . “ we want internet usage to increase to around 75 percent .
it currently lies above 50 percent , ” said martin cronenberg from the federal employment ministry .
“ we have around 10 percent of smes using the internet .
we want this percentage to climb to 40 percent by 2008 . ” increasing skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more children will learn necessary skills .
the increase in online trading is only one target of the government initiative .
in a bid to expand the job opportunities of high school graduates and the unemployed , the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ project will work towards providing increased access to the internet and more training in computer skills , both at school level and in re-training . despite the on-going success of the ‘ schools online ’ project , which aims to provide internet connections for all german school children , almost two-thirds of pupils have never taken a computer course to learn the skills that most jobs require and only around 29 percent use a computer in their lessons . job search online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online hope for those without jobs .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .
each of the students receives 20 chiemgauer a month for their efforts in keeping the new currency afloat . mariana schröder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

and the popularity of the lifestyle and promise of “ a new you ” has paid huge dividends to the german fitness market , making it the second largest in europe . growth in the german fitness market has been steadily increasing over the past decade .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .
each of the students receives 20 chiemgauer a month for their efforts in keeping the new currency afloat . mariana schröder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .

“ anyone proposing longer working days doesn ’ t know what he ’ s talking about , ” said jürgen peters , the head of the ig metall trade union , which represents workers in the car manufacturing and steel industries .
also opposed to the idea was michael sommer , who chairs the german trade union federation .
government officials , opposition and business leaders have suggested adding several hours to the now common 35 to 37-hour workweek to keep germany ’ s faltering economy competitive internationally .
not all companies support such a move .
some , such as car maker opel and telecommunications giant deutsche telekom , want to shorten the working week to 30 to 34 hours in order to avoid layoffs . more briefs 03.11.2003 -pipe- german stock exchange limits trading hours 31.10.2003 -pipe- german retail sales stagnate in september 31.10.2003 -pipe- deutsche bahn to cut 1,000 jobs at service centers 31.10.2003 -pipe- metro surprises with higher third-quarter earnings 30.10.2003 -pipe- deutsche makes unexpected third quarter gains 30.10.2003 -pipe- puma records another huge profit rise 30.10.2003 -pipe- german beer industry sees recovery 30.10.2003 -pipe- aero lloyd pilots try to rescue carrier radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.11.2003 germany puts the e in economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job hunters , shoppers and traders are set to benefit from germany 's online push the promotion of electronic trading , online education and internet employment projects will form the core of the german government ’ s latest initiative to boost the economy and stimulate growth . the german government plans to launch a web-centered action program in december to encourage germans to use the internet in an attempt to promote growth and employment .
the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ initiative hopes to capitalize on germany ’ s rapid and overwhelming embrace of online culture and widen the use of the technology in business and education . although germany is one of the fastest growing countries for internet usage in europe , the german government believes the number of users outweighs the number of companies providing services online .
but the ratio needs balancing if the internet is to be of any use to germany ’ s ailing economy . more than half of the german population is already online , providing those companies which offer services over the internet with an ever-expanding potential customer base . missed opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is your business connected ?
however , not even half of all small- to medium-sized enterprises -lrb- smes -rrb- in germany make use of the internet and less than one-tenth have any web presence .
thus , many companies fail to reach their full customer base and market strength .
figures show that more and more germans are using their internet connection to gain access to products they need and want . in the first half year of this year , german households bought goods online for a value of € 2.4 billion -lrb- $ 2.75 billion -rrb- and the forecast for 2003 as a whole is € 5.3 billion , according to market research institute gfk .
this forecast would mean an increase by € 600 million compared with 2002 . online hope for economy still , it 's not enough for the german government .
it is convinced that getting more companies to offer their goods online would open up even more opportunities , increase the amount spent online and help businesses sell more .
the hope is that the economy would begin to profit from these online exchanges and that internet trading would help towards recovery and growth . “ we want internet usage to increase to around 75 percent .
it currently lies above 50 percent , ” said martin cronenberg from the federal employment ministry .
“ we have around 10 percent of smes using the internet .
we want this percentage to climb to 40 percent by 2008 . ” increasing skills bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more children will learn necessary skills .
the increase in online trading is only one target of the government initiative .
in a bid to expand the job opportunities of high school graduates and the unemployed , the ‘ information society deutschland 2006 ’ project will work towards providing increased access to the internet and more training in computer skills , both at school level and in re-training . despite the on-going success of the ‘ schools online ’ project , which aims to provide internet connections for all german school children , almost two-thirds of pupils have never taken a computer course to learn the skills that most jobs require and only around 29 percent use a computer in their lessons . job search online bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online hope for those without jobs .
for the unemployed , besides increased training in computer skills , the plan includes the launch of the government ’ s ' virtual job market ’ in december , which german chancellor gerhard schröder has called “ europe ’ s largest job and training exchange . ”
studies show that 80 percent of online users have used the internet to look for jobs and almost 20 percent of them have been successful . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de majority of germans online most germans are hooked up to the internet , a joint study by german public broadcasters ard and zdf found .

beer spoke out against merz ’ plan at a meeting of party leaders and members in berlin on monday , saying his tax proposals were “ neither social nor fair . ”
beer ’ s comments are in direct opposition to comments made by green party finance expert , christine scheel , who over the weekend applauded merz ’ attempt to reform the tax structure .
merz has proposed a reduction in the system to just three tax categories of 12 , 24 and 36 percent of income with the highest tax bracket applying to income over € 40,000 -lrb- around $ 46,000 -rrb- a year . more briefs 03.11.2003 -pipe- minister in anti-semitic row sacked 31.10.2003 -pipe- berlin budget deemed unconstitutional 31.10.2003 -pipe- water pollution rates soar after floods 31.10.2003 -pipe- crashed alpha jet plane found 31.10.2003 -pipe- no plans to change german stem cell rules 30.10.2003 -pipe- judge refuses to free alleged 9/11 accomplice 30.10.2003 -pipe- opposition leader promotes own tax reforms 30.10.2003 -pipe- olympic bid racked by further sacking radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .
each of the students receives 20 chiemgauer a month for their efforts in keeping the new currency afloat . mariana schröder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 03.11.2003 a british model for germany 's pension reforms ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are they doing things better across the channel ?
governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .
in germany , however , people have become accustomed to leaving things in the hands of the government , and it could prove very difficult to change this way of thinking - unless would-be reformers can point to significant advantages . peter wozny send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de italy hit by pensions strike as germany debates reforms italy was brought to a standstill by a massive general strike protesting proposed pension reforms on friday , as germany ’ s parliament debated an equally contentious revamp of its own pensions system -lrb- oct .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .

governments throughout europe are struggling with pension reform .
in the search for solutions to the crisis , should the germans look to britain for answers ? how much should workers rely on private retirement provisions versus those provided by the state ?
or , put differently , how much of a worker 's retirement income should come from a national pension scheme as opposed to a privately held retirement or company-based policy ?
the governments of germany and britain - like in many other policy areas - have traditionally responded differently to these fundamental questions .
but with the german system facing potential collapse under the weight of demographic pressures and economic troubles , should government leaders look to the british model for solutions ? germany and britain , the key differences germany and britain have served as archetypes of the different pension systems in europe .
for more than a hundred years , the so-called " contract between the generations " has prevailed in germany : the pension benefits of the retiring generation are financed by the contributions of the current working generation .
just one retirement plan is legally mandated , and the benefits paid out to individual workers is related to the amount that a worker contributed over a lifetime . therefore , retirement benefits are meant to maintain the standard of living attained during a lifetime of unemployment .
if you earned more -lrb- and , therefore , contributed more -rrb- you 'll get more , and vice versa .
the system works as long as society 's demographics play along with it .
but when birth rates decline , people start living longer and unemployment figures rise , there are n't enough people paying into the system to counteract those taking out .
as a result , some people have suggested replacing the current german system with a " basic pension " -lrb- " basisrente " -rrb- , which would see all pensioners receive the same amount , regardless of previous income .
that would mean that in order to maintain their standard of living , millions of german 's would have to pay into private pension plans . though this idea might be anathema to many germans , it has long been the norm in great britain .
there , the " basic pension , " administrated and paid out by the government , provides for basic needs , but nothing more .
it by no means ensures that a worker will be able to maintain his or her previous standard of living .
that 's why , in 1978 , a legally required additional pension , came into being , the state earnings related pensions scheme -lrb- serps -rrb- . many who relied solely on the basic pension system - and did n't have personal or company plans - were falling through the cracks , and serps was meant to serve as a safety net , essentially making sure that every working person had some form of pension in addition to the basic state pension .
serps benefits are related to previous income : those who earn more pay higher contributions - but they also receive higher benefits .
what 's more , serps is also based on the pay-as-you go model , with current contributions covering current payments and the government makes up the difference . motivating people to make invest privately workers in britain can opt out of the legally required serps pension scheme if they make other comparable private arrangements or have a pension scheme through their employer -lrb- the majority opt out to take advantage of employer-offered schemes -rrb- .
if a british worker chooses to opt out of the serps program , then his or her social benefit contributions are reduced .
and because its in the interest of the state to encourage as many people as possible to take out private pension plans or go with one offered by an employer , the government offers tax incentives to those who do so . by pursuing this course of action , the british government hopes to encourage individuals to take on the responsibility of providing for their own retirement .
basically , the british government is looking to get out of the pension provision business .
the state-controlled pension system , which is funded by social benefit contributions , will eventually be unburdened by an alternative system of private and company benefit schemes , which are financed by accumulated capital .
and the government is well on its way to making this state of affairs a reality : 86 percent of men and 77 percent of women have opted out of the government run serps program and made alternative -lrb- private -rrb- arrangements . the private and company-based pension schemes are largely administrated by trustees , who invest the money in stocks and bonds .
so in addition to removing the burden of providing for retirement benefits from the state , this way of doing things also funnels large sums of money into the market .
that can certainly do wonders for a country 's economy . a new model for germany ? would such a system also work in germany ?
the answer is complicated .
with the downturn of international stock markets , many of the funds lost value .
many who had hoped to shore-up their state benefits with other arrangements - and thereby enjoy a comfortable retirement - saw their private pension funds drop by as much as 20 percent .
so , while this way of doing things might unburden the system and energize the stock market , it comes along with a certain amount of uncertainty , and has bred a bit of mistrust in the system . what 's more , the power of the trustees , who control millions in investment capital generated by the contributions , is thought by some critics to be too much . demographic pressures ultimately , the british pension system suffers from the same pressures as the german one : a demographic problem -lrb- an aging population and low birth rates -rrb- and a sluggish economy .
there are more people retiring than entering the work force , and the contributions of the working generation simply no longer covers the costs of financing the retiring generation . in order for a plan such as the british one to work , it would have to effectively counteract this problem .
but , the private and company-based funds , just like the statutory german fund , are also subject to these pressures .
so the british model , while having certain benefits over the german model , is not an end-all solution . what 's more , it might not be so easy for the german government to embrace privatisation and get out of the pension business , so to speak .
british citizens , through generations of experience , are more accustomed to taking on some of the responsibility and have gradually come to accept they 'll have to manage some of the risk on their own .

the people in the chiemgau region have an alternative to the common currency .
the euro may still be legal tender , but people in the southern german town of prien can also pay with a new regional currency invented by a group of local teenagers - the " chiemgauer . " after the introduction of the euro , many germans complained that the cost of living had gone up , because some sectors used the euro transition as an opportunity to raise prices .
indeed , real price hikes did take place in some food and service sectors , and the perception that the euro equaled less buying power has made germans reluctant to embrace their new currency .
since the switch to the euro , several communities in germany have debated creating their own regional currency , but only in the chiemgau region has the idea actually taken flight .
not anti-euro the " chiemgauer " is the project of a group of six teenage girls and their teacher at the private waldorf high school in prien .
they say it 's not meant as a protest against the euro , but rather as an incentive aimed at boosting local business .
but with more than 50,000 chiemgauers changing hands and circulation growing at 10 percent per month , their seven-month experiment looks like a success .
one of the first merchants in prien to start accepting the chiemgauer was julia kollmannsberger , owner of the prien regional market where local farmers sell their produce .
" the idea follows the same philosophy that we have here in our market , " kollmannsberger told deutsche welle .
" the regional currency has been introduced to keep the money here in the region .
our motto is that products that grow here should also be consumed here , so there was no doubt in our mind that we should participate . "
all for a good cause bundles of 50 chiemgauer , sorted according to their denominations of one , two , five , 10 and 20 , are available to the public at the waldorf school and several other locations in prien .
the exchange rate is one to one with the euro , so those who want to use the chiemgau pay € 50 for a bundle , to spend in around 80 local businesses .
participating businesses include cafes , food markets , and clothing stores .
students from the waldorf school pick up the chiemgauers at the end of every business day and give the merchant a receipt .
although one chiemgauer costs one euro , when the merchants turn them in , they get only 95 cents in return .
the remaining five cents is divided up between the students , who get two cents to cover the costs of printing and administrating the new currency , while three cents go into a local charity chosen by the merchant .
" it is certainly worth it because we know that the five percent benefits local institutions , " says kollmannsberger .
" we 're happy to contribute , and there 's also a certain advertising factor when you attract customers with the chiemgauer . "
monetary experiment christian gelleri , a 30-year old economics teacher at the waldorf school in prien came up with the idea for the chiemgau .
he was always fascinated by regional and complementary currencies , and had worked out a model for a regional currency which he wanted to experiment with first hand .
" i had the idea to try out the model here with students in the school and they wanted to transfer it into practice , " gelleri told deutsche welle .
" the euro is an important step for europe but it does n't meet the needs of all the different regions here in europe , so the idea was to create an additional instrument that fulfills those needs , " he said .
closed cycle gelleri does n't want to compete with the euro - he says he wants to find a way for money to remain in the region .
so instead of buying apples from new zealand , the locals spend chiemgauers to buy apples from the chiemgau region .
apple growers in turn spend the chiemgauers they 've earned to buy locally made sausages , and the butcher buys meat from local farms , paying in chiemgauers .
it 's a closed regional cycle that benefits everybody in the community , according to gelleri .
the chiemgauer could easily have remained a high school experiment were it not for six tenth-year students in gelleri 's class at the waldorf school .
they volunteered to create and administer the new currency .
" i tried to make the bills simple enough so that they would not be overly expensive to print , but complicated enough to prevent counterfeiting , " said anna seibt , the 16-year old who designed the new bills .
the project wo n't die when anna and her friends graduate .
they have already recruited three apprentices to continue the project in the future .
they also hope to increase the number of merchants who accept the chiemgauer as legal tender .
the next step will be convincing local banks to accept the regional currency and allow electronic money transfers in chiemgauer .
and they 've achieved one big breakthrough already – getting their salaries paid in their own invented currency .
each of the students receives 20 chiemgauer a month for their efforts in keeping the new currency afloat . mariana schröder send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de still mourning the mark nearly one year after the euro went into circulation , two-thirds of germans surveyed say they aren ’ t happy with it .

memberships are up , larger operators continue to expand and bigger centers are on the way .
the prospect of further growth seems unfathomable but by no means impossible . gone are the days when german gyms were filled with arnold schwarzenegger wannabes , pumping aging iron on machines that looked like medieval torture devices in a concerted effort to emulate the austrian bodybuilding icon .
back then ; these pungent temples to physique were mainly the domain of dedicated , mostly male , weightlifters , straining muscle and sinew in minimalist and dingy surroundings .
how times have changed … fitness as a lifestyle choice and , more importantly , a growth industry has changed the demographic of german gym goers .
state-of-the-art cardiovascular and resistance equipment , luxurious surroundings , mtv and wellness annexes bulging with saunas and pools have tempted a new type of client to the clubs .

memberships are up , larger operators continue to expand and bigger centers are on the way .
the prospect of further growth seems unfathomable but by no means impossible . gone are the days when german gyms were filled with arnold schwarzenegger wannabes , pumping aging iron on machines that looked like medieval torture devices in a concerted effort to emulate the austrian bodybuilding icon .
back then ; these pungent temples to physique were mainly the domain of dedicated , mostly male , weightlifters , straining muscle and sinew in minimalist and dingy surroundings .
how times have changed … fitness as a lifestyle choice and , more importantly , a growth industry has changed the demographic of german gym goers .
state-of-the-art cardiovascular and resistance equipment , luxurious surroundings , mtv and wellness annexes bulging with saunas and pools have tempted a new type of client to the clubs .
and the popularity of the lifestyle and promise of “ a new you ” has paid huge dividends to the german fitness market , making it the second largest in europe . growth in the german fitness market has been steadily increasing over the past decade .
according to a 2002 report by business consultancy deloitte and touche , nationwide membership figures for the german fitness sector increased by 155 percent in the ten year period beginning 1992 , averaging around 11 percent growth every year .
that meant that by the end of 2002 , around 5 million germans , almost 6.2 percent of the population , were members of a fitness club . karsten hollasch , the head of the health and fitness competence center at deloitte and touche , spoke to deutsche welle about the reasons for the growing popularity . media presentation of lifestyle bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " public awareness of fitness and wellness has increased through the promotion of the lifestyle , especially in the media , " he said .
" also , it 's a totally different concept to the hardcore bodybuilding of the 80 's .
that had a very small audience .
now it 's slow and easy and it attracts more people . " " the offer concept in germany has also helped .
specializing offers , for example , for women , for those with certain health problems and those into the wellness concept , has created demand over the past five to six years . " of course , while members are working up a sweat , they ’ re also working up a profit for the major centers .
membership fees and other sales generate around € 3.3 billion a year for the fitness segment in germany .
average monthly fees range from € 20 for standard membership in a smaller studio to € 100 + for top range gold card holders . number of clubs reached plateau bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : however , while the cult of the body continues to persuade many people that buff is beautiful , the fitness boom of the nineties seems to have reached a plateau in terms of the number of clubs .
once the trend really kicked in , the number of clubs in germany surged from 4,750 in 1992 to 6,500 in 1999 but hovered around that number for the following three years .
it seemed that the market was being saturated and that the industry had exhausted its raw material - those wanting to pay to exercise . in reality , what was happening - and what is still the case in the german market today - was the rise to dominance of four major players .
together , the fitness company , elixia , fsh future sports and tc holdings continue to grow faster than the overall market that supports them , with a combined membership of around 75 percent of the entire national total . big clubs favor expansion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with these four operators increasing their numbers of sophisticated establishments , offering everything from calorie burning aerobics classes and indoor cycling to shiatsu and aromatherapy , the expanding market in what are essentially fitness malls has led to the slow demise of smaller centers . both the fitness company and elixia have a policy of year-on-year expansion ; the fitness company aiming for 15 new clubs a year , elixia opening three every 12 months .
with the finances generated from membership fees capable of funding such expansion plans , smaller competitors often face the only solution open to them and that is to close down . this hasn ’ t stopped new businesses entering the market .
in july , karstadt warenhaus ag , the leading sports supplies arm of the department store chain karstadtquelle , announced that it was moving into the gym owning business by buying nine clubs from the 24 hour fitness chain and re-branding them under the karstadt name .
with one acquisition , karstadt inherited 28,000 members and a captive audience for its range of sports products .
sources at the company announced at the time that this was just the start of “ a rapid expansion with fitness clubs in the coming years . ” smaller operators dropping away despite the odd would-be usurper , the demand for fitness and wellness centers in germany is likely to keep the larger operators going for some time , despite figures that show the number of studios has reduced by around 1000 in 2003 .
however , this is more likely to be a result of failing businesses . forecasts for 2005 by deloitte and touche show that the larger fitness companies will increase their share as smaller competitors drop away over the next two years .
but there may be an even bigger kid on the block preparing to make its presence felt . country clubs in the ascendence the forecasts predict the emergence of the ‘ super ’ centers , based on the sprawling country club format which has proved popular for the upper-middle to upper class leisure enthusiasts in the u.s. and u.k. these expansive estates usually spread over a 2000sq meter area and contain large pools , tennis courts and sometimes even golf courses .
in the study , the german health & fitness market in the year 2005 , the consultancy predicts that the market share of premium wellness centers and country clubs will increase from 3 percent in 2001 to 9 percent by 2005 . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de golf in germany means much more than vw as the german open golf championship continues in glorious cologne sunshine , the inquisitive observer may look on with bemusement .

gene robinson - who has lived with his male partner for 15 years - was formally made bishop of the us state of new hampshire in a colourful but controversial ceremony on sunday .
three church members were given the opportunity to voice their objections during the ceremony and one woman said the consecration would not only rupture the anglican community but " break god 's heart " .
the effects of this upon the ministry and witness of the overwhelming majority of anglicans particularly in the non-western world have to be confronted with honesty archbishop of canterbury archbishop ' regrets ' divisions within minutes of the service ending , the archbishop of canterbury rowan williams - spiritual head of the anglican church - said the divisions arising in the global anglican communion following the consecration were " a matter of deep regret " .
but the archbishop 's carefully worded statement avoided direct criticism or endorsement of the consecration which he said had been made " in good faith " .
" the effects of this upon the ministry and witness of the overwhelming majority of anglicans particularly in the non-western world have to be confronted with honesty , " he added .
some of the bishop 's opponents say they plan to set up a new church structure with like-minded bishops from the us and abroad .
the bbc 's susannah price , in new hampshire , says his supporters are hoping to avoid a permanent split , but it is too early to tell what the long-term effects of sunday 's consecration will be .
emotional speech the consecration service , at a specially converted ice-hockey arena in the town of durham , was held amid tight security , with police on rooftops and in heavy presence on the street .
about 4,000 people , including 50 american bishops , as well as bishop robinson 's family and parishioners , attended the ceremony .
there was an impassioned standing ovation in the arena before he was presented with brightly coloured vestments by members of his family , including his mother and father .
and then , his voice cracked with emotion , he spoke , saying " you can not imagine what an honour it is for you to have called me . "
he reached out to disgruntled conservatives , saying : " they must know if they must leave , they will always be welcomed back . "
' symbol of unity ' earlier , when presiding bishop frank griswold asked the congregation : " if any of you know any reason why we should not proceed , let it be made known , " three church members made speeches .
i 'm in very good company bishop robinson fact file : anglican churches but the consecration sermon by new hampshire 's retiring bishop douglas theuner was interrupted twice by vigorous applause as he defended robinson .
bishop robinson " will stand as a symbol of the unity of the church in a way none of the rest of us can " , he said outside , protesters and supporters of canon robinson faced each other off , kept apart by mounted police , while a separate service for those against the consecration took place in a church in another part of the town .
some traditionalists , who view homosexuality as a violation of the teachings of the bible , plan to ask the spiritual leader of the world 's anglican christians , archbishop of canterbury dr rowan williams , for permission to split from the church .
but , despite the deep divisions , dr williams has predicted the rift will eventually heal .
" god will still teach us in our separateness ; and one day we shall be led , in both thankfulness and repentance , to share with one another what we have learned apart , " he said before the ceremony .
' at peace ' senior church leaders in africa have been at the forefront of opposition to bishop robinson 's appointment archbishop peter akinola , the primate of the nigerian church , the largest in the anglican community , called the bishop 's sexuality an abomination .
reverend peter karanje , provost of all saints cathedral in nairobi , said he was deeply saddened to hear of the appointment , but he said church leaders in kenya still hoped some way could be found to avert a split in the communion .
speaking before his consecration , gene robinson told the bbc he felt calm and at peace and he was not concerned that he will not be widely accepted as a bishop abroad .
" well , it makes me feel like i 'm in very good company because most of the bishops around the world would n't recognise the ministries or ordinations of our women priests and our women bishops .
" the other fact is that i 'm not welcome now as an openly gay priest in most of those places , " he said .

although the dam has caused controversy overseas because of its environmental and social impact , analysts forecast that the share offer will be vastly over-subscribed .
electricity demands mean a sell-out is likely the massive hydroelectric project is designed to supply a tenth of china 's energy needs and stop devastating floods of the yangtze river .
mention the three gorges dam and most people will think of the relocation of 600,000 people whose homes have been inundated by the rising waters .
the project has also been plagued by fears of an environmental disaster , corruption and concerns about building standards .
but none of these factors seem likely to make a dent on share sales .
from monday , institutional investors can apply for shares in the project , which they will then be allocated according to demand .
the yangtze electric power company is hoping to raise more than $ 1bn in this way and analysts say they expect the offer to be over-subscribed by up to 70 times .
that is because there is an enormous demand for electricity to fuel china 's economic boom and many see these shares as a risk-free investment .
market watchers say the offer is so large and investors are so keen to be part of it , that it has been driving down the market as people cashed in other shares to buy up these ones .
and while the offer seems certain to be a sell-out , some analysts are warning that given the scale of the project and the number of concerns dogging it , it is not necessarily a safe long-term investment .

that is because there is an enormous demand for electricity to fuel china 's economic boom and many see these shares as a risk-free investment .
market watchers say the offer is so large and investors are so keen to be part of it , that it has been driving down the market as people cashed in other shares to buy up these ones .
and while the offer seems certain to be a sell-out , some analysts are warning that given the scale of the project and the number of concerns dogging it , it is not necessarily a safe long-term investment .

although the dam has caused controversy overseas because of its environmental and social impact , analysts forecast that the share offer will be vastly over-subscribed .
the massive hydroelectric project is designed to supply a tenth of china 's energy needs and stop devastating floods of the yangtze river .
mention the three gorges dam and most people will think of the relocation of 600,000 people whose homes have been inundated by the rising waters .
the project has also been plagued by fears of an environmental disaster , corruption and concerns about building standards .
but none of these factors seem likely to make a dent on share sales .
from monday , institutional investors can apply for shares in the project , which they will then be allocated according to demand .
the yangtze electric power company is hoping to raise more than $ 1bn in this way and analysts say they expect the offer to be over-subscribed by up to 70 times .

shaun macdonald , who farms at conon brae on the black isle in ross-shire , has written to msps after he was crushed and had his nose broken after being attacked by one of his own cows .
mr macdonald had been tagging a young calf along with a cattle-man when the angry mother suddenly turned on him , leaving him black and blue .
he has called for the scottish executive to consider removing landowners ' liability to prosecution in case the promotion of greater public access to land leads to accidents .
it needs to be taken on board that at some point we could have a fatality and then where will we point the finger ?
shaun macdonald farmer but a spokeswoman for the executive 's rural development department said they did not foresee any need specifically to protect landowners in this way .
mr macdonald said the attack took place while he was tagging the calf in an enclosed space with its mother .
he said the cow rushed him without warning , tossed him into the air twice and bore down on him with its hooves and head , breaking his nose .
" with the help of donald , who was with me , we managed to distract her and scramble to a hay hake and got away , " he recalled .
" i got through to a & e in inverness covered in blood and it was only as i sat and waited i was able to calm down . "
the attack took place at mr macdonald 's farm mr macdonald has now written to several highland msps to highlight the risks related to plans for increased promotion of access to the countryside .
he said his experience , as someone who was well equipped and working under proper handling conditions , demonstrates the dangers that walkers and ramblers could face .
" it needs to be taken on board that at some point we could have a fatality and then where will we point the finger ? " he asked .
mr macdonald said he provides facilities for school farm visits and backs the use of existing rights of way .
but he believes that if greater public access to land is to be encouraged it should not fall to farmers to foot the bill if this leads to injuries .
" who will get prosecuted ?
the scottish executive should be prepared to accept responsibility should anyone prosecute for any unfortunate accident . "
we have been at pains to stress that if someone wanders into a field and gets gored by a bull the farmer should not be liable nfu spokesman the executive spokeswoman said the scottish outdoor access code was currently being reviewed before being presented to ministers .
" the responsible exercise of access will not increase the duty of care of landowners , " she said .
" the occupiers liability -lrb- scotland -rrb- act 1960 has therefore not been amended . "
a spokesman for the national farmers union said : " we are waiting for the access code to be agreed but it is important that new rights do not increase legal liability .

land reform " with the access code we will need proper education and a decent network of paths to reassure both the farmers and the public that they can be safe . "
consultation has been taking place over the summer on the draft scottish outdoor access code is to promote responsible behaviour by users and land managers .

shaun macdonald , who farms at conon brae on the black isle in ross-shire , has written to msps after he was crushed and had his nose broken after being attacked by one of his own cows .
mr macdonald had been tagging a young calf along with a cattle-man when the angry mother suddenly turned on him , leaving him black and blue .
he has called for the scottish executive to consider removing landowners ' liability to prosecution in case the promotion of greater public access to land leads to accidents .
it needs to be taken on board that at some point we could have a fatality and then where will we point the finger ?
shaun macdonald farmer but a spokeswoman for the executive 's rural development department said they did not foresee any need specifically to protect landowners in this way .
mr macdonald said the attack took place while he was tagging the calf in an enclosed space with its mother .
he said the cow rushed him without warning , tossed him into the air twice and bore down on him with its hooves and head , breaking his nose .
" with the help of donald , who was with me , we managed to distract her and scramble to a hay hake and got away , " he recalled .

the attack took place at mr macdonald 's farm mr macdonald has now written to several highland msps to highlight the risks related to plans for increased promotion of access to the countryside .
he said his experience , as someone who was well equipped and working under proper handling conditions , demonstrates the dangers that walkers and ramblers could face .
" it needs to be taken on board that at some point we could have a fatality and then where will we point the finger ? " he asked .
mr macdonald said he provides facilities for school farm visits and backs the use of existing rights of way .
but he believes that if greater public access to land is to be encouraged it should not fall to farmers to foot the bill if this leads to injuries .
" who will get prosecuted ?
the scottish executive should be prepared to accept responsibility should anyone prosecute for any unfortunate accident . "
we have been at pains to stress that if someone wanders into a field and gets gored by a bull the farmer should not be liable nfu spokesman the executive spokeswoman said the scottish outdoor access code was currently being reviewed before being presented to ministers .
" the responsible exercise of access will not increase the duty of care of landowners , " she said .
" the occupiers liability -lrb- scotland -rrb- act 1960 has therefore not been amended . "
a spokesman for the national farmers union said : " we are waiting for the access code to be agreed but it is important that new rights do not increase legal liability .
" we have been at pains to stress that if someone wanders into a field and gets gored by a bull the farmer should not be liable .
land reform " with the access code we will need proper education and a decent network of paths to reassure both the farmers and the public that they can be safe . "

amicus and the iron and steel trades confederation -lrb- istc -rrb- on monday accused the government of failing to implement a european union directive aimed at safeguarding the pensions of workers in firms which go into receivership .
the action is being taken in support of 1,000 workers who lost their jobs earlier this year when steel firm asw - which had factories in cardiff and sheerness - kent , fell into receivership .
cardiff west mp kevin brennan has raised the subject of what he described as a pensions " scandal " during a debate in the house of commons .
he called on the government to investigate reform of the system which has led to some of the workers paying into an occupational pension scheme for over 40 years but now facing losing thousands of pounds .
many have been told they will receive half their promised pensions while others have been warned they could get 10 % .
retirement hardship the two unions taking legal action said they believed the government 's failure to properly implement the eu directive had left workers facing hardship in retirement .
the workers would only receive a fraction of the pension for which they had saved over many years , the unions said .
istc general secretary michael leahy and amicus assistant general secretary paul talbot , accompanied by former asw workers , delivered the writ to the department of work and pensions headquarters in london on monday .
the unions expect the case to be heard in the high court early next year before being transferred to the european court of justice .
a dwp spokesman said : " it is not appropriate to comment on any such legal action . "
he added that the department had taken strong interest in the asw case but did not wish to raise false hopes .

amicus and the iron and steel trades confederation -lrb- istc -rrb- on monday accused the government of failing to implement a european union directive aimed at safeguarding the pensions of workers in firms which go into receivership .
the action is being taken in support of 1,000 workers who lost their jobs earlier this year when steel firm asw - which had factories in cardiff and sheerness - kent , fell into receivership .
cardiff west mp kevin brennan has raised the subject of what he described as a pensions " scandal " during a debate in the house of commons .
he called on the government to investigate reform of the system which has led to some of the workers paying into an occupational pension scheme for over 40 years but now facing losing thousands of pounds .
many have been told they will receive half their promised pensions while others have been warned they could get 10 % .
retirement hardship the two unions taking legal action said they believed the government 's failure to properly implement the eu directive had left workers facing hardship in retirement .
the workers would only receive a fraction of the pension for which they had saved over many years , the unions said .
istc general secretary michael leahy and amicus assistant general secretary paul talbot , accompanied by former asw workers , delivered the writ to the department of work and pensions headquarters in london on monday .
the unions expect the case to be heard in the high court early next year before being transferred to the european court of justice .
a dwp spokesman said : " it is not appropriate to comment on any such legal action . "
he added that the department had taken strong interest in the asw case but did not wish to raise false hopes .

the siren , at hms raleigh in torpoint , is one of the devonport nuclear accident alarms and has been designed to ensure that anyone living within a two-kilometre-wide zone will hear it in all weather conditions .
existing nuclear accident alarms for the navy are located on the plymouth side of the river tamar , spread across navy sites in devonport .
but the new alarm has been installed because there was concern that in certain winds people in the torpoint area would not hear them .
nuclear repairs the navy 's devonport site covers more than 650 acres , is home to seven nuclear-powered submarines on active service and has repair facilities for other nuclear vessels .
the navy sent letters to everyone living in the torpoint and wilcove area to let them know about the additional siren .
it says that although the existing sirens are already audible in this area , the new one will mean that the area it covers is increased , exceeding the minimum legal requirements .
but it also means that people living in millbrook , antony and st john will hear the siren for the first time .
it was tested at 1130 gmt , and sounded similar to an air-raid siren .
it lasted for one minute and was followed by an " all clear " for half a minute .
depending on the wind direction , the navy says people living further afield in st germans , polbathick , sheviock and kingsand and cawsand may also hear the alarm .
further information on what to do in the unlikely event the siren is ever activated for real can be found at local libraries in the area .

the siren , at hms raleigh in torpoint , is one of the devonport nuclear accident alarms and has been designed to ensure that anyone living within a two-kilometre-wide zone will hear it in all weather conditions .
existing nuclear accident alarms for the navy are located on the plymouth side of the river tamar , spread across navy sites in devonport .
but the new alarm has been installed because there was concern that in certain winds people in the torpoint area would not hear them .
nuclear repairs the navy 's devonport site covers more than 650 acres , is home to seven nuclear-powered submarines on active service and has repair facilities for other nuclear vessels .
the navy sent letters to everyone living in the torpoint and wilcove area to let them know about the additional siren .
it says that although the existing sirens are already audible in this area , the new one will mean that the area it covers is increased , exceeding the minimum legal requirements .
but it also means that people living in millbrook , antony and st john will hear the siren for the first time .
it was tested at 1130 gmt , and sounded similar to an air-raid siren .
it lasted for one minute and was followed by an " all clear " for half a minute .
depending on the wind direction , the navy says people living further afield in st germans , polbathick , sheviock and kingsand and cawsand may also hear the alarm .
further information on what to do in the unlikely event the siren is ever activated for real can be found at local libraries in the area .

mark palfrey , president of the jersey building and allied trade employers federation , says it would help remove so-called " cowboys " .
he claims it is difficult to know how competent people applying for employment are and so every time someone starts a new job , they have to be trained .
he said a document which identified people 's work background would help people ensure they are employing professional staff .
in the meantime , it is claimed enquiries about building projects in jersey have halved in the past 18 months .

mark palfrey , president of the jersey building and allied trade employers federation , says it would help remove so-called " cowboys " .

in the meantime , it is claimed enquiries about building projects in jersey have halved in the past 18 months .

the inuit say their livelihood is at stake the case is a classic david and goliath trial of strength between george bush 's superpower and the smallest indigenous people on earth .
lawyers representing the inuit claim their survival is at stake .
" i think its in the world 's interest that this last surviving group of polar eskimos can not be allowed to disappear and perish , ¿ says lead attorney christian harlang .
clad in white sealskin boots and white fur trousers , fashioned from a polar bear he tracked and killed , nussaqak qujaukitsoq , a 56 year old hunter , cut an incongruous figure on copenhagen 's fashionable streets .
he flew in from greenland for the five day long hearing , which begins on monday november 3rd .
" i promised my father on his death bed , that i would pursue this fight all the way ... until we can return to our land .
i wo n't stop until i have fulfilled my vow , ¿ he declared .
mr qujaukitsoq was a toddler when he and other inuit families were forcibly evicted from their ancestral lands in northern greenland by the ruling danish authorities .
they were exiled 100 miles away to enable the united states to establish what is now the thule airbase .
during the cold war , thule 's location on top of the world and its proximity to the former soviet union enabled the us to monitor the military activities of its rival superpower and , most importantly , to give early warning of any possible first nuclear strike .
since the 1950 's thule has evolved into america 's ear on the northern hemisphere and has surveillance technology similar to that contained in the mysterious white globes at raf fylingdales in north yorkshire .
right of return washington is planning to upgrade the radar and is also seeking danish permission to use the base as a part of the putative ' star wars ' national missile defence system .
the americans will not be represented in court as this dispute is strictly between the inuit and the danish government .
a spokesman for the us embassy in copenhagen said , " we are keeping a close eye on the case . "
us diplomats will be hoping that the supreme court 's decision , expected on november 28th , mirrors an earlier ruling by denmark 's eastern high court .
four years ago , its justices determined that the inuit had been illegally exiled against their will .
which nation ever managed to close down a us base ?
aqqaluk lynge , greenland mp but , critically , the judges ruled that the hunters had no right of return .
this element of their judgement is being appealed in the supreme court .
mr harlang will tell the bench that thule 's perimeters contain the only fertile hunting territory with sufficient whales , fish and other arctic creatures capable of sustaining the inuit in the manner in which they have lived for thousands of years .
" their current home to which they were exiled in 1953 can not support them as before , ¿ says aqqaluk lynge , a member of the greenland ' parliament ' and president of the inuit circumpolar conference .
environmental damage in his book , ' right of return ' , mr lynge writes : " the numbers of animals within reasonable hunting distances are simply insufficient .
" if the court rules against their desire , their need and right to return to the land which can sustain them , the inuit will , in all likelihood , join other indigenous peoples globally whose language , culture and presence are no longer with us . "
the greenlanders , who have limited autonomy under danish rule , are seeking greater sovereignty and involvement in discussions over america 's presence in their land .
while they dream of kicking out the us military completely , the best they can hope for is compromise .
the pro-independence party may move back into government ' which nation ever managed to close down a us base ? " shrugs mr lynge , during an interview with the times .
" but the americans have to learn that you do n't kick people out of their homes , even in greenland .
you do n't deprive people of their livelihood .
" we have to send a message through the supreme court , that the americans must respect our human rights . "
denmark 's prime minister anders fogh rasmussen has been one of the strongest supporters of president bush 's military adventures in afghanistan and iraq .
if the government loses the case , it may have to decide whether to expropriate the land to enable the american presence to continue .
" we keep hearing that america and denmark have democracy .
but they do n't apply it to us small people .
all they do is dictate , ¿ concludes mr qujaukitsoq .
its not certain what long term environmental damage thule has done to the inuit 's hunting grounds .
in 1968 a b-52 bomber , carrying nuclear weapons , crashed into the sea , leaking plutonium into greenland 's waters .
ironically , the americans had to ask the inuit hunters for help in their search and rescue efforts , because they were the only ones who knew the territory intimately and who could find their way in the bad weather .

the inuit say their livelihood is at stake the case is a classic david and goliath trial of strength between george bush 's superpower and the smallest indigenous people on earth .
lawyers representing the inuit claim their survival is at stake .
" i think its in the world 's interest that this last surviving group of polar eskimos can not be allowed to disappear and perish , ¿ says lead attorney christian harlang .
clad in white sealskin boots and white fur trousers , fashioned from a polar bear he tracked and killed , nussaqak qujaukitsoq , a 56 year old hunter , cut an incongruous figure on copenhagen 's fashionable streets .
he flew in from greenland for the five day long hearing , which begins on monday november 3rd .
" i promised my father on his death bed , that i would pursue this fight all the way ... until we can return to our land .
i wo n't stop until i have fulfilled my vow , ¿ he declared .
mr qujaukitsoq was a toddler when he and other inuit families were forcibly evicted from their ancestral lands in northern greenland by the ruling danish authorities .
they were exiled 100 miles away to enable the united states to establish what is now the thule airbase .
during the cold war , thule 's location on top of the world and its proximity to the former soviet union enabled the us to monitor the military activities of its rival superpower and , most importantly , to give early warning of any possible first nuclear strike .
since the 1950 's thule has evolved into america 's ear on the northern hemisphere and has surveillance technology similar to that contained in the mysterious white globes at raf fylingdales in north yorkshire .
right of return washington is planning to upgrade the radar and is also seeking danish permission to use the base as a part of the putative ' star wars ' national missile defence system .
the americans will not be represented in court as this dispute is strictly between the inuit and the danish government .
a spokesman for the us embassy in copenhagen said , " we are keeping a close eye on the case . "
us diplomats will be hoping that the supreme court 's decision , expected on november 28th , mirrors an earlier ruling by denmark 's eastern high court .
four years ago , its justices determined that the inuit had been illegally exiled against their will .
which nation ever managed to close down a us base ?
aqqaluk lynge , greenland mp but , critically , the judges ruled that the hunters had no right of return .
this element of their judgement is being appealed in the supreme court .
mr harlang will tell the bench that thule 's perimeters contain the only fertile hunting territory with sufficient whales , fish and other arctic creatures capable of sustaining the inuit in the manner in which they have lived for thousands of years .
" their current home to which they were exiled in 1953 can not support them as before , ¿ says aqqaluk lynge , a member of the greenland ' parliament ' and president of the inuit circumpolar conference .
environmental damage in his book , ' right of return ' , mr lynge writes : " the numbers of animals within reasonable hunting distances are simply insufficient .
" if the court rules against their desire , their need and right to return to the land which can sustain them , the inuit will , in all likelihood , join other indigenous peoples globally whose language , culture and presence are no longer with us . "
the greenlanders , who have limited autonomy under danish rule , are seeking greater sovereignty and involvement in discussions over america 's presence in their land .

the bustard is the heaviest flying bird in the world and disappeared from the uk countryside in the 1870s .
the great bustard group was set up by enthusiasts in south wiltshire five years ago to reintroduce the rare bird .
in 2003 , it applied for a government licence to import chicks from russia , a licence now granted by defra minister ben bradshaw .
a total of 40 chicks will be reintroduced to salisbury plain every year for the next ten years , with the first batch due to arrive next june . "
foxes are the greatest threat to their survival , but the normal survival rate in the wild is 25 % " david walters great bustard group david walters , chairman of the great bustard group , told the bbc : " this is new ground for everyone .
" the birds are legally defined as a non-native species and this is partly why the process has taken so long .
" foxes are the greatest threat to their survival , but the normal survival rate in the wild is 25 % and there are less foxes here than in russia .
" if we can match or exceed that , there should be a self-sustaining population in wiltshire in the next five years . "
the great bustard is normally found in russia , northern europe and the iberian peninsula .
ornithologists from russia recently visited the uk to advise the project .

mandy power , her two daughters katie and emily and her mother doris dawson , were beaten to death in a savage attack at their home , which was set alight to try to destroy forensic evidence .
the programme raised questions over the investigation into the deaths , revealing serious failures to follow up potentially vital leads .
following the programme , sir anthony said : " " we are disappointed with the broadcasting of a programme that has clearly set out to undermine all the excellent work this force does in investigating major crime .
" our decision not to take part in the panorama programme was based on independent legal advice , which centred on the legal proceedings that are ongoing .
" we were not prepared to take the very real risk of undermining that legal process , simply so that we could defend our position . "
i am sure the people of south wales would not want to see justice potentially prejudiced by comments made by us to support our position " sir anthony burden " for the same reasons we can not , at this time , respond in any detail to the allegations made against south wales police in the programme .
" i am sure the people of south wales , and certainly the victims and their families who have already suffered enough tragedy , would not want to see justice potentially prejudiced by comments made by us to support our position . "
he said the force may take the opportunity to respond in the future when the legal process " is no longer at risk " .
the force had been " honest , professional and transparent " in reviewing and reinvestigating all unsolved and unresolved murder cases , according to sir anthony .
" we have worked very closely with the families , keeping them updated on every development , and we have used independent reviewers , with independent oversight at every stage , " he said .
south wales police dealt with 356 murder investigations over 20 years , only five of which were miscarriages of justice , sir anthony added , saying not all were overturned due to the original police investigation .
" however , we fully accept that one case is one too many , and we take our commitment to dealing with the reviews very seriously and as a priority .
' complex ' " we have already had significant successes in the cases of geraldine palk , the llandarcy murders , patricia simpson and most recently , lynette white , a case that we reviewed and reinvestigated .
" a conviction was secured , and we are now carrying out a detailed inquiry into the original investigation , " he said .
" the very nature of such detailed re-examination of what are extremely complex investigations means that each takes a considerable amount of time .
" we have committed significant resources to the review programme and we will continue our commitment until it has been completed .
" at the same time we will continue to respond to today 's serious crime investigations and will continue to do so professionally and effectively . "

bbc news online looks at book collecting in the latest in its series on fun investments .
the popularity of auction and collecting programmes on television has made everyone aware that there may be unrealised assets in everyone 's homes .
and the recent success of the harry potter and lord of the rings films have boosted the prices of the books on which they were based , making bibliophiles everywhere wonder if they have a rarity among their collection .
rarity does not necessarily make a book marketable clive farahar , farahardupre clive farahar , of bookdealers farahardupre , has featured on the bbc 's antiques roadshow programme .
he said : " there has been a great increase in book collecting in recent years .
" members of the public are realising that the books on their shelves might be valuable . "
as part of the boom , a set of harry potter first editions can now sell for at least £ 25,000 .
twenty years ago a set of the three lord of rings volumes , published in the mid-1950s , were selling for between £ 800 and £ 1,000 .
now a set goes for between £ 17,000 and £ 25,000 .
mr farahar said : " there has been a rise in " trophy-collecting " , where people want to be to say they have a complete set of harry potter books .
" you would probably not want to even open those books in case you cracked the spine .
" what is wrong with something like tolkien , is that the price has been going up far too fast , it could plummet again in the same way after rising so quickly . "
children 's books so what should the new collector of modest means , looking to perhaps make a profit from his or her hobby , look to buy ?
like shares or any other type of investing , the value of your purchase might go down as well as up clive farahar , farahardupre " people should initially buy books because they are interested in the subject matter , not necessarily because they think they are going to make a fortune out of it .
" buy books that you like , that you can relate to , then if it does not make a great price in later years at least you will have a book that you still want to own . "
he added : " children 's books are always well-worth collecting , and are a popular subject among book buyers .
" i would suggest something like pop-up books are worth buying .
" they are available for only a few pounds in remaindered book shops , yet very few will remain in good condition in years to come after children have had their hands on them .
" this could turn out to be a good investment years down the line . "
growth areas it may come as a surprise to bookworms but rare volumes are not necessarily the ones that fetch the most money .
mr farahar said : " rarity does not necessarily make a book marketable .
something that is fairly common can still fetch a higher price .
" growth areas are modern first editions and 19th century travel books , yet there are much rarer books than them .
" but when there are a lot of a desirable book people can compare different copies in different condition , with collectors trying to find a copy in the best-possible condition .
collecting points to remember buy books you are interested in buy in as good condition as possible modern first editions should remain unread if possible try to buy from a reputable dealer rare does not necessarily mean desirable " you go back to the 17th and 18th centuries , the books are much rarer , but the markets for them are much more stable and not subject to sudden crazes - which is not necessarily a bad thing . "
other stable markets over the years have been in works by favourites such as graham greene and ian fleming .
he said : " graham greene is very good , and ian fleming has been very stable over the past 30 years - he has been fetching very high prices for the bond books , and growth has remained fairly stable . "
established dealers so , once you decide what to collect , where should you look to buy ?
he said : " the internet is slightly unregulated , however , it is a very useful tool for checking current prices . "
one online marketplace is abe , where buyers can search from titles for sale by dealers from around the world .
other internet sites of use are those of the uk-based independent booksellers ' network , and ukbookworld.com , which also allow potential buyers the chance to search dealers ' stock lists .
this harry potter first edition sold for £ 13,500 at auction in 2003 there are also auctions held by the major names such as sotheby 's and bonhams , but items turning up in these houses are likely to be beyond the pocket of the new collector .
however , most towns and cities in the country have auction houses and these are worth checking for sales of books .
gems can also turn up in charity shops , car-boot sales , and organised book fairs , and journal book and magazine collector carries book advertising and articles .
but mr farahar : " it is always best to deal with your established friendly bookdealer .

bbc news online looks at book collecting in the latest in its series on fun investments .
the popularity of auction and collecting programmes on television has made everyone aware that there may be unrealised assets in everyone 's homes .
and the recent success of the harry potter and lord of the rings films have boosted the prices of the books on which they were based , making bibliophiles everywhere wonder if they have a rarity among their collection .
rarity does not necessarily make a book marketable clive farahar , farahardupre clive farahar , of bookdealers farahardupre , has featured on the bbc 's antiques roadshow programme .
he said : " there has been a great increase in book collecting in recent years .
" members of the public are realising that the books on their shelves might be valuable . "
as part of the boom , a set of harry potter first editions can now sell for at least £ 25,000 .
twenty years ago a set of the three lord of rings volumes , published in the mid-1950s , were selling for between £ 800 and £ 1,000 .
now a set goes for between £ 17,000 and £ 25,000 .
mr farahar said : " there has been a rise in " trophy-collecting " , where people want to be to say they have a complete set of harry potter books .
" you would probably not want to even open those books in case you cracked the spine .
" what is wrong with something like tolkien , is that the price has been going up far too fast , it could plummet again in the same way after rising so quickly . "
children 's books so what should the new collector of modest means , looking to perhaps make a profit from his or her hobby , look to buy ?
like shares or any other type of investing , the value of your purchase might go down as well as up clive farahar , farahardupre " people should initially buy books because they are interested in the subject matter , not necessarily because they think they are going to make a fortune out of it .
" buy books that you like , that you can relate to , then if it does not make a great price in later years at least you will have a book that you still want to own . "
he added : " children 's books are always well-worth collecting , and are a popular subject among book buyers .
" i would suggest something like pop-up books are worth buying .
" they are available for only a few pounds in remaindered book shops , yet very few will remain in good condition in years to come after children have had their hands on them .
" this could turn out to be a good investment years down the line . "
growth areas it may come as a surprise to bookworms but rare volumes are not necessarily the ones that fetch the most money .
mr farahar said : " rarity does not necessarily make a book marketable .
something that is fairly common can still fetch a higher price .
" growth areas are modern first editions and 19th century travel books , yet there are much rarer books than them .
" but when there are a lot of a desirable book people can compare different copies in different condition , with collectors trying to find a copy in the best-possible condition .
collecting points to remember buy books you are interested in buy in as good condition as possible modern first editions should remain unread if possible try to buy from a reputable dealer rare does not necessarily mean desirable " you go back to the 17th and 18th centuries , the books are much rarer , but the markets for them are much more stable and not subject to sudden crazes - which is not necessarily a bad thing . "
other stable markets over the years have been in works by favourites such as graham greene and ian fleming .
he said : " graham greene is very good , and ian fleming has been very stable over the past 30 years - he has been fetching very high prices for the bond books , and growth has remained fairly stable . "
established dealers so , once you decide what to collect , where should you look to buy ?
he said : " the internet is slightly unregulated , however , it is a very useful tool for checking current prices . "
one online marketplace is abe , where buyers can search from titles for sale by dealers from around the world .
other internet sites of use are those of the uk-based independent booksellers ' network , and ukbookworld.com , which also allow potential buyers the chance to search dealers ' stock lists .
this harry potter first edition sold for £ 13,500 at auction in 2003 there are also auctions held by the major names such as sotheby 's and bonhams , but items turning up in these houses are likely to be beyond the pocket of the new collector .
however , most towns and cities in the country have auction houses and these are worth checking for sales of books .
gems can also turn up in charity shops , car-boot sales , and organised book fairs , and journal book and magazine collector carries book advertising and articles .

october was the ftse 100 's best month since april , but concerns over rising interest rates are starting to weigh on investor optimism .
bbc news online asked four forecasters - from widely different professional backgrounds - how they rate the prospects for share prices over the next six months .
the historian veteran stockwatcher david schwartz gauges how the market is likely to move in the months ahead by analysing its past behaviour .
in december 2000 , he correctly forecast that the nasdaq index of technology shares , then at about 4,000 , would eventually dip below 1,500 .
david schwartz sees more pain ahead for investors and after the 11 september attacks , he predicted - again correctly - that the us market would fall by about 15 % before starting to recover .
mr schwartz sees the current global share price rally as a short-lived blip in a wider downward trend as the market continues to surrender the gains it notched up during the 1980s and 1990s .
" i honestly believe that there 's a lot more downside to come , " he says .
" i think history teaches us that for every major price run-up over the last two centuries , there has always been a return to the long-term trend line . "
he believes that efforts by the us government to stimulate the economy ahead of next year 's presidential elections could help sustain wall street for a few months yet .
but he expects share prices to start heading south again at some point next year .
" as we near the end of december we could have a father christmas rally , and we could well go up again in the first quarter . "
" but some time in 2004 , it will be payback time . "
the chartist chartists , or technical analysts , try to forecast stock market movements by spotting and extrapolating trends using graphs and charts .
nigel blake of city brokers blue index expects steady if unspectacular progress on the uk stock market over the next six months .
the ftse has been heading higher , slipping , taking a breath , and then moving on nigel blake , blue index he predicts that the ftse 100 will close at about 4,380 on new year 's eve , 300 points higher than at the start of the year , and up by a third on the low of 3,300 recorded in mid-march .
after marking time early in the new year , it will then head higher again , moving towards 4,500 by the beginning of april .
" this fits the pattern the ftse has been moving in recently , " mr blake says .
" it 's been heading higher , slipping , taking a breath , retracing , and then moving on . "
mr blake also expects the ftse to move far more steadily in the months ahead , in contrast to the wild fluctuations seen earlier this year .
this would be good news for private investors , who tend to be put off by excessive volatility .
the physicist professor didier sornette of the university of california has built up a sideline as a stocks pundit since realising that a method of predicting when engineering materials will rupture under strain could be adapted to stock market analysis .
his approach is based on the theory that stock market bubbles are influenced in part by " cooperative herding " among investors .
didier sornette : s & p ' heading for a fall ' he believes that forces of this kind are in play at the moment , and predicts that the s & p 500 index - the broadest measure of us share prices - will reach the peak of its current rally by the end of this year before falling back again .
he is unsure over the severity of the decline , and acknowledges that tax cuts and low interest rates could prop up the us market into early 2004 .
but professor sornette is confident that there is a sustained downturn in the pipeline , estimating the probability of his forecast being proved wrong at no more than 30 % .
" when artificially held up by strong incentives , the rally can keep going for a while .
but in that scenario , the collapse , when it comes , will be even greater , " he says .
professor sornette also has bad news for british homeowners .
he has applied his forecasting model to the uk property market , and has concluded that it too will start to turn sour at the end of 2003 .
the astrologer few investors will admit to consulting astrologers .
but it is by no means unknown for traders to use astrological analysis alongside more conventional forecasting techniques for guidance .
christeen skinner : bullish on gold christeen skinner , a london-based astrologer who regularly shares information with city figures , says the stars paint a mixed picture for investors in the months ahead .
the big winner will be gold , which she expects to break through the $ 400 an ounce barrier before the end of the year .
she also believes that the technology sector - including " third generation " mobile phone operators - could get a new year boost thanks to a rare alignment between pisces and uranus on 30 december .
this is because uranus is associated with technology , while pisces is linked to visual entertainment .
on the downside , ms skinner believes the current decline in the value of dollar could accelerate sharply in late november .
and the malign influence of saturn on cancer - the star sign of the us , which celebrates its national day on 4 july - hints at tough times ahead on wall street .
" it does n't look as though the us market will have a very jolly ride next year , " she says .
the views expressed are solely those of the interviewees and are not those of the bbc .
they are for general information only and do not constitute financial or investment advice .
the information is not intended to be relied upon for the purposes of making an investment decision .
always obtain independent advice from a qualified , registered financial adviser before making any investment decisions .

october was the ftse 100 's best month since april , but concerns over rising interest rates are starting to weigh on investor optimism .
bbc news online asked four forecasters - from widely different professional backgrounds - how they rate the prospects for share prices over the next six months .
the historian veteran stockwatcher david schwartz gauges how the market is likely to move in the months ahead by analysing its past behaviour .
in december 2000 , he correctly forecast that the nasdaq index of technology shares , then at about 4,000 , would eventually dip below 1,500 .
david schwartz sees more pain ahead for investors and after the 11 september attacks , he predicted - again correctly - that the us market would fall by about 15 % before starting to recover .
mr schwartz sees the current global share price rally as a short-lived blip in a wider downward trend as the market continues to surrender the gains it notched up during the 1980s and 1990s .
" i honestly believe that there 's a lot more downside to come , " he says .
" i think history teaches us that for every major price run-up over the last two centuries , there has always been a return to the long-term trend line . "
he believes that efforts by the us government to stimulate the economy ahead of next year 's presidential elections could help sustain wall street for a few months yet .
but he expects share prices to start heading south again at some point next year .
" as we near the end of december we could have a father christmas rally , and we could well go up again in the first quarter . "
" but some time in 2004 , it will be payback time . "
the chartist chartists , or technical analysts , try to forecast stock market movements by spotting and extrapolating trends using graphs and charts .
nigel blake of city brokers blue index expects steady if unspectacular progress on the uk stock market over the next six months .
the ftse has been heading higher , slipping , taking a breath , and then moving on nigel blake , blue index he predicts that the ftse 100 will close at about 4,380 on new year 's eve , 300 points higher than at the start of the year , and up by a third on the low of 3,300 recorded in mid-march .
after marking time early in the new year , it will then head higher again , moving towards 4,500 by the beginning of april .
" this fits the pattern the ftse has been moving in recently , " mr blake says .
" it 's been heading higher , slipping , taking a breath , retracing , and then moving on . "
mr blake also expects the ftse to move far more steadily in the months ahead , in contrast to the wild fluctuations seen earlier this year .
this would be good news for private investors , who tend to be put off by excessive volatility .
the physicist professor didier sornette of the university of california has built up a sideline as a stocks pundit since realising that a method of predicting when engineering materials will rupture under strain could be adapted to stock market analysis .
his approach is based on the theory that stock market bubbles are influenced in part by " cooperative herding " among investors .
didier sornette : s & p ' heading for a fall ' he believes that forces of this kind are in play at the moment , and predicts that the s & p 500 index - the broadest measure of us share prices - will reach the peak of its current rally by the end of this year before falling back again .
he is unsure over the severity of the decline , and acknowledges that tax cuts and low interest rates could prop up the us market into early 2004 .
but professor sornette is confident that there is a sustained downturn in the pipeline , estimating the probability of his forecast being proved wrong at no more than 30 % .
" when artificially held up by strong incentives , the rally can keep going for a while .
but in that scenario , the collapse , when it comes , will be even greater , " he says .
professor sornette also has bad news for british homeowners .
he has applied his forecasting model to the uk property market , and has concluded that it too will start to turn sour at the end of 2003 .
the astrologer few investors will admit to consulting astrologers .
but it is by no means unknown for traders to use astrological analysis alongside more conventional forecasting techniques for guidance .
christeen skinner : bullish on gold christeen skinner , a london-based astrologer who regularly shares information with city figures , says the stars paint a mixed picture for investors in the months ahead .
the big winner will be gold , which she expects to break through the $ 400 an ounce barrier before the end of the year .
she also believes that the technology sector - including " third generation " mobile phone operators - could get a new year boost thanks to a rare alignment between pisces and uranus on 30 december .
this is because uranus is associated with technology , while pisces is linked to visual entertainment .
on the downside , ms skinner believes the current decline in the value of dollar could accelerate sharply in late november .
and the malign influence of saturn on cancer - the star sign of the us , which celebrates its national day on 4 july - hints at tough times ahead on wall street .
" it does n't look as though the us market will have a very jolly ride next year , " she says .
