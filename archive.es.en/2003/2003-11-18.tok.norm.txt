security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .
president to be toppled along with displaying over 3,000 “ stop bush ” placards as they march through central london , protestors are set to topple an effigy of president bush in trafalgar square in much the same way as a statue representing iraqi dictator saddam hussein was pulled down by u.s. tanks in baghdad in april .
the metropolitan police have hired about 250 mini-vans to ship officers equipped with body-length riot shields , cs gas and batons to the scene if the protests turn violent . blair defends invite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tony blair will once again meet bush despite opposition .
however , as the crowds prepared to swarm on the capital , the prime minister insisted on tuesday that he stood by the decision to invite president bush to britain .
“ this is the right moment for us to stand firm with the united states in defeating terrorism , wherever it is , and delivering us safely from what i genuinely believe to be the security threat of the 21st century , ” he said . polls show a divided nation despite the prospect of massive public protests , the opinion of the british people as a whole is hard to gauge .
in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .
the same poll showed that more than half of labour party supporters questioned -lrb- 51 percent -rrb- approved of the visit , against 34 percent who would prefer the president to stay away .
the security bill for the president ’ s visit is expected to cost britain 's taxpayers in the range of ₤ 4 million .
that 's a hefty $ 6.7 million -lrb- € 5.7 million -rrb- bill for a three-day guest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair tells congress : history will forgive british prime minister tony blair told the u.s. congress on thursday that if no weapons of mass destruction were found in iraq , at least the world was rid of a brutal dictator .

security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .
president to be toppled along with displaying over 3,000 “ stop bush ” placards as they march through central london , protestors are set to topple an effigy of president bush in trafalgar square in much the same way as a statue representing iraqi dictator saddam hussein was pulled down by u.s. tanks in baghdad in april .
the metropolitan police have hired about 250 mini-vans to ship officers equipped with body-length riot shields , cs gas and batons to the scene if the protests turn violent . blair defends invite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tony blair will once again meet bush despite opposition .
however , as the crowds prepared to swarm on the capital , the prime minister insisted on tuesday that he stood by the decision to invite president bush to britain .
“ this is the right moment for us to stand firm with the united states in defeating terrorism , wherever it is , and delivering us safely from what i genuinely believe to be the security threat of the 21st century , ” he said . polls show a divided nation despite the prospect of massive public protests , the opinion of the british people as a whole is hard to gauge .
in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .
the same poll showed that more than half of labour party supporters questioned -lrb- 51 percent -rrb- approved of the visit , against 34 percent who would prefer the president to stay away .

eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .
as in the case of france , schreyer considers the measures " intelligent , decisive and balanced , " she told the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has also backed solbes in the matter .
germany 's government should stop blaming the commission for its own mistakes and instead try to solve them , matthias wissman , the cdu 's economic expert , said .
the government 's failure to bring the deficit in line with pact requirements threatens economic stability within the eu , wissmann added .
like wissmann , germany 's federal bank also called on the government to avoid a third violation of the pact in 2004 .
finance ministers have the last word should the commission recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers still have to approve them .

eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .
as in the case of france , schreyer considers the measures " intelligent , decisive and balanced , " she told the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has also backed solbes in the matter .
germany 's government should stop blaming the commission for its own mistakes and instead try to solve them , matthias wissman , the cdu 's economic expert , said .
the government 's failure to bring the deficit in line with pact requirements threatens economic stability within the eu , wissmann added .
like wissmann , germany 's federal bank also called on the government to avoid a third violation of the pact in 2004 .
finance ministers have the last word should the commission recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers still have to approve them .

tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .
but the ministers clashed over iran 's nuclear program . just as the ministers showed the first tentative signs of reconciliation after the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , the next can of worms popped open and out sprang iran .
the issue of iran 's nuclear program took center stage at the foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels , as u.s. secretary of state colin powell said the eu was n't being tough enough with teheran , which washington suspects of trying to develop atomic weapons . powell made the comments after talks with eu foreign ministers on tuesday in brussels , where the u.s. secretary of state and his european counterparts had come together in the hopes of putting their acrimonious divisions over iraq behind them . after what power described as " very candid discussions " with his eu counterparts , he told a news conference that the wording of a document put forward by britain , france and germany was not strong enough when it comes to iran 's non-compliance with its nuclear proliferation treaty obligations . powell said iran seemed to be moving in the right direction in cooperating with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , but that the u.s. had reservations about a draft resolution put forward by the three major eu powers . " we 'll be in discussion with our eu colleagues and other members of the iaea as to whether or not the resolution is strong enough to convey to the world the difficulties we 've had with iran over the years , " powell told reporters . nuclear weapons in iran ? the u.s. says iran 's past actions regarding inspections of its nuclear program - iran admits to having failed to disclose uranium enrichment activities and plants - indicates it is working towards developing nuclear arms .
american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and possibly impose sanctions through the u.n. security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward power generation and is civilian in nature . tuesday 's difference of opinion was foreshadowed on monday , when javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , said that teheran had been forthcoming with the iaea 's investigation .
he made the remarks after meeting with the head of iran 's national security council , hasan rowhani , who said iran would sign another protocol from the iaea which would authorize more checks of its nuclear program . " we have achieved agreements with them , we hope that they will comply with those agreements , " solana said .
" i think that ... they have been honest . " " i would n't have gone that far , " powell said on monday after hearing solana 's comments . time to make up powell spent one day in brussels before leaving to join president george w. bush in london , where he is beginning a state visit .
at the start of the eu meeting , powell stressed the common ground that europe and the u.s. share . " time and again , the values and interests that bind europe and america have proven stronger than the issues that from time to time divide us , " powell said in a ceremony before the meeting , where he unveiled a plaque commemorating 50 years of diplomatic representation to the eu and its forerunners .
the was a mood of conciliation in the air after the month of bitter division over iraq .
belgian foreign minister louis michel , whose country was one of the fiercest opponents of the u.s.-led military action , said it was time for cooperation . " we are beyond worrying about who was right and who was wrong , " he said before the meeting .

tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .
but the ministers clashed over iran 's nuclear program . just as the ministers showed the first tentative signs of reconciliation after the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , the next can of worms popped open and out sprang iran .
the issue of iran 's nuclear program took center stage at the foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels , as u.s. secretary of state colin powell said the eu was n't being tough enough with teheran , which washington suspects of trying to develop atomic weapons . powell made the comments after talks with eu foreign ministers on tuesday in brussels , where the u.s. secretary of state and his european counterparts had come together in the hopes of putting their acrimonious divisions over iraq behind them . after what power described as " very candid discussions " with his eu counterparts , he told a news conference that the wording of a document put forward by britain , france and germany was not strong enough when it comes to iran 's non-compliance with its nuclear proliferation treaty obligations . powell said iran seemed to be moving in the right direction in cooperating with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , but that the u.s. had reservations about a draft resolution put forward by the three major eu powers . " we 'll be in discussion with our eu colleagues and other members of the iaea as to whether or not the resolution is strong enough to convey to the world the difficulties we 've had with iran over the years , " powell told reporters . nuclear weapons in iran ? the u.s. says iran 's past actions regarding inspections of its nuclear program - iran admits to having failed to disclose uranium enrichment activities and plants - indicates it is working towards developing nuclear arms .
american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and possibly impose sanctions through the u.n. security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward power generation and is civilian in nature . tuesday 's difference of opinion was foreshadowed on monday , when javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , said that teheran had been forthcoming with the iaea 's investigation .
he made the remarks after meeting with the head of iran 's national security council , hasan rowhani , who said iran would sign another protocol from the iaea which would authorize more checks of its nuclear program . " we have achieved agreements with them , we hope that they will comply with those agreements , " solana said .
" i think that ... they have been honest . " " i would n't have gone that far , " powell said on monday after hearing solana 's comments . time to make up powell spent one day in brussels before leaving to join president george w. bush in london , where he is beginning a state visit .
at the start of the eu meeting , powell stressed the common ground that europe and the u.s. share . " time and again , the values and interests that bind europe and america have proven stronger than the issues that from time to time divide us , " powell said in a ceremony before the meeting , where he unveiled a plaque commemorating 50 years of diplomatic representation to the eu and its forerunners .

belgian foreign minister louis michel , whose country was one of the fiercest opponents of the u.s.-led military action , said it was time for cooperation . " we are beyond worrying about who was right and who was wrong , " he said before the meeting .

britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and u.s. treasury secretary john snow announced on tuesday that the row over steel tariffs would not stop the two countries forging a new trade partnership . in a speech held just hours before president george w. bush flies into britain for a three-day state visit , british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and his american counterpart , treasury secretary john snow , have pledged to work together to defuse mounting tensions over a possible trade war .
with the specter of washington ’ s decision to impose tariffs on steel imports into the u.s. looming over the president ’ s scheduled talks with prime minister tony blair later this week , brown warned of a possible retaliatory trade conflict between the u.s. and the eu that could cut economic growth in europe and limit job creation .
“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”
no tit-for-tat war " it would be extremely unfortunate if we got to a tit-for-tat protectionist war between trading partners that should recognize the benefits of our working together . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .

britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and u.s. treasury secretary john snow announced on tuesday that the row over steel tariffs would not stop the two countries forging a new trade partnership . in a speech held just hours before president george w. bush flies into britain for a three-day state visit , british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and his american counterpart , treasury secretary john snow , have pledged to work together to defuse mounting tensions over a possible trade war .
with the specter of washington ’ s decision to impose tariffs on steel imports into the u.s. looming over the president ’ s scheduled talks with prime minister tony blair later this week , brown warned of a possible retaliatory trade conflict between the u.s. and the eu that could cut economic growth in europe and limit job creation .
“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”
no tit-for-tat war " it would be extremely unfortunate if we got to a tit-for-tat protectionist war between trading partners that should recognize the benefits of our working together . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .

“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”
no tit-for-tat war " it would be extremely unfortunate if we got to a tit-for-tat protectionist war between trading partners that should recognize the benefits of our working together . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .
in remarks that seemed directed at britain 's soon-to-arrive guest , george w. bush , brown then added : “ with shared values we must also meet a shared threat .
as tony blair said yesterday -lrb- monday -rrb- , it has fallen to this generation - the generation who were born or grew up at a time when britain and america had together fought world war ii - to fight global terrorism and rogue states . ”

echoing brown ’ s statements that britain and the u.s. share a common belief in liberty and opportunity , the work ethic and enterprise , and a commitment to openness rather than isolationism , u.s. trade secretary snow told the conference that he had " thrown cold water " on the idea of a trade war .
but while gordon brown had subtly disguised his eu rebuke , john snow delivered a message that was loud and clear .
while addressing the subject of the america 's recovering economy and u.k. economic growth , snow turned his eyes to europe and the far east . " as we look at the global economy today , it is hard to escape the conclusion that growth has been far too uneven - particularly in the largest industrial nations , " he said . he added : " britain has demonstrated consistent growth , but the other major world economies - particularly japan , germany and france , are operating well below their potential .

the construction of the west bank barrier and europe 's perceived latent anti-semitism are major discussion points . europe 's foreign ministers demanded tuesday that prime minister ariel sharon stop the construction of the west bank barrier at a time when eu-israeli relations are going through a rough period .
the statement followed a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels in which israeli foreign minister silvan shalom took part .
the ministers , who threw their support behind an oct .
21 un resolution condeming the barrier , said the two-state solution to the intifada was now physically impossible because of the barrier .
prime minister ariel sharon , in rome for a two-day visit with close european ally silvio berlusconi , did n't respond to the declaration .
the right-wing israeli leader , speaking to jewish leaders before his visit last week , said that foreign criticism of israeli policy in the palestinian territories stemmed from an anti-semitism that denied israel 's " birthright to exist , " according to wire services .
his office said sharon hoped berlusconi , who 's country currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the european union , will lobby for israel .
" -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- is a staunch fighter against anti-semitism and therefore i think he will be open to our complaints and also to action that can be taken in europe to stop this , " government spokesman raanan gissin told reuters .
foreign minister shalom called on monday for an eu minister 's council that focuses specifically on rooting out and defeating anti-semitism .
heightened suspicion in recent weeks the comments come at a time of acute tension in an israeli-eu relationship that has never been completely harmonious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian leader yasser arafat a deep-seeded belief that europe takes the palestinians ' side in the middle east has often meant sharon 's government does n't take the eu seriously as a negotiating partner .
in addition , the ghost of anti-semitism , which europe has been trying unsuccessfully to shake off , has reared its ugly head in recent weeks .
an eu poll earlier this month showing that europeans believe israel is the greatest threat to world peace further heightened tensions .
embarassing comments by a german parliamentarian describing jews as a " race of perpetrators " and a firebomb attack on a jewish school in a paris suburb over the weekend have weakened europe 's position that it is cracking down on anti-semitism .
anti-israeli sentiment has lead to an imbalance in the way the eu handles the israeli-palestinian conflict , said a government spokesman ahead of sharon 's visit .
" there needs to be a more balanced european policy to israel if they want to play a more constructive role , " gissin said referring to europe 's interest in participating in the middle east peace negotiations .
israel will stop boycott of eu diplomat eu officials view the sharon government 's palestinian policy as heavy-handed , leading to the united nations resolution condeming the construction of the west bank barrier .
brussels is also miffed that sharon has refused to meet eu envoy marc otte because the belgian diplomat met with yassir arafat in september .
diplomats on both sides said they are trying to smooth out the eu-israel spat .
shalom said foreign ministry officials will meet with otte and break the boycott .
he said the eu is willing to change negative perceptions .
" europeans are ready to go the distance to bring about a change in the tone of their politics , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israeli foreign minister visits germany , defends security fence a day after the un passed a resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a security fence , israel 's foreign minister made his first visit to germany and defended his country 's right to security .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's four seasons a really -lrb- really , really -rrb- old fashioned christmas ginger and spice and all things nice nuremberg , city of angels wine to set you glowing visit germany -pipe- 18.11.2003 day tripping from munich to ski paradise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do not try this at home : top german skier sven hannawald at the zugspitze , near munich .
what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .
and if you 're willing to turn in late , you can still make it back to munich by bedtime . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links info on spitzingsee skiing , some in english information on ski rentals , courses , transportation , etc .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .
and if you 're willing to turn in late , you can still make it back to munich by bedtime . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links info on spitzingsee skiing , some in english information on ski rentals , courses , transportation , etc .

it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .
and if you 're willing to turn in late , you can still make it back to munich by bedtime . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links info on spitzingsee skiing , some in english information on ski rentals , courses , transportation , etc .

the construction of the west bank barrier and europe 's perceived latent anti-semitism are major discussion points . europe 's foreign ministers demanded tuesday that prime minister ariel sharon stop the construction of the west bank barrier at a time when eu-israeli relations are going through a rough period .
the statement followed a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels in which israeli foreign minister silvan shalom took part .
the ministers , who threw their support behind an oct .
21 un resolution condeming the barrier , said the two-state solution to the intifada was now physically impossible because of the barrier .
prime minister ariel sharon , in rome for a two-day visit with close european ally silvio berlusconi , did n't respond to the declaration .
the right-wing israeli leader , speaking to jewish leaders before his visit last week , said that foreign criticism of israeli policy in the palestinian territories stemmed from an anti-semitism that denied israel 's " birthright to exist , " according to wire services .
his office said sharon hoped berlusconi , who 's country currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the european union , will lobby for israel .
" -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- is a staunch fighter against anti-semitism and therefore i think he will be open to our complaints and also to action that can be taken in europe to stop this , " government spokesman raanan gissin told reuters .
foreign minister shalom called on monday for an eu minister 's council that focuses specifically on rooting out and defeating anti-semitism .
heightened suspicion in recent weeks the comments come at a time of acute tension in an israeli-eu relationship that has never been completely harmonious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian leader yasser arafat a deep-seeded belief that europe takes the palestinians ' side in the middle east has often meant sharon 's government does n't take the eu seriously as a negotiating partner .
in addition , the ghost of anti-semitism , which europe has been trying unsuccessfully to shake off , has reared its ugly head in recent weeks .
an eu poll earlier this month showing that europeans believe israel is the greatest threat to world peace further heightened tensions .
embarassing comments by a german parliamentarian describing jews as a " race of perpetrators " and a firebomb attack on a jewish school in a paris suburb over the weekend have weakened europe 's position that it is cracking down on anti-semitism .
anti-israeli sentiment has lead to an imbalance in the way the eu handles the israeli-palestinian conflict , said a government spokesman ahead of sharon 's visit .
" there needs to be a more balanced european policy to israel if they want to play a more constructive role , " gissin said referring to europe 's interest in participating in the middle east peace negotiations .
israel will stop boycott of eu diplomat eu officials view the sharon government 's palestinian policy as heavy-handed , leading to the united nations resolution condeming the construction of the west bank barrier .
brussels is also miffed that sharon has refused to meet eu envoy marc otte because the belgian diplomat met with yassir arafat in september .
diplomats on both sides said they are trying to smooth out the eu-israel spat .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .
and if you 're willing to turn in late , you can still make it back to munich by bedtime . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links info on spitzingsee skiing , some in english information on ski rentals , courses , transportation , etc .

' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's four seasons a really -lrb- really , really -rrb- old fashioned christmas ginger and spice and all things nice nuremberg , city of angels wine to set you glowing visit germany -pipe- 18.11.2003 day tripping from munich to ski paradise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do not try this at home : top german skier sven hannawald at the zugspitze , near munich .
what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .
and if you 're willing to turn in late , you can still make it back to munich by bedtime . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links info on spitzingsee skiing , some in english information on ski rentals , courses , transportation , etc .

security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .
president to be toppled along with displaying over 3,000 “ stop bush ” placards as they march through central london , protestors are set to topple an effigy of president bush in trafalgar square in much the same way as a statue representing iraqi dictator saddam hussein was pulled down by u.s. tanks in baghdad in april .
the metropolitan police have hired about 250 mini-vans to ship officers equipped with body-length riot shields , cs gas and batons to the scene if the protests turn violent . blair defends invite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tony blair will once again meet bush despite opposition .
however , as the crowds prepared to swarm on the capital , the prime minister insisted on tuesday that he stood by the decision to invite president bush to britain .
“ this is the right moment for us to stand firm with the united states in defeating terrorism , wherever it is , and delivering us safely from what i genuinely believe to be the security threat of the 21st century , ” he said . polls show a divided nation despite the prospect of massive public protests , the opinion of the british people as a whole is hard to gauge .
in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .
the same poll showed that more than half of labour party supporters questioned -lrb- 51 percent -rrb- approved of the visit , against 34 percent who would prefer the president to stay away .
the security bill for the president ’ s visit is expected to cost britain 's taxpayers in the range of ₤ 4 million .
that 's a hefty $ 6.7 million -lrb- € 5.7 million -rrb- bill for a three-day guest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair tells congress : history will forgive british prime minister tony blair told the u.s. congress on thursday that if no weapons of mass destruction were found in iraq , at least the world was rid of a brutal dictator .

but the ministers clashed over iran 's nuclear program . just as the ministers showed the first tentative signs of reconciliation after the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , the next can of worms popped open and out sprang iran .
the issue of iran 's nuclear program took center stage at the foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels , as u.s. secretary of state colin powell said the eu was n't being tough enough with teheran , which washington suspects of trying to develop atomic weapons . powell made the comments after talks with eu foreign ministers on tuesday in brussels , where the u.s. secretary of state and his european counterparts had come together in the hopes of putting their acrimonious divisions over iraq behind them . after what power described as " very candid discussions " with his eu counterparts , he told a news conference that the wording of a document put forward by britain , france and germany was not strong enough when it comes to iran 's non-compliance with its nuclear proliferation treaty obligations . powell said iran seemed to be moving in the right direction in cooperating with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n.

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.11.2003 eu steps up pressure on germany to cut deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedro solbes , right , plans to get tough on hans eichel .
eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .
as in the case of france , schreyer considers the measures " intelligent , decisive and balanced , " she told the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has also backed solbes in the matter .
germany 's government should stop blaming the commission for its own mistakes and instead try to solve them , matthias wissman , the cdu 's economic expert , said .
the government 's failure to bring the deficit in line with pact requirements threatens economic stability within the eu , wissmann added .
like wissmann , germany 's federal bank also called on the government to avoid a third violation of the pact in 2004 .
finance ministers have the last word should the commission recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers still have to approve them .
smaller countries such as austria and the netherlands , who have managed to keep their budget within the limits of the pact , oppose special treatment for germany or france . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu may force germany to trim the deficit a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact .

the issue of iran 's nuclear program took center stage at the foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels , as u.s. secretary of state colin powell said the eu was n't being tough enough with teheran , which washington suspects of trying to develop atomic weapons . powell made the comments after talks with eu foreign ministers on tuesday in brussels , where the u.s. secretary of state and his european counterparts had come together in the hopes of putting their acrimonious divisions over iraq behind them . after what power described as " very candid discussions " with his eu counterparts , he told a news conference that the wording of a document put forward by britain , france and germany was not strong enough when it comes to iran 's non-compliance with its nuclear proliferation treaty obligations . powell said iran seemed to be moving in the right direction in cooperating with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , but that the u.s. had reservations about a draft resolution put forward by the three major eu powers . " we 'll be in discussion with our eu colleagues and other members of the iaea as to whether or not the resolution is strong enough to convey to the world the difficulties we 've had with iran over the years , " powell told reporters . nuclear weapons in iran ? the u.s. says iran 's past actions regarding inspections of its nuclear program - iran admits to having failed to disclose uranium enrichment activities and plants - indicates it is working towards developing nuclear arms .
american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and possibly impose sanctions through the u.n. security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward power generation and is civilian in nature . tuesday 's difference of opinion was foreshadowed on monday , when javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , said that teheran had been forthcoming with the iaea 's investigation .
he made the remarks after meeting with the head of iran 's national security council , hasan rowhani , who said iran would sign another protocol from the iaea which would authorize more checks of its nuclear program . " we have achieved agreements with them , we hope that they will comply with those agreements , " solana said .
" i think that ... they have been honest . " " i would n't have gone that far , " powell said on monday after hearing solana 's comments . time to make up powell spent one day in brussels before leaving to join president george w. bush in london , where he is beginning a state visit .
at the start of the eu meeting , powell stressed the common ground that europe and the u.s. share . " time and again , the values and interests that bind europe and america have proven stronger than the issues that from time to time divide us , " powell said in a ceremony before the meeting , where he unveiled a plaque commemorating 50 years of diplomatic representation to the eu and its forerunners .
the was a mood of conciliation in the air after the month of bitter division over iraq .
belgian foreign minister louis michel , whose country was one of the fiercest opponents of the u.s.-led military action , said it was time for cooperation . " we are beyond worrying about who was right and who was wrong , " he said before the meeting .

britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and u.s. treasury secretary john snow announced on tuesday that the row over steel tariffs would not stop the two countries forging a new trade partnership . in a speech held just hours before president george w. bush flies into britain for a three-day state visit , british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and his american counterpart , treasury secretary john snow , have pledged to work together to defuse mounting tensions over a possible trade war .
with the specter of washington ’ s decision to impose tariffs on steel imports into the u.s. looming over the president ’ s scheduled talks with prime minister tony blair later this week , brown warned of a possible retaliatory trade conflict between the u.s. and the eu that could cut economic growth in europe and limit job creation .
“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”
no tit-for-tat war " it would be extremely unfortunate if we got to a tit-for-tat protectionist war between trading partners that should recognize the benefits of our working together . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .
in remarks that seemed directed at britain 's soon-to-arrive guest , george w. bush , brown then added : “ with shared values we must also meet a shared threat .
as tony blair said yesterday -lrb- monday -rrb- , it has fallen to this generation - the generation who were born or grew up at a time when britain and america had together fought world war ii - to fight global terrorism and rogue states . ”

echoing brown ’ s statements that britain and the u.s. share a common belief in liberty and opportunity , the work ethic and enterprise , and a commitment to openness rather than isolationism , u.s. trade secretary snow told the conference that he had " thrown cold water " on the idea of a trade war .
but while gordon brown had subtly disguised his eu rebuke , john snow delivered a message that was loud and clear .
while addressing the subject of the america 's recovering economy and u.k. economic growth , snow turned his eyes to europe and the far east . " as we look at the global economy today , it is hard to escape the conclusion that growth has been far too uneven - particularly in the largest industrial nations , " he said . he added : " britain has demonstrated consistent growth , but the other major world economies - particularly japan , germany and france , are operating well below their potential .

britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and u.s. treasury secretary john snow announced on tuesday that the row over steel tariffs would not stop the two countries forging a new trade partnership . in a speech held just hours before president george w. bush flies into britain for a three-day state visit , british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and his american counterpart , treasury secretary john snow , have pledged to work together to defuse mounting tensions over a possible trade war .
with the specter of washington ’ s decision to impose tariffs on steel imports into the u.s. looming over the president ’ s scheduled talks with prime minister tony blair later this week , brown warned of a possible retaliatory trade conflict between the u.s. and the eu that could cut economic growth in europe and limit job creation .
“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”
no tit-for-tat war " it would be extremely unfortunate if we got to a tit-for-tat protectionist war between trading partners that should recognize the benefits of our working together . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .
in remarks that seemed directed at britain 's soon-to-arrive guest , george w. bush , brown then added : “ with shared values we must also meet a shared threat .
as tony blair said yesterday -lrb- monday -rrb- , it has fallen to this generation - the generation who were born or grew up at a time when britain and america had together fought world war ii - to fight global terrorism and rogue states . ”
snow says smoldering trade row extinguished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. treasury secretary john snow .
echoing brown ’ s statements that britain and the u.s. share a common belief in liberty and opportunity , the work ethic and enterprise , and a commitment to openness rather than isolationism , u.s. trade secretary snow told the conference that he had " thrown cold water " on the idea of a trade war .
but while gordon brown had subtly disguised his eu rebuke , john snow delivered a message that was loud and clear .

eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .
as in the case of france , schreyer considers the measures " intelligent , decisive and balanced , " she told the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has also backed solbes in the matter .
germany 's government should stop blaming the commission for its own mistakes and instead try to solve them , matthias wissman , the cdu 's economic expert , said .
the government 's failure to bring the deficit in line with pact requirements threatens economic stability within the eu , wissmann added .
like wissmann , germany 's federal bank also called on the government to avoid a third violation of the pact in 2004 .
finance ministers have the last word should the commission recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers still have to approve them .

eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .

britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and u.s. treasury secretary john snow announced on tuesday that the row over steel tariffs would not stop the two countries forging a new trade partnership . in a speech held just hours before president george w. bush flies into britain for a three-day state visit , british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and his american counterpart , treasury secretary john snow , have pledged to work together to defuse mounting tensions over a possible trade war .
with the specter of washington ’ s decision to impose tariffs on steel imports into the u.s. looming over the president ’ s scheduled talks with prime minister tony blair later this week , brown warned of a possible retaliatory trade conflict between the u.s. and the eu that could cut economic growth in europe and limit job creation .
“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”
no tit-for-tat war " it would be extremely unfortunate if we got to a tit-for-tat protectionist war between trading partners that should recognize the benefits of our working together . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .
in remarks that seemed directed at britain 's soon-to-arrive guest , george w. bush , brown then added : “ with shared values we must also meet a shared threat .
as tony blair said yesterday -lrb- monday -rrb- , it has fallen to this generation - the generation who were born or grew up at a time when britain and america had together fought world war ii - to fight global terrorism and rogue states . ”
snow says smoldering trade row extinguished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. treasury secretary john snow .
echoing brown ’ s statements that britain and the u.s. share a common belief in liberty and opportunity , the work ethic and enterprise , and a commitment to openness rather than isolationism , u.s. trade secretary snow told the conference that he had " thrown cold water " on the idea of a trade war .
but while gordon brown had subtly disguised his eu rebuke , john snow delivered a message that was loud and clear .
while addressing the subject of the america 's recovering economy and u.k. economic growth , snow turned his eyes to europe and the far east . " as we look at the global economy today , it is hard to escape the conclusion that growth has been far too uneven - particularly in the largest industrial nations , " he said . he added : " britain has demonstrated consistent growth , but the other major world economies - particularly japan , germany and france , are operating well below their potential .

security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .
president to be toppled along with displaying over 3,000 “ stop bush ” placards as they march through central london , protestors are set to topple an effigy of president bush in trafalgar square in much the same way as a statue representing iraqi dictator saddam hussein was pulled down by u.s. tanks in baghdad in april .
the metropolitan police have hired about 250 mini-vans to ship officers equipped with body-length riot shields , cs gas and batons to the scene if the protests turn violent . blair defends invite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tony blair will once again meet bush despite opposition .
however , as the crowds prepared to swarm on the capital , the prime minister insisted on tuesday that he stood by the decision to invite president bush to britain .
“ this is the right moment for us to stand firm with the united states in defeating terrorism , wherever it is , and delivering us safely from what i genuinely believe to be the security threat of the 21st century , ” he said . polls show a divided nation despite the prospect of massive public protests , the opinion of the british people as a whole is hard to gauge .
in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .
the same poll showed that more than half of labour party supporters questioned -lrb- 51 percent -rrb- approved of the visit , against 34 percent who would prefer the president to stay away .
the security bill for the president ’ s visit is expected to cost britain 's taxpayers in the range of ₤ 4 million .
that 's a hefty $ 6.7 million -lrb- € 5.7 million -rrb- bill for a three-day guest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair tells congress : history will forgive british prime minister tony blair told the u.s. congress on thursday that if no weapons of mass destruction were found in iraq , at least the world was rid of a brutal dictator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.11.2003 eu steps up pressure on germany to cut deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedro solbes , right , plans to get tough on hans eichel .
eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .
as in the case of france , schreyer considers the measures " intelligent , decisive and balanced , " she told the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has also backed solbes in the matter .
germany 's government should stop blaming the commission for its own mistakes and instead try to solve them , matthias wissman , the cdu 's economic expert , said .
the government 's failure to bring the deficit in line with pact requirements threatens economic stability within the eu , wissmann added .
like wissmann , germany 's federal bank also called on the government to avoid a third violation of the pact in 2004 .
finance ministers have the last word should the commission recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers still have to approve them .
smaller countries such as austria and the netherlands , who have managed to keep their budget within the limits of the pact , oppose special treatment for germany or france . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu may force germany to trim the deficit a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact .

the construction of the west bank barrier and europe 's perceived latent anti-semitism are major discussion points . europe 's foreign ministers demanded tuesday that prime minister ariel sharon stop the construction of the west bank barrier at a time when eu-israeli relations are going through a rough period .
the statement followed a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels in which israeli foreign minister silvan shalom took part .
the ministers , who threw their support behind an oct .
21 un resolution condeming the barrier , said the two-state solution to the intifada was now physically impossible because of the barrier .
prime minister ariel sharon , in rome for a two-day visit with close european ally silvio berlusconi , did n't respond to the declaration .
the right-wing israeli leader , speaking to jewish leaders before his visit last week , said that foreign criticism of israeli policy in the palestinian territories stemmed from an anti-semitism that denied israel 's " birthright to exist , " according to wire services .
his office said sharon hoped berlusconi , who 's country currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the european union , will lobby for israel .
" -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- is a staunch fighter against anti-semitism and therefore i think he will be open to our complaints and also to action that can be taken in europe to stop this , " government spokesman raanan gissin told reuters .
foreign minister shalom called on monday for an eu minister 's council that focuses specifically on rooting out and defeating anti-semitism .
heightened suspicion in recent weeks the comments come at a time of acute tension in an israeli-eu relationship that has never been completely harmonious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian leader yasser arafat a deep-seeded belief that europe takes the palestinians ' side in the middle east has often meant sharon 's government does n't take the eu seriously as a negotiating partner .
in addition , the ghost of anti-semitism , which europe has been trying unsuccessfully to shake off , has reared its ugly head in recent weeks .
an eu poll earlier this month showing that europeans believe israel is the greatest threat to world peace further heightened tensions .
embarassing comments by a german parliamentarian describing jews as a " race of perpetrators " and a firebomb attack on a jewish school in a paris suburb over the weekend have weakened europe 's position that it is cracking down on anti-semitism .
anti-israeli sentiment has lead to an imbalance in the way the eu handles the israeli-palestinian conflict , said a government spokesman ahead of sharon 's visit .
" there needs to be a more balanced european policy to israel if they want to play a more constructive role , " gissin said referring to europe 's interest in participating in the middle east peace negotiations .
israel will stop boycott of eu diplomat eu officials view the sharon government 's palestinian policy as heavy-handed , leading to the united nations resolution condeming the construction of the west bank barrier .
brussels is also miffed that sharon has refused to meet eu envoy marc otte because the belgian diplomat met with yassir arafat in september .
diplomats on both sides said they are trying to smooth out the eu-israel spat .
shalom said foreign ministry officials will meet with otte and break the boycott .
he said the eu is willing to change negative perceptions .
" europeans are ready to go the distance to bring about a change in the tone of their politics , " he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de israeli foreign minister visits germany , defends security fence a day after the un passed a resolution calling on israel to stop the construction of a security fence , israel 's foreign minister made his first visit to germany and defended his country 's right to security .

the construction of the west bank barrier and europe 's perceived latent anti-semitism are major discussion points . europe 's foreign ministers demanded tuesday that prime minister ariel sharon stop the construction of the west bank barrier at a time when eu-israeli relations are going through a rough period .
the statement followed a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels in which israeli foreign minister silvan shalom took part .

prime minister ariel sharon , in rome for a two-day visit with close european ally silvio berlusconi , did n't respond to the declaration .
the right-wing israeli leader , speaking to jewish leaders before his visit last week , said that foreign criticism of israeli policy in the palestinian territories stemmed from an anti-semitism that denied israel 's " birthright to exist , " according to wire services .
his office said sharon hoped berlusconi , who 's country currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the european union , will lobby for israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's four seasons a really -lrb- really , really -rrb- old fashioned christmas ginger and spice and all things nice nuremberg , city of angels wine to set you glowing visit germany -pipe- 18.11.2003 day tripping from munich to ski paradise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do not try this at home : top german skier sven hannawald at the zugspitze , near munich .
what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .
and if you 're willing to turn in late , you can still make it back to munich by bedtime . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links info on spitzingsee skiing , some in english information on ski rentals , courses , transportation , etc .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .
and if you 're willing to turn in late , you can still make it back to munich by bedtime . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links info on spitzingsee skiing , some in english information on ski rentals , courses , transportation , etc .

the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .

eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .
as in the case of france , schreyer considers the measures " intelligent , decisive and balanced , " she told the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has also backed solbes in the matter .
germany 's government should stop blaming the commission for its own mistakes and instead try to solve them , matthias wissman , the cdu 's economic expert , said .
the government 's failure to bring the deficit in line with pact requirements threatens economic stability within the eu , wissmann added .
like wissmann , germany 's federal bank also called on the government to avoid a third violation of the pact in 2004 .
finance ministers have the last word should the commission recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers still have to approve them .

the construction of the west bank barrier and europe 's perceived latent anti-semitism are major discussion points . europe 's foreign ministers demanded tuesday that prime minister ariel sharon stop the construction of the west bank barrier at a time when eu-israeli relations are going through a rough period .
the statement followed a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels in which israeli foreign minister silvan shalom took part .
the ministers , who threw their support behind an oct .
21 un resolution condeming the barrier , said the two-state solution to the intifada was now physically impossible because of the barrier .
prime minister ariel sharon , in rome for a two-day visit with close european ally silvio berlusconi , did n't respond to the declaration .
the right-wing israeli leader , speaking to jewish leaders before his visit last week , said that foreign criticism of israeli policy in the palestinian territories stemmed from an anti-semitism that denied israel 's " birthright to exist , " according to wire services .
his office said sharon hoped berlusconi , who 's country currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the european union , will lobby for israel .
" -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- is a staunch fighter against anti-semitism and therefore i think he will be open to our complaints and also to action that can be taken in europe to stop this , " government spokesman raanan gissin told reuters .
foreign minister shalom called on monday for an eu minister 's council that focuses specifically on rooting out and defeating anti-semitism .

an eu poll earlier this month showing that europeans believe israel is the greatest threat to world peace further heightened tensions .
embarassing comments by a german parliamentarian describing jews as a " race of perpetrators " and a firebomb attack on a jewish school in a paris suburb over the weekend have weakened europe 's position that it is cracking down on anti-semitism .
anti-israeli sentiment has lead to an imbalance in the way the eu handles the israeli-palestinian conflict , said a government spokesman ahead of sharon 's visit .
" there needs to be a more balanced european policy to israel if they want to play a more constructive role , " gissin said referring to europe 's interest in participating in the middle east peace negotiations .
israel will stop boycott of eu diplomat eu officials view the sharon government 's palestinian policy as heavy-handed , leading to the united nations resolution condeming the construction of the west bank barrier .

with the specter of washington ’ s decision to impose tariffs on steel imports into the u.s. looming over the president ’ s scheduled talks with prime minister tony blair later this week , brown warned of a possible retaliatory trade conflict between the u.s. and the eu that could cut economic growth in europe and limit job creation .
“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”
no tit-for-tat war " it would be extremely unfortunate if we got to a tit-for-tat protectionist war between trading partners that should recognize the benefits of our working together . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .
in remarks that seemed directed at britain 's soon-to-arrive guest , george w. bush , brown then added : “ with shared values we must also meet a shared threat .
as tony blair said yesterday -lrb- monday -rrb- , it has fallen to this generation - the generation who were born or grew up at a time when britain and america had together fought world war ii - to fight global terrorism and rogue states . ”

but while gordon brown had subtly disguised his eu rebuke , john snow delivered a message that was loud and clear .
while addressing the subject of the america 's recovering economy and u.k. economic growth , snow turned his eyes to europe and the far east .

britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and u.s. treasury secretary john snow announced on tuesday that the row over steel tariffs would not stop the two countries forging a new trade partnership . in a speech held just hours before president george w. bush flies into britain for a three-day state visit , british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and his american counterpart , treasury secretary john snow , have pledged to work together to defuse mounting tensions over a possible trade war .
with the specter of washington ’ s decision to impose tariffs on steel imports into the u.s. looming over the president ’ s scheduled talks with prime minister tony blair later this week , brown warned of a possible retaliatory trade conflict between the u.s. and the eu that could cut economic growth in europe and limit job creation .
“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”
no tit-for-tat war " it would be extremely unfortunate if we got to a tit-for-tat protectionist war between trading partners that should recognize the benefits of our working together . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .
in remarks that seemed directed at britain 's soon-to-arrive guest , george w. bush , brown then added : “ with shared values we must also meet a shared threat .
as tony blair said yesterday -lrb- monday -rrb- , it has fallen to this generation - the generation who were born or grew up at a time when britain and america had together fought world war ii - to fight global terrorism and rogue states . ”
snow says smoldering trade row extinguished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. treasury secretary john snow .
echoing brown ’ s statements that britain and the u.s. share a common belief in liberty and opportunity , the work ethic and enterprise , and a commitment to openness rather than isolationism , u.s. trade secretary snow told the conference that he had " thrown cold water " on the idea of a trade war .
but while gordon brown had subtly disguised his eu rebuke , john snow delivered a message that was loud and clear .
while addressing the subject of the america 's recovering economy and u.k. economic growth , snow turned his eyes to europe and the far east . " as we look at the global economy today , it is hard to escape the conclusion that growth has been far too uneven - particularly in the largest industrial nations , " he said . he added : " britain has demonstrated consistent growth , but the other major world economies - particularly japan , germany and france , are operating well below their potential .

tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .
but the ministers clashed over iran 's nuclear program . just as the ministers showed the first tentative signs of reconciliation after the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , the next can of worms popped open and out sprang iran .
the issue of iran 's nuclear program took center stage at the foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels , as u.s. secretary of state colin powell said the eu was n't being tough enough with teheran , which washington suspects of trying to develop atomic weapons . powell made the comments after talks with eu foreign ministers on tuesday in brussels , where the u.s. secretary of state and his european counterparts had come together in the hopes of putting their acrimonious divisions over iraq behind them . after what power described as " very candid discussions " with his eu counterparts , he told a news conference that the wording of a document put forward by britain , france and germany was not strong enough when it comes to iran 's non-compliance with its nuclear proliferation treaty obligations . powell said iran seemed to be moving in the right direction in cooperating with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n.

american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and possibly impose sanctions through the u.n. security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward power generation and is civilian in nature . tuesday 's difference of opinion was foreshadowed on monday , when javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , said that teheran had been forthcoming with the iaea 's investigation .
he made the remarks after meeting with the head of iran 's national security council , hasan rowhani , who said iran would sign another protocol from the iaea which would authorize more checks of its nuclear program . " we have achieved agreements with them , we hope that they will comply with those agreements , " solana said .
" i think that ... they have been honest . " " i would n't have gone that far , " powell said on monday after hearing solana 's comments . time to make up powell spent one day in brussels before leaving to join president george w. bush in london , where he is beginning a state visit .
at the start of the eu meeting , powell stressed the common ground that europe and the u.s. share .

tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .
but the ministers clashed over iran 's nuclear program . just as the ministers showed the first tentative signs of reconciliation after the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , the next can of worms popped open and out sprang iran .
the issue of iran 's nuclear program took center stage at the foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels , as u.s. secretary of state colin powell said the eu was n't being tough enough with teheran , which washington suspects of trying to develop atomic weapons . powell made the comments after talks with eu foreign ministers on tuesday in brussels , where the u.s. secretary of state and his european counterparts had come together in the hopes of putting their acrimonious divisions over iraq behind them . after what power described as " very candid discussions " with his eu counterparts , he told a news conference that the wording of a document put forward by britain , france and germany was not strong enough when it comes to iran 's non-compliance with its nuclear proliferation treaty obligations . powell said iran seemed to be moving in the right direction in cooperating with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , but that the u.s. had reservations about a draft resolution put forward by the three major eu powers . " we 'll be in discussion with our eu colleagues and other members of the iaea as to whether or not the resolution is strong enough to convey to the world the difficulties we 've had with iran over the years , " powell told reporters . nuclear weapons in iran ? the u.s. says iran 's past actions regarding inspections of its nuclear program - iran admits to having failed to disclose uranium enrichment activities and plants - indicates it is working towards developing nuclear arms .
american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and possibly impose sanctions through the u.n. security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward power generation and is civilian in nature . tuesday 's difference of opinion was foreshadowed on monday , when javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , said that teheran had been forthcoming with the iaea 's investigation .
he made the remarks after meeting with the head of iran 's national security council , hasan rowhani , who said iran would sign another protocol from the iaea which would authorize more checks of its nuclear program . " we have achieved agreements with them , we hope that they will comply with those agreements , " solana said .
" i think that ... they have been honest . " " i would n't have gone that far , " powell said on monday after hearing solana 's comments . time to make up powell spent one day in brussels before leaving to join president george w. bush in london , where he is beginning a state visit .
at the start of the eu meeting , powell stressed the common ground that europe and the u.s. share . " time and again , the values and interests that bind europe and america have proven stronger than the issues that from time to time divide us , " powell said in a ceremony before the meeting , where he unveiled a plaque commemorating 50 years of diplomatic representation to the eu and its forerunners .
the was a mood of conciliation in the air after the month of bitter division over iraq .
belgian foreign minister louis michel , whose country was one of the fiercest opponents of the u.s.-led military action , said it was time for cooperation . " we are beyond worrying about who was right and who was wrong , " he said before the meeting .

security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .
president to be toppled along with displaying over 3,000 “ stop bush ” placards as they march through central london , protestors are set to topple an effigy of president bush in trafalgar square in much the same way as a statue representing iraqi dictator saddam hussein was pulled down by u.s. tanks in baghdad in april .
the metropolitan police have hired about 250 mini-vans to ship officers equipped with body-length riot shields , cs gas and batons to the scene if the protests turn violent . blair defends invite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tony blair will once again meet bush despite opposition .
however , as the crowds prepared to swarm on the capital , the prime minister insisted on tuesday that he stood by the decision to invite president bush to britain .
“ this is the right moment for us to stand firm with the united states in defeating terrorism , wherever it is , and delivering us safely from what i genuinely believe to be the security threat of the 21st century , ” he said . polls show a divided nation despite the prospect of massive public protests , the opinion of the british people as a whole is hard to gauge .
in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .
the same poll showed that more than half of labour party supporters questioned -lrb- 51 percent -rrb- approved of the visit , against 34 percent who would prefer the president to stay away .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : germany 's four seasons a really -lrb- really , really -rrb- old fashioned christmas ginger and spice and all things nice nuremberg , city of angels wine to set you glowing visit germany -pipe- 18.11.2003 day tripping from munich to ski paradise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : do not try this at home : top german skier sven hannawald at the zugspitze , near munich .
what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .
and if you 're willing to turn in late , you can still make it back to munich by bedtime . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links info on spitzingsee skiing , some in english information on ski rentals , courses , transportation , etc .

security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .

in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.11.2003 eu steps up pressure on germany to cut deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedro solbes , right , plans to get tough on hans eichel .
eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .
as in the case of france , schreyer considers the measures " intelligent , decisive and balanced , " she told the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has also backed solbes in the matter .
germany 's government should stop blaming the commission for its own mistakes and instead try to solve them , matthias wissman , the cdu 's economic expert , said .
the government 's failure to bring the deficit in line with pact requirements threatens economic stability within the eu , wissmann added .
like wissmann , germany 's federal bank also called on the government to avoid a third violation of the pact in 2004 .
finance ministers have the last word should the commission recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers still have to approve them .
smaller countries such as austria and the netherlands , who have managed to keep their budget within the limits of the pact , oppose special treatment for germany or france . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu may force germany to trim the deficit a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact .

britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and u.s. treasury secretary john snow announced on tuesday that the row over steel tariffs would not stop the two countries forging a new trade partnership . in a speech held just hours before president george w. bush flies into britain for a three-day state visit , british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and his american counterpart , treasury secretary john snow , have pledged to work together to defuse mounting tensions over a possible trade war .
with the specter of washington ’ s decision to impose tariffs on steel imports into the u.s. looming over the president ’ s scheduled talks with prime minister tony blair later this week , brown warned of a possible retaliatory trade conflict between the u.s. and the eu that could cut economic growth in europe and limit job creation .
“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”
no tit-for-tat war " it would be extremely unfortunate if we got to a tit-for-tat protectionist war between trading partners that should recognize the benefits of our working together . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .
in remarks that seemed directed at britain 's soon-to-arrive guest , george w. bush , brown then added : “ with shared values we must also meet a shared threat .
as tony blair said yesterday -lrb- monday -rrb- , it has fallen to this generation - the generation who were born or grew up at a time when britain and america had together fought world war ii - to fight global terrorism and rogue states . ”
snow says smoldering trade row extinguished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. treasury secretary john snow .
echoing brown ’ s statements that britain and the u.s. share a common belief in liberty and opportunity , the work ethic and enterprise , and a commitment to openness rather than isolationism , u.s. trade secretary snow told the conference that he had " thrown cold water " on the idea of a trade war .
but while gordon brown had subtly disguised his eu rebuke , john snow delivered a message that was loud and clear .
while addressing the subject of the america 's recovering economy and u.k. economic growth , snow turned his eyes to europe and the far east . " as we look at the global economy today , it is hard to escape the conclusion that growth has been far too uneven - particularly in the largest industrial nations , " he said . he added : " britain has demonstrated consistent growth , but the other major world economies - particularly japan , germany and france , are operating well below their potential .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .

eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .

eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .

tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .
but the ministers clashed over iran 's nuclear program . just as the ministers showed the first tentative signs of reconciliation after the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , the next can of worms popped open and out sprang iran .
the issue of iran 's nuclear program took center stage at the foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels , as u.s. secretary of state colin powell said the eu was n't being tough enough with teheran , which washington suspects of trying to develop atomic weapons . powell made the comments after talks with eu foreign ministers on tuesday in brussels , where the u.s. secretary of state and his european counterparts had come together in the hopes of putting their acrimonious divisions over iraq behind them . after what power described as " very candid discussions " with his eu counterparts , he told a news conference that the wording of a document put forward by britain , france and germany was not strong enough when it comes to iran 's non-compliance with its nuclear proliferation treaty obligations . powell said iran seemed to be moving in the right direction in cooperating with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , but that the u.s. had reservations about a draft resolution put forward by the three major eu powers . " we 'll be in discussion with our eu colleagues and other members of the iaea as to whether or not the resolution is strong enough to convey to the world the difficulties we 've had with iran over the years , " powell told reporters . nuclear weapons in iran ? the u.s. says iran 's past actions regarding inspections of its nuclear program - iran admits to having failed to disclose uranium enrichment activities and plants - indicates it is working towards developing nuclear arms .
american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and possibly impose sanctions through the u.n. security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward power generation and is civilian in nature . tuesday 's difference of opinion was foreshadowed on monday , when javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , said that teheran had been forthcoming with the iaea 's investigation .

tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .
but the ministers clashed over iran 's nuclear program . just as the ministers showed the first tentative signs of reconciliation after the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , the next can of worms popped open and out sprang iran .
the issue of iran 's nuclear program took center stage at the foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels , as u.s. secretary of state colin powell said the eu was n't being tough enough with teheran , which washington suspects of trying to develop atomic weapons . powell made the comments after talks with eu foreign ministers on tuesday in brussels , where the u.s. secretary of state and his european counterparts had come together in the hopes of putting their acrimonious divisions over iraq behind them . after what power described as " very candid discussions " with his eu counterparts , he told a news conference that the wording of a document put forward by britain , france and germany was not strong enough when it comes to iran 's non-compliance with its nuclear proliferation treaty obligations . powell said iran seemed to be moving in the right direction in cooperating with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , but that the u.s. had reservations about a draft resolution put forward by the three major eu powers .

security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .
president to be toppled along with displaying over 3,000 “ stop bush ” placards as they march through central london , protestors are set to topple an effigy of president bush in trafalgar square in much the same way as a statue representing iraqi dictator saddam hussein was pulled down by u.s. tanks in baghdad in april .
the metropolitan police have hired about 250 mini-vans to ship officers equipped with body-length riot shields , cs gas and batons to the scene if the protests turn violent . blair defends invite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tony blair will once again meet bush despite opposition .
however , as the crowds prepared to swarm on the capital , the prime minister insisted on tuesday that he stood by the decision to invite president bush to britain .
“ this is the right moment for us to stand firm with the united states in defeating terrorism , wherever it is , and delivering us safely from what i genuinely believe to be the security threat of the 21st century , ” he said . polls show a divided nation despite the prospect of massive public protests , the opinion of the british people as a whole is hard to gauge .
in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .
the same poll showed that more than half of labour party supporters questioned -lrb- 51 percent -rrb- approved of the visit , against 34 percent who would prefer the president to stay away .
the security bill for the president ’ s visit is expected to cost britain 's taxpayers in the range of ₤ 4 million .
that 's a hefty $ 6.7 million -lrb- € 5.7 million -rrb- bill for a three-day guest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair tells congress : history will forgive british prime minister tony blair told the u.s. congress on thursday that if no weapons of mass destruction were found in iraq , at least the world was rid of a brutal dictator .

the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .
president to be toppled along with displaying over 3,000 “ stop bush ” placards as they march through central london , protestors are set to topple an effigy of president bush in trafalgar square in much the same way as a statue representing iraqi dictator saddam hussein was pulled down by u.s. tanks in baghdad in april .
the metropolitan police have hired about 250 mini-vans to ship officers equipped with body-length riot shields , cs gas and batons to the scene if the protests turn violent . blair defends invite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tony blair will once again meet bush despite opposition .
however , as the crowds prepared to swarm on the capital , the prime minister insisted on tuesday that he stood by the decision to invite president bush to britain .
“ this is the right moment for us to stand firm with the united states in defeating terrorism , wherever it is , and delivering us safely from what i genuinely believe to be the security threat of the 21st century , ” he said . polls show a divided nation despite the prospect of massive public protests , the opinion of the british people as a whole is hard to gauge .
in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .
the same poll showed that more than half of labour party supporters questioned -lrb- 51 percent -rrb- approved of the visit , against 34 percent who would prefer the president to stay away .
the security bill for the president ’ s visit is expected to cost britain 's taxpayers in the range of ₤ 4 million .

britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and u.s. treasury secretary john snow announced on tuesday that the row over steel tariffs would not stop the two countries forging a new trade partnership . in a speech held just hours before president george w. bush flies into britain for a three-day state visit , british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and his american counterpart , treasury secretary john snow , have pledged to work together to defuse mounting tensions over a possible trade war .
with the specter of washington ’ s decision to impose tariffs on steel imports into the u.s. looming over the president ’ s scheduled talks with prime minister tony blair later this week , brown warned of a possible retaliatory trade conflict between the u.s. and the eu that could cut economic growth in europe and limit job creation .
“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .
in remarks that seemed directed at britain 's soon-to-arrive guest , george w. bush , brown then added : “ with shared values we must also meet a shared threat .
as tony blair said yesterday -lrb- monday -rrb- , it has fallen to this generation - the generation who were born or grew up at a time when britain and america had together fought world war ii - to fight global terrorism and rogue states . ”
snow says smoldering trade row extinguished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. treasury secretary john snow .
echoing brown ’ s statements that britain and the u.s. share a common belief in liberty and opportunity , the work ethic and enterprise , and a commitment to openness rather than isolationism , u.s. trade secretary snow told the conference that he had " thrown cold water " on the idea of a trade war .
but while gordon brown had subtly disguised his eu rebuke , john snow delivered a message that was loud and clear .
while addressing the subject of the america 's recovering economy and u.k. economic growth , snow turned his eyes to europe and the far east . " as we look at the global economy today , it is hard to escape the conclusion that growth has been far too uneven - particularly in the largest industrial nations , " he said . he added : " britain has demonstrated consistent growth , but the other major world economies - particularly japan , germany and france , are operating well below their potential .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .
and if you 're willing to turn in late , you can still make it back to munich by bedtime . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links info on spitzingsee skiing , some in english information on ski rentals , courses , transportation , etc .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "

britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and u.s. treasury secretary john snow announced on tuesday that the row over steel tariffs would not stop the two countries forging a new trade partnership . in a speech held just hours before president george w. bush flies into britain for a three-day state visit , british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and his american counterpart , treasury secretary john snow , have pledged to work together to defuse mounting tensions over a possible trade war .
with the specter of washington ’ s decision to impose tariffs on steel imports into the u.s. looming over the president ’ s scheduled talks with prime minister tony blair later this week , brown warned of a possible retaliatory trade conflict between the u.s. and the eu that could cut economic growth in europe and limit job creation .
“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”
no tit-for-tat war " it would be extremely unfortunate if we got to a tit-for-tat protectionist war between trading partners that should recognize the benefits of our working together . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .
in remarks that seemed directed at britain 's soon-to-arrive guest , george w. bush , brown then added : “ with shared values we must also meet a shared threat .
as tony blair said yesterday -lrb- monday -rrb- , it has fallen to this generation - the generation who were born or grew up at a time when britain and america had together fought world war ii - to fight global terrorism and rogue states . ”
snow says smoldering trade row extinguished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. treasury secretary john snow .
echoing brown ’ s statements that britain and the u.s. share a common belief in liberty and opportunity , the work ethic and enterprise , and a commitment to openness rather than isolationism , u.s. trade secretary snow told the conference that he had " thrown cold water " on the idea of a trade war .
but while gordon brown had subtly disguised his eu rebuke , john snow delivered a message that was loud and clear .
while addressing the subject of the america 's recovering economy and u.k. economic growth , snow turned his eyes to europe and the far east . " as we look at the global economy today , it is hard to escape the conclusion that growth has been far too uneven - particularly in the largest industrial nations , " he said . he added : " britain has demonstrated consistent growth , but the other major world economies - particularly japan , germany and france , are operating well below their potential .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.11.2003 west bank barrier , anti-semitism cloud israeli leaders ' european visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu diplomats once again condemn the west bank barrier israeli prime minister ariel sharon is in europe at a time of acute tension between the two sides .
the construction of the west bank barrier and europe 's perceived latent anti-semitism are major discussion points . europe 's foreign ministers demanded tuesday that prime minister ariel sharon stop the construction of the west bank barrier at a time when eu-israeli relations are going through a rough period .
the statement followed a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels in which israeli foreign minister silvan shalom took part .
the ministers , who threw their support behind an oct .
21 un resolution condeming the barrier , said the two-state solution to the intifada was now physically impossible because of the barrier .
prime minister ariel sharon , in rome for a two-day visit with close european ally silvio berlusconi , did n't respond to the declaration .
the right-wing israeli leader , speaking to jewish leaders before his visit last week , said that foreign criticism of israeli policy in the palestinian territories stemmed from an anti-semitism that denied israel 's " birthright to exist , " according to wire services .

tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .
but the ministers clashed over iran 's nuclear program . just as the ministers showed the first tentative signs of reconciliation after the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , the next can of worms popped open and out sprang iran .
the issue of iran 's nuclear program took center stage at the foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels , as u.s. secretary of state colin powell said the eu was n't being tough enough with teheran , which washington suspects of trying to develop atomic weapons . powell made the comments after talks with eu foreign ministers on tuesday in brussels , where the u.s. secretary of state and his european counterparts had come together in the hopes of putting their acrimonious divisions over iraq behind them . after what power described as " very candid discussions " with his eu counterparts , he told a news conference that the wording of a document put forward by britain , france and germany was not strong enough when it comes to iran 's non-compliance with its nuclear proliferation treaty obligations . powell said iran seemed to be moving in the right direction in cooperating with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , but that the u.s. had reservations about a draft resolution put forward by the three major eu powers . " we 'll be in discussion with our eu colleagues and other members of the iaea as to whether or not the resolution is strong enough to convey to the world the difficulties we 've had with iran over the years , " powell told reporters . nuclear weapons in iran ? the u.s. says iran 's past actions regarding inspections of its nuclear program - iran admits to having failed to disclose uranium enrichment activities and plants - indicates it is working towards developing nuclear arms .
american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and possibly impose sanctions through the u.n. security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward power generation and is civilian in nature . tuesday 's difference of opinion was foreshadowed on monday , when javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , said that teheran had been forthcoming with the iaea 's investigation .
he made the remarks after meeting with the head of iran 's national security council , hasan rowhani , who said iran would sign another protocol from the iaea which would authorize more checks of its nuclear program . " we have achieved agreements with them , we hope that they will comply with those agreements , " solana said .
" i think that ... they have been honest . " " i would n't have gone that far , " powell said on monday after hearing solana 's comments . time to make up powell spent one day in brussels before leaving to join president george w. bush in london , where he is beginning a state visit .
at the start of the eu meeting , powell stressed the common ground that europe and the u.s. share . " time and again , the values and interests that bind europe and america have proven stronger than the issues that from time to time divide us , " powell said in a ceremony before the meeting , where he unveiled a plaque commemorating 50 years of diplomatic representation to the eu and its forerunners .
the was a mood of conciliation in the air after the month of bitter division over iraq .
belgian foreign minister louis michel , whose country was one of the fiercest opponents of the u.s.-led military action , said it was time for cooperation . " we are beyond worrying about who was right and who was wrong , " he said before the meeting .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .
and if you 're willing to turn in late , you can still make it back to munich by bedtime . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links info on spitzingsee skiing , some in english information on ski rentals , courses , transportation , etc .

tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .
but the ministers clashed over iran 's nuclear program . just as the ministers showed the first tentative signs of reconciliation after the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , the next can of worms popped open and out sprang iran .
the issue of iran 's nuclear program took center stage at the foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels , as u.s. secretary of state colin powell said the eu was n't being tough enough with teheran , which washington suspects of trying to develop atomic weapons . powell made the comments after talks with eu foreign ministers on tuesday in brussels , where the u.s. secretary of state and his european counterparts had come together in the hopes of putting their acrimonious divisions over iraq behind them . after what power described as " very candid discussions " with his eu counterparts , he told a news conference that the wording of a document put forward by britain , france and germany was not strong enough when it comes to iran 's non-compliance with its nuclear proliferation treaty obligations . powell said iran seemed to be moving in the right direction in cooperating with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n.

he made the remarks after meeting with the head of iran 's national security council , hasan rowhani , who said iran would sign another protocol from the iaea which would authorize more checks of its nuclear program . " we have achieved agreements with them , we hope that they will comply with those agreements , " solana said .
" i think that ... they have been honest . " " i would n't have gone that far , " powell said on monday after hearing solana 's comments . time to make up powell spent one day in brussels before leaving to join president george w. bush in london , where he is beginning a state visit .
at the start of the eu meeting , powell stressed the common ground that europe and the u.s. share .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.11.2003 bush flies into fortress london großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror threats and vehement anti-war feelings have contributed to a heavy police presence in london .
security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .
president to be toppled along with displaying over 3,000 “ stop bush ” placards as they march through central london , protestors are set to topple an effigy of president bush in trafalgar square in much the same way as a statue representing iraqi dictator saddam hussein was pulled down by u.s. tanks in baghdad in april .
the metropolitan police have hired about 250 mini-vans to ship officers equipped with body-length riot shields , cs gas and batons to the scene if the protests turn violent . blair defends invite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tony blair will once again meet bush despite opposition .
however , as the crowds prepared to swarm on the capital , the prime minister insisted on tuesday that he stood by the decision to invite president bush to britain .
“ this is the right moment for us to stand firm with the united states in defeating terrorism , wherever it is , and delivering us safely from what i genuinely believe to be the security threat of the 21st century , ” he said . polls show a divided nation despite the prospect of massive public protests , the opinion of the british people as a whole is hard to gauge .
in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .

security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .

also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .

" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .

in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .

eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .
as in the case of france , schreyer considers the measures " intelligent , decisive and balanced , " she told the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has also backed solbes in the matter .
germany 's government should stop blaming the commission for its own mistakes and instead try to solve them , matthias wissman , the cdu 's economic expert , said .
the government 's failure to bring the deficit in line with pact requirements threatens economic stability within the eu , wissmann added .
like wissmann , germany 's federal bank also called on the government to avoid a third violation of the pact in 2004 .
finance ministers have the last word should the commission recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers still have to approve them .

eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .
as in the case of france , schreyer considers the measures " intelligent , decisive and balanced , " she told the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has also backed solbes in the matter .
germany 's government should stop blaming the commission for its own mistakes and instead try to solve them , matthias wissman , the cdu 's economic expert , said .
the government 's failure to bring the deficit in line with pact requirements threatens economic stability within the eu , wissmann added .

the construction of the west bank barrier and europe 's perceived latent anti-semitism are major discussion points . europe 's foreign ministers demanded tuesday that prime minister ariel sharon stop the construction of the west bank barrier at a time when eu-israeli relations are going through a rough period .
the statement followed a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels in which israeli foreign minister silvan shalom took part .
the ministers , who threw their support behind an oct .
21 un resolution condeming the barrier , said the two-state solution to the intifada was now physically impossible because of the barrier .
prime minister ariel sharon , in rome for a two-day visit with close european ally silvio berlusconi , did n't respond to the declaration .
the right-wing israeli leader , speaking to jewish leaders before his visit last week , said that foreign criticism of israeli policy in the palestinian territories stemmed from an anti-semitism that denied israel 's " birthright to exist , " according to wire services .
his office said sharon hoped berlusconi , who 's country currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the european union , will lobby for israel .
" -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- is a staunch fighter against anti-semitism and therefore i think he will be open to our complaints and also to action that can be taken in europe to stop this , " government spokesman raanan gissin told reuters .
foreign minister shalom called on monday for an eu minister 's council that focuses specifically on rooting out and defeating anti-semitism .
heightened suspicion in recent weeks the comments come at a time of acute tension in an israeli-eu relationship that has never been completely harmonious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian leader yasser arafat a deep-seeded belief that europe takes the palestinians ' side in the middle east has often meant sharon 's government does n't take the eu seriously as a negotiating partner .
in addition , the ghost of anti-semitism , which europe has been trying unsuccessfully to shake off , has reared its ugly head in recent weeks .
an eu poll earlier this month showing that europeans believe israel is the greatest threat to world peace further heightened tensions .
embarassing comments by a german parliamentarian describing jews as a " race of perpetrators " and a firebomb attack on a jewish school in a paris suburb over the weekend have weakened europe 's position that it is cracking down on anti-semitism .
anti-israeli sentiment has lead to an imbalance in the way the eu handles the israeli-palestinian conflict , said a government spokesman ahead of sharon 's visit .
" there needs to be a more balanced european policy to israel if they want to play a more constructive role , " gissin said referring to europe 's interest in participating in the middle east peace negotiations .
israel will stop boycott of eu diplomat eu officials view the sharon government 's palestinian policy as heavy-handed , leading to the united nations resolution condeming the construction of the west bank barrier .
brussels is also miffed that sharon has refused to meet eu envoy marc otte because the belgian diplomat met with yassir arafat in september .
diplomats on both sides said they are trying to smooth out the eu-israel spat .
shalom said foreign ministry officials will meet with otte and break the boycott .
he said the eu is willing to change negative perceptions .

the construction of the west bank barrier and europe 's perceived latent anti-semitism are major discussion points . europe 's foreign ministers demanded tuesday that prime minister ariel sharon stop the construction of the west bank barrier at a time when eu-israeli relations are going through a rough period .
the statement followed a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels in which israeli foreign minister silvan shalom took part .
the ministers , who threw their support behind an oct .
21 un resolution condeming the barrier , said the two-state solution to the intifada was now physically impossible because of the barrier .
prime minister ariel sharon , in rome for a two-day visit with close european ally silvio berlusconi , did n't respond to the declaration .
the right-wing israeli leader , speaking to jewish leaders before his visit last week , said that foreign criticism of israeli policy in the palestinian territories stemmed from an anti-semitism that denied israel 's " birthright to exist , " according to wire services .
his office said sharon hoped berlusconi , who 's country currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the european union , will lobby for israel .
" -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- is a staunch fighter against anti-semitism and therefore i think he will be open to our complaints and also to action that can be taken in europe to stop this , " government spokesman raanan gissin told reuters .
foreign minister shalom called on monday for an eu minister 's council that focuses specifically on rooting out and defeating anti-semitism .
heightened suspicion in recent weeks the comments come at a time of acute tension in an israeli-eu relationship that has never been completely harmonious .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : palestinian leader yasser arafat a deep-seeded belief that europe takes the palestinians ' side in the middle east has often meant sharon 's government does n't take the eu seriously as a negotiating partner .
in addition , the ghost of anti-semitism , which europe has been trying unsuccessfully to shake off , has reared its ugly head in recent weeks .
an eu poll earlier this month showing that europeans believe israel is the greatest threat to world peace further heightened tensions .
embarassing comments by a german parliamentarian describing jews as a " race of perpetrators " and a firebomb attack on a jewish school in a paris suburb over the weekend have weakened europe 's position that it is cracking down on anti-semitism .
anti-israeli sentiment has lead to an imbalance in the way the eu handles the israeli-palestinian conflict , said a government spokesman ahead of sharon 's visit .
" there needs to be a more balanced european policy to israel if they want to play a more constructive role , " gissin said referring to europe 's interest in participating in the middle east peace negotiations .
israel will stop boycott of eu diplomat eu officials view the sharon government 's palestinian policy as heavy-handed , leading to the united nations resolution condeming the construction of the west bank barrier .

britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and u.s. treasury secretary john snow announced on tuesday that the row over steel tariffs would not stop the two countries forging a new trade partnership . in a speech held just hours before president george w. bush flies into britain for a three-day state visit , british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and his american counterpart , treasury secretary john snow , have pledged to work together to defuse mounting tensions over a possible trade war .
with the specter of washington ’ s decision to impose tariffs on steel imports into the u.s. looming over the president ’ s scheduled talks with prime minister tony blair later this week , brown warned of a possible retaliatory trade conflict between the u.s. and the eu that could cut economic growth in europe and limit job creation .
“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”
no tit-for-tat war " it would be extremely unfortunate if we got to a tit-for-tat protectionist war between trading partners that should recognize the benefits of our working together . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .
in remarks that seemed directed at britain 's soon-to-arrive guest , george w. bush , brown then added : “ with shared values we must also meet a shared threat .
as tony blair said yesterday -lrb- monday -rrb- , it has fallen to this generation - the generation who were born or grew up at a time when britain and america had together fought world war ii - to fight global terrorism and rogue states . ”

echoing brown ’ s statements that britain and the u.s. share a common belief in liberty and opportunity , the work ethic and enterprise , and a commitment to openness rather than isolationism , u.s. trade secretary snow told the conference that he had " thrown cold water " on the idea of a trade war .
but while gordon brown had subtly disguised his eu rebuke , john snow delivered a message that was loud and clear .
while addressing the subject of the america 's recovering economy and u.k. economic growth , snow turned his eyes to europe and the far east .

while addressing the subject of the america 's recovering economy and u.k. economic growth , snow turned his eyes to europe and the far east . " as we look at the global economy today , it is hard to escape the conclusion that growth has been far too uneven - particularly in the largest industrial nations , " he said . he added : " britain has demonstrated consistent growth , but the other major world economies - particularly japan , germany and france , are operating well below their potential .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .
and if you 're willing to turn in late , you can still make it back to munich by bedtime . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic www-links info on spitzingsee skiing , some in english information on ski rentals , courses , transportation , etc .

security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .

in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .
the same poll showed that more than half of labour party supporters questioned -lrb- 51 percent -rrb- approved of the visit , against 34 percent who would prefer the president to stay away .

eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .
as in the case of france , schreyer considers the measures " intelligent , decisive and balanced , " she told the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has also backed solbes in the matter .
germany 's government should stop blaming the commission for its own mistakes and instead try to solve them , matthias wissman , the cdu 's economic expert , said .
the government 's failure to bring the deficit in line with pact requirements threatens economic stability within the eu , wissmann added .
like wissmann , germany 's federal bank also called on the government to avoid a third violation of the pact in 2004 .
finance ministers have the last word should the commission recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers still have to approve them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.11.2003 bush flies into fortress london großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : terror threats and vehement anti-war feelings have contributed to a heavy police presence in london .
security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .
president to be toppled along with displaying over 3,000 “ stop bush ” placards as they march through central london , protestors are set to topple an effigy of president bush in trafalgar square in much the same way as a statue representing iraqi dictator saddam hussein was pulled down by u.s. tanks in baghdad in april .

however , as the crowds prepared to swarm on the capital , the prime minister insisted on tuesday that he stood by the decision to invite president bush to britain .
“ this is the right moment for us to stand firm with the united states in defeating terrorism , wherever it is , and delivering us safely from what i genuinely believe to be the security threat of the 21st century , ” he said . polls show a divided nation despite the prospect of massive public protests , the opinion of the british people as a whole is hard to gauge .
in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .
the same poll showed that more than half of labour party supporters questioned -lrb- 51 percent -rrb- approved of the visit , against 34 percent who would prefer the president to stay away .
the security bill for the president ’ s visit is expected to cost britain 's taxpayers in the range of ₤ 4 million .

eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .
as in the case of france , schreyer considers the measures " intelligent , decisive and balanced , " she told the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has also backed solbes in the matter .
germany 's government should stop blaming the commission for its own mistakes and instead try to solve them , matthias wissman , the cdu 's economic expert , said .
the government 's failure to bring the deficit in line with pact requirements threatens economic stability within the eu , wissmann added .
like wissmann , germany 's federal bank also called on the government to avoid a third violation of the pact in 2004 .
finance ministers have the last word should the commission recommend sanctions against germany , a two-thirds majority of eu finance ministers still have to approve them .
smaller countries such as austria and the netherlands , who have managed to keep their budget within the limits of the pact , oppose special treatment for germany or france . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu may force germany to trim the deficit a few weeks after facing off against france , the european commission plans a similar showdown with germany over the stability and growth pact .

the construction of the west bank barrier and europe 's perceived latent anti-semitism are major discussion points . europe 's foreign ministers demanded tuesday that prime minister ariel sharon stop the construction of the west bank barrier at a time when eu-israeli relations are going through a rough period .
the statement followed a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels in which israeli foreign minister silvan shalom took part .
the ministers , who threw their support behind an oct .

prime minister ariel sharon , in rome for a two-day visit with close european ally silvio berlusconi , did n't respond to the declaration .
the right-wing israeli leader , speaking to jewish leaders before his visit last week , said that foreign criticism of israeli policy in the palestinian territories stemmed from an anti-semitism that denied israel 's " birthright to exist , " according to wire services .
his office said sharon hoped berlusconi , who 's country currently holds the six-month rotating presidency of the european union , will lobby for israel .
" -lrb- berlusconi -rrb- is a staunch fighter against anti-semitism and therefore i think he will be open to our complaints and also to action that can be taken in europe to stop this , " government spokesman raanan gissin told reuters .
foreign minister shalom called on monday for an eu minister 's council that focuses specifically on rooting out and defeating anti-semitism .

an eu poll earlier this month showing that europeans believe israel is the greatest threat to world peace further heightened tensions .
embarassing comments by a german parliamentarian describing jews as a " race of perpetrators " and a firebomb attack on a jewish school in a paris suburb over the weekend have weakened europe 's position that it is cracking down on anti-semitism .
anti-israeli sentiment has lead to an imbalance in the way the eu handles the israeli-palestinian conflict , said a government spokesman ahead of sharon 's visit .

britain ’ s chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and u.s. treasury secretary john snow announced on tuesday that the row over steel tariffs would not stop the two countries forging a new trade partnership . in a speech held just hours before president george w. bush flies into britain for a three-day state visit , british chancellor of the exchequer gordon brown and his american counterpart , treasury secretary john snow , have pledged to work together to defuse mounting tensions over a possible trade war .
with the specter of washington ’ s decision to impose tariffs on steel imports into the u.s. looming over the president ’ s scheduled talks with prime minister tony blair later this week , brown warned of a possible retaliatory trade conflict between the u.s. and the eu that could cut economic growth in europe and limit job creation .
“ we know that damaging trade and regulatory disputes between europe and the usa have hindered commerce and damaged transatlantic relations , ” brown told business leaders at the confederation of british industry -lrb- cbi -rrb- conference in birmingham .
“ it is time now for us all to make the effort to move beyond them . ”
no tit-for-tat war " it would be extremely unfortunate if we got to a tit-for-tat protectionist war between trading partners that should recognize the benefits of our working together . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steel will not divide the trade partners , says brown .
brown ’ s comments were a thinly veiled dig at the european union , which is considering retaliatory measures after the world trade organization declared the imposition of the u.s. steel tariffs illegal , saying that they broke international trade rules .
and as if to pave the way for smooth negotiations once president bush arrives in london , the chancellor announced a new study of how the united states and europe could further reduce trade barriers .
brown told the cbi delegates that economic expansion through free trade and free markets was the key to growth and prosperity and added that a new study would outline benefits of fairer trade between the two countries which could be applied to a wider sphere . review of transatlantic business brown told the conference that the “ major transatlantic review ” would show that liberalization , the removal of tariff and other barriers , and agreed approaches to competition and regulation could increase trade and investment between britain and the u.s. , resulting in up to $ 100 billion -lrb- € 84.9 billion -rrb- and an additional one million jobs . the chancellor also outlined a series of measures that included more projects between research and education institutions ; scholarships for management studies in both countries ; and a joint forum next year to discuss productivity in both u.s. and u.k. business sectors .
brown said that despite the steel row , britain continues to value its relationship with the united states .
" it is a reflection of our shared values that we are deepening our relationships today , " he said .
in remarks that seemed directed at britain 's soon-to-arrive guest , george w. bush , brown then added : “ with shared values we must also meet a shared threat .
as tony blair said yesterday -lrb- monday -rrb- , it has fallen to this generation - the generation who were born or grew up at a time when britain and america had together fought world war ii - to fight global terrorism and rogue states . ”
snow says smoldering trade row extinguished bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. treasury secretary john snow .
echoing brown ’ s statements that britain and the u.s. share a common belief in liberty and opportunity , the work ethic and enterprise , and a commitment to openness rather than isolationism , u.s. trade secretary snow told the conference that he had " thrown cold water " on the idea of a trade war .
but while gordon brown had subtly disguised his eu rebuke , john snow delivered a message that was loud and clear .
while addressing the subject of the america 's recovering economy and u.k. economic growth , snow turned his eyes to europe and the far east . " as we look at the global economy today , it is hard to escape the conclusion that growth has been far too uneven - particularly in the largest industrial nations , " he said . he added : " britain has demonstrated consistent growth , but the other major world economies - particularly japan , germany and france , are operating well below their potential .

tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .
but the ministers clashed over iran 's nuclear program . just as the ministers showed the first tentative signs of reconciliation after the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , the next can of worms popped open and out sprang iran .
the issue of iran 's nuclear program took center stage at the foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels , as u.s. secretary of state colin powell said the eu was n't being tough enough with teheran , which washington suspects of trying to develop atomic weapons . powell made the comments after talks with eu foreign ministers on tuesday in brussels , where the u.s. secretary of state and his european counterparts had come together in the hopes of putting their acrimonious divisions over iraq behind them . after what power described as " very candid discussions " with his eu counterparts , he told a news conference that the wording of a document put forward by britain , france and germany was not strong enough when it comes to iran 's non-compliance with its nuclear proliferation treaty obligations . powell said iran seemed to be moving in the right direction in cooperating with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , but that the u.s. had reservations about a draft resolution put forward by the three major eu powers . " we 'll be in discussion with our eu colleagues and other members of the iaea as to whether or not the resolution is strong enough to convey to the world the difficulties we 've had with iran over the years , " powell told reporters . nuclear weapons in iran ? the u.s. says iran 's past actions regarding inspections of its nuclear program - iran admits to having failed to disclose uranium enrichment activities and plants - indicates it is working towards developing nuclear arms .
american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and possibly impose sanctions through the u.n. security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward power generation and is civilian in nature . tuesday 's difference of opinion was foreshadowed on monday , when javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , said that teheran had been forthcoming with the iaea 's investigation .
he made the remarks after meeting with the head of iran 's national security council , hasan rowhani , who said iran would sign another protocol from the iaea which would authorize more checks of its nuclear program . " we have achieved agreements with them , we hope that they will comply with those agreements , " solana said .
" i think that ... they have been honest . " " i would n't have gone that far , " powell said on monday after hearing solana 's comments . time to make up powell spent one day in brussels before leaving to join president george w. bush in london , where he is beginning a state visit .
at the start of the eu meeting , powell stressed the common ground that europe and the u.s. share . " time and again , the values and interests that bind europe and america have proven stronger than the issues that from time to time divide us , " powell said in a ceremony before the meeting , where he unveiled a plaque commemorating 50 years of diplomatic representation to the eu and its forerunners .
the was a mood of conciliation in the air after the month of bitter division over iraq .
belgian foreign minister louis michel , whose country was one of the fiercest opponents of the u.s.-led military action , said it was time for cooperation . " we are beyond worrying about who was right and who was wrong , " he said before the meeting .

security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .
president to be toppled along with displaying over 3,000 “ stop bush ” placards as they march through central london , protestors are set to topple an effigy of president bush in trafalgar square in much the same way as a statue representing iraqi dictator saddam hussein was pulled down by u.s. tanks in baghdad in april .
the metropolitan police have hired about 250 mini-vans to ship officers equipped with body-length riot shields , cs gas and batons to the scene if the protests turn violent . blair defends invite bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister tony blair will once again meet bush despite opposition .
however , as the crowds prepared to swarm on the capital , the prime minister insisted on tuesday that he stood by the decision to invite president bush to britain .
“ this is the right moment for us to stand firm with the united states in defeating terrorism , wherever it is , and delivering us safely from what i genuinely believe to be the security threat of the 21st century , ” he said . polls show a divided nation despite the prospect of massive public protests , the opinion of the british people as a whole is hard to gauge .
in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .
the same poll showed that more than half of labour party supporters questioned -lrb- 51 percent -rrb- approved of the visit , against 34 percent who would prefer the president to stay away .
the security bill for the president ’ s visit is expected to cost britain 's taxpayers in the range of ₤ 4 million .
that 's a hefty $ 6.7 million -lrb- € 5.7 million -rrb- bill for a three-day guest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de blair tells congress : history will forgive british prime minister tony blair told the u.s. congress on thursday that if no weapons of mass destruction were found in iraq , at least the world was rid of a brutal dictator .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.11.2003 eu steps up pressure on germany to cut deficit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pedro solbes , right , plans to get tough on hans eichel .
eu commissioners proposed tough austerity measures on tuesday to lower germany 's ballooning budget deficit .
finance minister hans eichel says germany wants to reach a solution , but not at the expense of economic growth . the european commission has called on germany to cut its public deficit to under three percent by 2005 , bringing it into line with the eu 's stability and growth pact which underpins the euro .
the commission also demands that germany slash its structural deficit by 0.8 percentage points , which the government says means an additional deficit cut of at least € 4 billion in 2004 .
" the increase in the general government deficit in germany in recent years is a matter of serious concern , " the commission said in a statement .
the get-tough attitude from brussels toward berlin is a reaction to germany 's failure to adhere to the eu 's growth and stability pact for a second year in a row . the government also shows little inclination to rein the deficit in next year for fear any additional savings measures could choke off the country 's fledgling economic recovery .
the pact , designed to protect the value of the euro , calls for stiff penalties when member countries fail to keep deficits below three percent of their gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- .
at the time of the pact 's creation ten years ago , germany was one of its biggest proponents .
the commission is authorized to take disciplinary measures , including slapping on stiff fines , against countries which run up budgetary deficits over the prescribed limits for three successive years .
german reaction german finance minister hans eichel said the government wants to reach a common solution with the european commission on bringing its deficits back under the strict limits .
" we are keen to reach a joint solution , not on the basis of a financial policy which prolongs the crisis , but one which leads to a recovery , " he told members of the ruling social democrats at a party conference on tuesday . "
eichel said germany had already taken " very strong measures " to reduce the deficit and he repeated the often heard remark out of berlin and paris that the pact should not set strict budgetary targets at the expense of growth .
" there should not be a disciplinary action against a country that has until now followed all the recommendations , " eichel said in a statement .
an escalating controversy german government officials have pleaded with pedro solbes the eu monetary commissioner , to give them credit for their willingness to cooperate in reducing the deficit .
" a toughening of the procedure would be misplaced given germany 's cooperation " with the eu , eichel said in a column for the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper .
but for solbes cooperation and willingness is not enough , rather it is the result which matters .
" if it 's enough that a country comes to the discussion table to appear cooperative and avoid sanctions , this would be a different pact , " he said .
the commission will not distinguish between cooperative and uncooperative countries but instead focus on the results of budgetary policies , solbes added .
tough with germany , tougher with france the call for a deficit reduction by 0.8 percent is 0.2 percent more than what germany 's government is already hoping to save by implementing the so-called agenda 2010 program , an overhaul of the country ’ s labor market laws , healthcare system and welfare system as well as the introduction of new tax breaks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor gerhard schroder , left , and french president jacques chirac both face sanctions by the eu .
the commission already proposed similar steps against france , which is also failing to stick to the pact and has already been told to get back on track by 2005 .
solbes plans to ask paris for a one percent deficit reduction , according to the german handelsblatt newspaper .
support for solbes eu budget commissioner michaele schreyer , who is from germany , had earlier come out in favor of solbes ' plans to impose sanctions .
as in the case of france , schreyer considers the measures " intelligent , decisive and balanced , " she told the berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
the opposition christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has also backed solbes in the matter .
germany 's government should stop blaming the commission for its own mistakes and instead try to solve them , matthias wissman , the cdu 's economic expert , said .

tuesday 's meeting between eu foreign ministers and u.s. secretary of state colin powell showed a spirit of reconciliation after the divisions over iraq .
but the ministers clashed over iran 's nuclear program . just as the ministers showed the first tentative signs of reconciliation after the dispute over the u.s.-led war in iraq , the next can of worms popped open and out sprang iran .
the issue of iran 's nuclear program took center stage at the foreign ministers ' meeting in brussels , as u.s. secretary of state colin powell said the eu was n't being tough enough with teheran , which washington suspects of trying to develop atomic weapons . powell made the comments after talks with eu foreign ministers on tuesday in brussels , where the u.s. secretary of state and his european counterparts had come together in the hopes of putting their acrimonious divisions over iraq behind them . after what power described as " very candid discussions " with his eu counterparts , he told a news conference that the wording of a document put forward by britain , france and germany was not strong enough when it comes to iran 's non-compliance with its nuclear proliferation treaty obligations . powell said iran seemed to be moving in the right direction in cooperating with the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , the u.n. 's nuclear watchdog , but that the u.s. had reservations about a draft resolution put forward by the three major eu powers . " we 'll be in discussion with our eu colleagues and other members of the iaea as to whether or not the resolution is strong enough to convey to the world the difficulties we 've had with iran over the years , " powell told reporters . nuclear weapons in iran ? the u.s. says iran 's past actions regarding inspections of its nuclear program - iran admits to having failed to disclose uranium enrichment activities and plants - indicates it is working towards developing nuclear arms .
american officials say they want the iaea to find iran in breach of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and possibly impose sanctions through the u.n. security council . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran denies that it is working on developing nuclear weapons , insisting its program is geared solely toward power generation and is civilian in nature . tuesday 's difference of opinion was foreshadowed on monday , when javier solana , the eu 's foreign policy chief , said that teheran had been forthcoming with the iaea 's investigation .
he made the remarks after meeting with the head of iran 's national security council , hasan rowhani , who said iran would sign another protocol from the iaea which would authorize more checks of its nuclear program . " we have achieved agreements with them , we hope that they will comply with those agreements , " solana said .
" i think that ... they have been honest . " " i would n't have gone that far , " powell said on monday after hearing solana 's comments . time to make up powell spent one day in brussels before leaving to join president george w. bush in london , where he is beginning a state visit .
at the start of the eu meeting , powell stressed the common ground that europe and the u.s. share . " time and again , the values and interests that bind europe and america have proven stronger than the issues that from time to time divide us , " powell said in a ceremony before the meeting , where he unveiled a plaque commemorating 50 years of diplomatic representation to the eu and its forerunners .
the was a mood of conciliation in the air after the month of bitter division over iraq .
belgian foreign minister louis michel , whose country was one of the fiercest opponents of the u.s.-led military action , said it was time for cooperation . " we are beyond worrying about who was right and who was wrong , " he said before the meeting .

security is at an unprecedented level in britain for the start of u.s. president george w. bush ’ s state visit .
police have been charged with protecting bush from terrorist attacks and keeping 100,000 protestors at bay . britain is on its second highest terror alert as u.s. president george w. bush flies in on tuesday for the start of a contentious three-day state visit .
the level of security in “ fortress london ” and , specifically , at buckingham palace , where the president and first lady will be staying , has been increased for the first time since the september 11 attacks in the united states following warnings of a planned al qaeda terror attack on the british capital . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bush ’ s will receive a private welcome from prince charles when they touch down on british soil on tuesday evening for the first state visit accorded to an american president . the president ’ s formal schedule will begin on wednesday morning with a ceremonial welcome at buckingham palace .
on thursday , bush will hold talks with british prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street before visiting the blair ’ s constituency of sedgefield in county durham on friday . iraq , cuba , afghanistan and steel although there is no official agenda for the meeting between the two leaders , government officials have speculated that the president and prime minister will discuss a possible deal to appease british complaints about britons detained in afghanistan and held without trial in the u.s. base at guantanamo bay in cuba .
bush told the bbc on sunday : " i 'm working closely with tony to come up with a solution that he is comfortable with . " it is also likely that coalition partners will also announce that the united states will lift tariffs protecting its steel industry which last week were declared illegal .
during the visit , the president will also hold meetings with relatives of british victims of september 11 as well as servicemen who fought in iraq and afghanistan . security at highest level the arrival of the u.s. president and his wife in britain on the first visit since the iraq war has prompted police and security officials to take unprecedented precautions in light of a british home office warning regarding a non-specific plot by suspected north african al qaeda operatives .
it is a threat the authorities are obviously taking very seriously in the wake of the suicide attacks in istanbul over the weekend which were attributed to operatives of osama bin laden ’ s terrorist network . " the security is unprecedented because one , the level of the terrorism threat , and two , the nature of the president 's visit , " said metropolitan police chief sir john stevens , the most senior police officer in britain , in a press statement . ring of steel buckingham palace , the queen ’ s main london residence , will be surrounded by a ring of steel when bush arrives , while concrete blocks and metal-detector arches are reportedly being placed along whitehall , the political quarter around the bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houses of parliament .
british parliament .
also , the infamous london gridlock is likely to be exacerbated by the closure of a number of roads in the creation of a " sterile zone " around bush , who will also be shielded by a security cordon . in a move that will see more armed men on the streets of london than at any time since the end of world war ii , a total of 14,000 british police officers - increased overnight from 5000 - will be on duty to protect the american president , along with hundreds of u.s. armed guards . there will also be a large contingent of the plainclothes diplomatic protection squad and the motorcycle escort group , both of which have recently had weapons training to deal with any potential attempt on the president ’ s life . many buildings on london ’ s famous skyline will have police snipers stationed upon them , covering the main points of the bush motorcade as it winds it way through the capital .
as well as high vantage points , sewers and drains will continue to be scoured for devices until the visit is over at the end of the week . fighters on standby for air attack painfully aware of what an attack from the sky can achieve , a squadron of the royal air force tornado f3 air defense squadron is on standby to move closer to london from its base in norfolk , so as to be ready to intercept any passenger jet hijacked by terrorists .
however , the u.s. request for helicopter gunships to hover over buckingham palace at all times when bush is in residence was firmly ruled out .
police will also be charged with keeping an expected 100,000 protestors away from the president during his stay in london .
supporters of the stop the war coalition , the british group who organized an anti-war rally in london that drew more than one million protestors in february , will be joined by several other european anti-war groups - including france 's non a la guerre -lrb- no to war -rrb- , italy 's ya basta -lrb- enough 's enough -rrb- and the axis of peace coalition of france , germany and russia .
bush not welcome , say protestors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-war demonsrators hold placards outside westminster in london .
" this is the man who is in charge of the administration that 's killed 8,000 afghanis and 10,000 iraqis , " said ghada razuki of the stop the war coalition .
" he is adding insult to injury by coming to our country , and he 's going to find out that he 's not welcome . "
" our message to bush is firstly , get your troops out , and secondly , if you think you can go into another country in the same way , think again , " razuki said .

“ this is the right moment for us to stand firm with the united states in defeating terrorism , wherever it is , and delivering us safely from what i genuinely believe to be the security threat of the 21st century , ” he said . polls show a divided nation despite the prospect of massive public protests , the opinion of the british people as a whole is hard to gauge .
in the run-up to the president ’ s visit , a number of polls were taken to test the current climate .
one survey by the british daily independent showed that some 91 percent of respondents were against bush ’ s visit . another by pollsters yougov found that 60 percent of those questioned went as far as branding the u.s. president a threat to global stability , while a poll by the times showed that 59 percent of its respondents believe that the standing of the us has fallen since bush took over the white house . but an icm survey carried out on behalf of the guardian newspaper suggested that 43 percent of british people welcomed the president while 36 percent opposed his visit .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .
an evening stroll along the lake is a must .
spitzingsee can be reached by taking a train to the tegernsee and catching a bus to the resort , or is a 45-minute drive from munich by car .
' a little bit crazy ' yet further west is the brauneck resort , bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on the terrace located in the town of lenggries , near bad tolz .
like the other two resorts , brauneck 's season runs roughly from december through easter .
it is the most well-equipped and busiest of the three areas .
" it can get a little bit crazy on the weekends , " grüger says .
why so busy ?
for one thing , a train runs directly to lenggries from munich .
also , it has a lot of variety , with 16 drag lifts , three chair lifts and a new , high-capacity gondola .
with a lot of steep runs , the mountain will mostly appeal to practised skiers .
one of the runs is four miles long , and another is illuminated for night time descents - set to music .
nicest of all at lenggries , according to grüger , are the variety of alpine huts scattered across the mountains .
" you can always stop in , warm up and have a drink somewhere .
it 's very typically bavarian . "
if you 'd like to experience the mountains without flying down a hill at great speeds on two narrow strips of fiberglass , all three of the resorts also rent equipment and provide trails for cross country skiers , winter hikers and snowshoers .
into more modern ski styles ?
the areas cater to snowboarders and carvers as well , with equipment for rent , and they offer classes for all levels .
and every good german ski resort has at least one rodelbahn , or groomed sledding trail , that will thrill the kids and raise hairs on the neck of even the calmest parent .
germany 's highest peak the three ski areas mentioned above are certainly charming - part of their charm being that they are close to munich and affordable .
but if you want an even more spectacular setting and a more international feel -lrb- at more international prices -rrb- , check out the country 's highest peak , the zugspitze .
the zugspitze is a bit further away from munich , 65 miles to be exact , in garmisch-partenkirchen , but it can be reached relatively easily by train .
the zugspitze is on a glacier at an altitude of 2,000 - 2,830 meters , so the resort has a longer season , offering skiing november through may .
from the top of the zugspitze , on clear days , there are breath-taking panoramic views of the distant austrian , italian and swiss mountaintops .
at lower altitude and closer to the villages are the classic wank-echbauer , kreuzeck and alpspitz ski areas .
garmisch-partenkirchen hosted the 1936 winter olympics , and you can visit the old olympic park and the base of its ski jumps , or take on the olympia and kandahar ski runs , now included in the world cup racing circuit .
after a day of skiing , you may want to relax in one of garmisch 's many pubs - perhaps the landmark inn fraundorfer - or check out one of the five restaurants at the post hotel partenkirchen .

what sets munich apart from other large german cities is the nature on its doorstep .
less than an hour from the town center is some of the best skiing in europe . a winter visit to munich shows the best of german city life : chic yet quaint , worldly yet traditional .
there 's a lot to do in town , from a day at the alte pinakothek to an evening at the hofbrauhaus . but if you like the great outdoors , and you 're looking for a different kind of experience , remember : those snow-capped mountains off in the distance are more than just a pretty backdrop .
for the locals - who tend to fall into the categories " athletic " or " very athletic " - they are munich 's playground , a bavarian style skiers paradise .
visitors , too , can join in the fun .
they just have to know where to go .
heidi grüger , a german-american who lives in holzkirchen , 35 miles south of munich , has been exploring the local slopes for over 20 years , ever since she came from the united states to stay with relatives in the upper bavarian resort town of bad tolz in the 1980s .
" the big skiing news - the really high peaks - are in austria and switzerland , " grüger notes .
but , she says , " there 's some really fun skiing for people who want to stay close to home . "
not the jet-set the südelfeld , spitzingsee and brauneck ski resorts lie less than an hour 's drive south of munich .
none of these has an international reputation or jet-set clientele .
they are smaller , cheaper and more likely to be frequented by locals than the bigger resorts in germany , switzerland , france or austria .
nonetheless , they 're worth a visit , if only to watch the natives at play from the comfort of an après-ski hostelry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paraglider at brauneck reachable by car from munich , not far from the picturesque schliersee lake , is südelfeld , a ski area in the town of bayrischzell .
the 22 different lifts and tows connect 25 miles of runs suitable for various abilities .
of the ski areas close to munich , südelfeld is the most family-oriented and the best for novices .
" its not as spooky and steep as the others , and has gentle slopes where you can see from one run to the next , " grüger says .
nostalgia on the slopes to the west of südelfeld , near the tegernsee lake , is spitzingsee .
here , the slopes are more challenging than süderfeld 's , and there are fewer runs for beginners .
but what makes the resort uniquely special is the nostalgic , old-world feel it has retained - mostly by shunning modernization in favor of traditional features .
feel the years drop away by taking the old-style chair lifts , which offer more of a sense of yesteryear than the modern fiberglass gondolas found elsewhere .
to continue the nostalgia trip , head for the tegernseer braustüble , the in-spot for après-ski activity at spitzingsee .
it is a cozy , wood-panelled brew pub in the old-bavarian style , and it 's very popular .
for a livelier , more modern après-ski experience , the town of rottach-egern , on the southern tip of the tegernsee , offers an array of upscale restaurants and bars .

analysis by stephen evans bbc north america business correspondent two years after a meeting in quebec which opened the drive by the bush administration for a free trade area of the americas -lrb- ftaa -rrb- , talks are beginning in miami this week aimed at bringing this promise to reality .
all smiles .. but no clear agreement ministers from the whole hemisphere of america ca n't exactly be joyful at the prospect of success as they contemplate the creation of a free trade area from nunavut in canada to cape horn half a world away on the tip of chile .
the aim of the talks is to set up a hemispheric free trade area by 2005 - but nobody 's betting their bottom peso on success .
the idea of a tariff-free zone encompassing 34 american countries was a pet project of the older president bush and has been embraced by the son .
cuba is not involved - it 's hard to have a free trade zone with a country with which trade is forbidden !
but it 's a big jump between the will to create the organisation and actually doing it .
the collapse of the world trade talks at cancun show how entrenched the various opposing interests are .
brazil 's concerns brazil , for example , is reluctant to open its markets to the united states while washington subsidies its farmers generously .
steel tariff increases hurt brazil some south american countries are uneasy about letting north american companies bid to do some government work .
there are also issues over copyright protection .
american pharmaceutical companies do not want their formulas used by local producers in south america with the cheap replicas of drugs then available throughout the hemisphere .
limited goals so a true free trade area will not happen .
there will not be complete , tariff-free movement of all goods -lrb- let alone people -rrb- across the hemisphere in the foreseeable future .
what is much more likely is an agreement covering some goods , and then with countries opting out of the agreement on goods which particularly affect them .
the difficulty with this approach is that a free trade area where countries agree not to block or subsidise goods unless they have to is not really a free trade area at all .
how many special case opt-outs do you need before the agreement becomes meaningless ?
bush 's hopes mr bush , it seems , does want the area to work .
he may be smarting under the recent world trade organisation ruling that his tariffs on steel are illegal - which throws into question his credentials as a true lover of the free market , credentials he may want to reassert .
the talks then are likely to be real , not just a formal series of handshakes and statements leading nowhere .
but progress will not be easy or instant .
horse-trading will be intense and may eventually produce a deal - though not in the near future , and nothing close to the existing north america free trade area -lrb- nafta -rrb- covering canada , mexico and the us .
panama v. miami strangely , while there may be no common view on how the free trade area should operate , there may be easier agreement on where its headquarters should be .
the early front runner was miami , often called the real capital of latin america .
it has one rather strong proponent : florida 's governor jeb bush , who has a friend in a very high place indeed .
but there 's some resistance , particularly from countries which produce sugar and citrus fruit and which are annoyed at us tariffs blocking their exports to the biggest market of all .
for some latin americans , miami is too close for comfort to the big american growers with a loud voice in washington .
so , enter panama , at the centre of central america .

recorded cases of aids and hiv infection are small compared to pakistan 's neighbour , india .
until recently many government and religious leaders argued that was because of the moral and ethical values enshrined in the muslim way of life .
now they are waking up to the possibility that prevalence could sky-rocket , like in other muslim countries .
according to the latest statistics , the prevalence of hiv infection in pakistan is small - 70,000-80,000 people , of whom just over 2,000 officially have aids .
hiv : the virus behind aids guide : biology of aids glossary : hiv terms but the figure is certainly much higher , according to imran rizvi from the charity amal .
" these figures remain controversial , " he says .
" we are very weak in terms of surveillance .
i think we all are aware that our health infrastructure is weak and there are issues regarding hiv / aids dealing with stigma and discrimination which prevent a lot of people coming forward . "
and circumstances in pakistan are no different from those in neighbouring india , where the virus has infected around four million people .
" conditions that are prevalent in india , which have created this epidemic , are as prevalent in pakistan , " imran rizvi says .
" and india up to three years ago was in a similar denial mode .
" there are five or six conditions where hiv does thrive under .
one is increased poverty levels , second is a weak gender status , third is increased iv drug use . "
mohammed ahmed is hiv positive .
he stepped on some used needles discarded in a junk yard four years ago .
" some of my relatives look at me with suspicion , " says mohammed , 23 .
" i used to love playing with children , now i do not show my affections at all because i can see their parents think they will get infected . "
religious belief there is still a belief in influential religious circles in pakistan that anyone with aids has veered from the prescribed path .
south asia is at a tipping point with the virus and there 's a small window of opportunity which could be closing in pakistan katey grusavin unicef professor mohammed junaid from the islamic university in islamabad says islam as a system has moral and ethical codes which " automatically control unethical behaviour , which certainly leads to aids and many other diseases of these kinds .
" the ratio of the aids disease infected people in pakistan , it is much less than , for example , the non-muslim countries . "
that notion was common also among some government leaders who believed the infection figures were low because islam 's ethical values prohibit the behaviour which leads to infection .
but that is changing now and , according to katey grusavin from the un 's children 's organisation , unicef .
" unicef sees that adolescents are an absolute key to getting the message out and preventing the epidemic from spreading like wildfire in the country , " she says .
" south asia is at a tipping point with the virus and there 's a small window of opportunity which could be closing in pakistan . "
ms grusavin believes pakistan has five years to put in place a strategy to combat aids - not much time for a country with a poor health infrastructure and big social obstacles .
but she says it could just be done .

the employment and social security department , which has seen numbers rise steadily over the past few months , says the situation is set to get worse .
the department says it is an important change in the island 's economy .
jersey has enjoyed almost full employment for many years .
structural changes as recently as two years ago some businesses were offering staff higher wages in order to keep them as other companies tried to tempt them away .
but the situation is changing and employment president , senator paul routier , says the island needs to be aware of the increasing number of people who can not find a job .
senator routier wants to hear from people who have been unemployed for a long time to try to find a way of improving the situation .
he also said if people want to find a new job , they might have to change the types of employment they want .
he said : " there is a need in some circumstances to change one 's aspirations and move to a different type of work because the selection of jobs is changing .
" i think it 's a structural thing in the island and there is a need to encourage people to look at doing other things . "

china 's largest ipo has raised $ 1.2bn for yangtze electric power after the offer was 70 times oversubscribed .
the $ 25bn dam project will eventually generate 10 % of china 's electricity .
the controversial project will also displace one million people and flood millions of acres of farmland .
huge project despite overseas concern about the giant dam 's environmental impact , chinese investors have rushed to buy shares in the company funding the massive hydroelectric project .
the enthusiasm shown towards china 's largest float of 2003 , has been fuelled by the fact the country 's electricity consumption is rising 16 % annually , and current supply is failing to keep up with the demand .
" the power industry has become a bottleneck for china 's economic development in recent years , " said yang zhishan of china southern securities .
when fully completed by 2009 , the dam will generate more than 80 billion kwh of electricity a year .
the first of its 26 generators went online back in july .
hot shares many expect the shares to continue to rise despite a depressed chinese stock market .
" the company is better than other existing power stocks because it has lower production costs and is a market leader , " said sun chao , an analyst with citic securities .
profits at the company are expected to surge next year when four more generators come into service .
david yip , analyst at merrill lynch , said : " china energy stocks are a hot topic , not only domestically but internationally as well .
power shortages are the best thing for power producers . "
while retail investors tried to buy nearly 70 times the number of shares on sale , subscription levels from institutional investors , who are being offered 45 % of the float , were not published .
the yangtze electric power ipo is the fourth-largest ever in china , following after oil giant sinopec , mobile carrier china unicom , and china merchants bank .
one investor , 34-year-old jian from shanghai , said , " i 'm investing because i 've lost hope in most stocks at the moment .
this is a new opportunity and i want to take advantage of it . "
shares in yangtze power ended tuesday 's trading session at 6.26 yuan , versus an ipo price of 4.30 yuan .
resettlement after 10 years of construction the 300m high dam has meant one million people having to be resettled due to whole areas beside the yangtze river in central china being flooded as the reservoir started to fill up .
whole towns disappeared under the water .
despite this human impact , the chinese authorities say the dam will stop the devastating - and all too frequent - yangtze river floods .
it is the largest hydroelectric project the world has ever seen , with the resulting 365 mile-long reservoir visible from space .

mickey is one of the greatest icons of the 20th century and if disney has its way he will be among the greatest icons of this century too .
mickey began life as mortimer he is the figure head of a global commercial empire and , in the words of former us president jimmy carter , an " ambassador of goodwill and a peacemaker who speaks the universal language of friendship " .
to coincide with the anniversary , disney is embarking on a year of celebrations in the united states and across the world .
seventy five statues of mickey are being made in the us and will tour worldwide .
to chime with celebrations , disney is working to re-invigorate the mickey mouse brand to ensure that its corporate symbol remains one of the most identifiable in the world .
his origins are humble - he first appeared as a scrawny and cheeky rodent in the 1928 short steamboat willie , with a voice provided by his creator , walt disney .
' sympathetic ' he was born out of adversity - created by disney on a train ride from new york to los angeles after financiers backing his cartoon studio had taken his creation oswald the lucky rabbit from him .
his master 's voice i hope we never lose sight of one thing : that it all started with a mouse walt disney disney recalled : " i had this mouse in the back of my head ... because a mouse is sort of a sympathetic character in spite of the fact that everybody 's frightened of a mouse ... including myself . "
disney wanted to call him mortimer but his wife felt the name was too pompous and suggested mickey instead .
the first two mickey cartoons , plane crazy and the gallopin ' gaucho , failed to find buyers but once sound arrived in cinemas , disney embarked on steamboat willie .
the film was an instant hit and the success created the foundations for the walt disney empire .
but ironically , mickey mouse has played a passive role in the creative output of disney over the last 50 years .
official greeter between 1953 and 1983 mickey did not appear in any form , and since then has appeared just 10 times , often in little more than a cameo role .
mickey mouse timeline 1928 mickey mouse is created 1929 first mickey mouse club set up , in california 1932 walt disney receives honorary oscar 1933 first mickey mouse watch made 1935 mickey appears in colour for first time 1940 fantasia is released 1955 disneyland opens in california 1977 wayne allwine becomes third and current voice of mickey 1978 mickey receives hollywood walk of fame star 1983 mickey returns to cinemas after 30-year absence in christmas carol 1989 mickey mouse club tv programme starts - later hosted by britney spears and christina aguilera 2004 mickey 's twice upon christmas to be released in cinemas but he remains the public face of the disney giant , and the official greeter of all visitors to the walt disney theme parks around the world .
and there are big plans to ensure that the most famous mouse in the world keeps his celebrity status .
" mickey is able to adapt to anything that comes up , " said dave smith , disney 's archive director .
" he will be up at the top for at least the next 25 years , " he added .
to ensure that , disney has hired figures from global branding giant nike to spearhead the mickey mouse thrust .
andy mooney , who runs disney merchandising , makes no bones about the importance of mickey mouse .
" this is our swoosh , " he said recently in an interview , referring to nike 's instantly recognisable " tick " logo .
new clothing lines and fashion accessories featuring mickey have sprung up , and a new film featuring the mouse will be released next year .
gamble in something of a gamble , the new film has been made using computer graphics technology .
in the age of the video game , it is no certainty that audiences will take to the high-tec mickey .
mickey is reborn for the 21st century yet the renewed interest in mickey mouse is merely a return to the merchandising and marketing roots of walt disney .
in the early 1930s , mickey mouse clubs offered children games and prizes in an effort to ensure their loyalty to the company .
by the mid-1940s the disney name was selling about $ 100m worth of merchandising goods a year .
walt disney once said : " i hope we never lose sight of one thing : that it all started with a mouse . "
clearly , the disney corporation is working hard to ensure that no-one ever forgets that .
but there is another reason why disney will be pushing mickey ferociously in the coming years .
in 2023 , the copyright for mickey 's image expires - and anyone will be entitled to use the famous image freely .
it was due to expire this year , but frantic lobbying by disney led to a change in the law .
if disney continue to make money out of mickey , then expect more of the same in 20 years time .

spears , 21 , who has just released her fourth solo album , was greeted by 2,000 cheering fans at the ceremony on hollywood boulevard on monday .
" this is something that i 've dreamt about since i was a little girl .
i ca n't believe i 'm actually here with all of you amazing fans , " she said .
she has sold more than 54 million albums around the world since 1999 .
spears was honoured for her singing success , rather than her acting in her much-derided debut film , crossroads , in 2002 .
she has had worldwide hits including baby one more time , oops ! ...
i did it again and i 'm not a girl not yet a woman .
one of the biggest-selling female stars in music history , she is currently struggling to redefine her image from that of innocent teen idol to raunchy sex icon .
she famously shared a kiss with madonna at the recent mtv video music awards in august and has sported a range of risqué outfits , including the one she wore for a performance at the american music awards on sunday .
spears ' latest album , in the zone , has just been released spears has defended her raunchy new image , saying she is still a role model for young girls .
" a lot of people think those photos are over-explicit , but that 's their opinion , " spears told the bbc radio 4 show woman 's hour .
" i think it 's a positive thing to be able to express yourself in a positive light . "
the singer also hit the headlines after breaking down in tears while talking about her ex-boyfriend justin timberlake on us television on thursday .
her new album , in the zone , comes out in the us on tuesday and was released in the uk on monday .
but her latest single , me against the music , was beaten to the uk number one spot by pop band busted on sunday .
the only other performer to get a hollywood star at her age was little house on the prairie actress melissa gilbert .

nearly 90 % of the country 's food needs had been appealed for - and response rates were disappointingly poor .
donors were slow to help eritrea yet there have been no reports of starvation .
some $ 160m was needed to feed the 2.1 million said to be at risk .
a special envoy was despatched by united nations secretary general kofi annan , the former finland president marti ahtisaari , charged with raising awareness in the international community .
this week , on his second trip to eritrea he said he was pleased by the improved response of the donor community " to avoid a major disaster " .
of course no-one is disappointed that a humanitarian disaster has not occurred - but behind the scenes some diplomats are questioning whether all the figures added up .
no wolf un resident humanitarian coordinator simon nhongo denies that aid agencies exaggerated the problem .
" there was no question of crying wolf , " he said .
" by february or march we had not got more than 20 or 25 % , which was pretty low .
since then it has risen to 62 % .
many young eritreans are in the army , not the fields " you do n't have to see people starving on the streets or dying - it 's the damage that happens because of the nutrition deficiencies . "
but of course if the donors start questioning the figures it makes it harder to raise the money next time around .
in fact the 2004 appeal is just being launched .
there has been rain this year but the harvest has still been disappointing .
it is expected that the amount asked for will be very similar to what was asked for this year - so why the lack of improvement ?
one theory is that a lack of manpower to tend the fields has perpetuated the problem - eritrea 's standing army amounts to about 10 % of the total population .
eritrean minister of agriculture arefaine berhe says he feels the main problem is that " there is no lasting peace here and there is not the right environment for people to do their jobs " .
but a recurring pattern of drought is becoming something eritreans are getting used to - and so in many communities is a dependence on aid handouts .
for a proud country with a fierce sense of independence and self-reliance - the goal of finally feeding itself is still a distant one .

easyjet said its pre-tax profits slipped to £ 52m -lrb- $ 88m -rrb- for the year to 30 september .
the company said it had been hit by the fallout from the iraq war earlier in the year and costs relating to its takeover of rival no-frills airline go .
ups and downs easyjet has traditionally struggled in its first half , with weaker demand in autumn and winter during the first six months of its financial year being offset by the peak summer holiday season in the second half .
the airline has also had to cut fares in a bid to fill expanding capacity while fending off stiff competition from rivals such as irish-based carrier ryanair .
as a result , easyjet said its sales for the year had jumped 69 % to £ 932m .
chief executive ray webster said that although there remained " a degree of uncertainty , the economic environment is improving and is substantially better than at this time last year " .

the company says it is switching its purchasing department from its factory in sunderland , to bedfordshire .
the move will mean about 60 jobs being relocated to cranfield .
the amicus trade union has pledged to fight the job losses and is to ballot staff at the car maker , which employs 4.500 people .
the union represents almost 800 workers at the plant , which opened in 1986 and makes nissan 's popular micra , almera and primera models .
davey hall , the northern regional secretary for amicus said industrial relations at the site , hailed by former conservative prime minister margaret thatcher , had deteriorated .
' no alternative ' he hit out at the company 's refusal to talk about the switch of workers to befordshire .
he said : " we are in a ridiculous situation where the company wants people to uproot their lives and families , but will not talk to the workers ' elected representatives .
" these people have not been offered any alternative other than to move 240 miles south .
" we have told the company we intend to ballot our members for strike action . "
mr hall said staff had been given until january to decide whether to uproot their families or lose their jobs .
nissan has yet to comment on the move .
the wearside plant is rated the world 's most efficient car plant and was set a 2003 target of building 350,000 cars , with some models exported back to japan .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- are you delaying parenthood ?
bbc news / have your say graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 18 november , 2003 , 10:40 gmt are you delaying parenthood ?
women are waiting until well into their 30 's before having children , a survey has revealed .
the lever fabergé family report 2003 revealed that a third of women in their 20s who did not have children feared the impact of having a child on their career and 42 % feared the impact on their finances .
the trend is being called " consumption smoothing " where woman try to accumulate as much wealth as possible to lessen the impact of parenthood on their lifestyle .
why are more women waiting until they are older before having children ?
have you decided to delay parenthood ?
this debate is now closed .
read a selection of your comments below .
your reaction my wife and i had our first child three years ago .
we gave up holidays , travel , a car and still do n't have a social life to speak of .
we were both working full time but now my wife works part-time .
it 's a struggle but well worth it .
excuses about being unable to afford a child are rubbish .
you have to sacrifice your standard of living and then it becomes affordable .
kev , uk " too many parents choose that path as they are too afraid to follow their aspirations and dreams " chris ballard , uk i take my hat off to anyone willing to bypass or delay parenthood .
i think far too many parents choose that path as they are too afraid to follow their aspirations and dreams .
instead they settle for the drudge of 9-5 , mediocrity , and financial instability .
there are some who believe children are not necessary to lead a fulfilling life .
it may break the historical mould of societal expectancies , but what the hell .
i 'm going spend the £ 100,000 or so i save from not having a kid on travelling the world .
many parents have their children partly to provide some kind of care and security for them when they grow old .
chris ballard , japan -lrb- normally uk -rrb- finding a companion who wants kids before his thirties is difficult in greece : with two years military service , men are two years late on women , then they want to " live " before committing to a family .
therefore it is also difficult for a woman to become a mother before her own thirties .
with all the " musts " that lifestyle , fashion , tradition plus " family honour " imposes on ceremonial aspects of wedding and parenthood , couples who decide to take their step simply start their life with huge loans and credits - not to mention that you loose the substance over glamour .
so yes , i am delaying , but it is fairly impossible to do otherwise - although i 'd love to have children now - but is it actually possible ? !
maria , athens , greece we planned to have kids in our early to mid 30 's , but oh whoops , had a little " surprise " when i found myself pregnant at 24 .
twelve years and one other child later i do n't regret one second of it .
all the things we thought we could n't possibly do without paled into insignificance when the kids came along and although our lives have followed a different path to the one we expected we adapted and are very happy .
now we know that we will enter a different phase of life in our mid 40 's when our boys are grown and flown the nest .
it does n't really matter all that much when you have kids but they are the most wonderful addition to our lives !
suzanna , brit in usa i am 23 years-old .
i am delaying parenthood until after i have my dphil , so that when i do get married and have children , i will be able to be there for my children .
my mother went back to school when i was 3 .
she was never there for me , my brother or my sister .
my friends are married or are getting married .
they are ready for children now ; i am not .
it is personal choice .
caroline , usa regarding all the comments about being ' emotionally ready ' for children - you never are ; the whole experience hits you like a brick whatever age the parents are .
steph , australia if you have children young , you still have a chance to have your own life and career after they 've grown .
if you wait till 30s and later , the chances of dedicating yourself to your family are cut because you wo n't want to leave your career .
on top of that , it is a simple fact of life that as you get older you do not have the same energy -as the old saying goes ' the mind is willing but the body is weak ' .
as for being financially or emotionally ready - getting pregnant makes that happen !
instead of thinking about yourself , everything goes to the baby - money too !
anon , uk there are enough children in this world .
i am 32 , i would rather adopt a child that desperately needs a home than produce one .
of course , i am not ready at the present time , but i imagine i will be in about three years .
victoria , us " people who bring children into this overpopulated and increasingly polluted world are strangely not seen as selfish " kathy , australia i am unabashedly and proudly a career woman .
i am also childfree .
this is partly because of my career but also for other reasons - including the fact that i simply do not particularly ' like ' children or want them in my life .
i resent the pressure placed on women to have children .
frequently this is for purely economic reasons .
news reports about our declining population are often seen , ironically , side by side with reports about vanishing wilderness , forests , species and the depletion of our natural resources .
people who bring children into this overpopulated and increasingly polluted world are strangely not seen as selfish whilst those such as myself who have enjoyable careers and who contribute to social well-being through our work are seen as somehow ' lacking ' and selfish .
a declining birth rate is not a problem and the choice not to have children is a positive one .
oh - and i note the original report says that only 66 % of women and 41 % of men actually enjoyed their children - a sobering statistic if we think about it !
kathy , australia delayed parenthood is n't always planned .
i 'm 32 and financially stable , but my 4-year relationship is on the rocks , and soon i 'll have to start over again , delaying parenthood until i establish a new relationship with a loving partner who wants children .
meanwhile , an older colleague -lrb- 48 -rrb- has recently had to accept the devastating news that ivf treatment will not work for her .
gabrielle , thailand -lrb- ex-uk -rrb- " women would often wait until their 30s " jim , scotland i was 40 and sarah 36 when we had our first baby .
i thought this was a bit on the old side until i researched my family history and found that in the 18th to 20th centuries my ancestors in rural areas were having children later in life compared to those in cities and towns .
for the men , 30-something was not unusual , some were in their 40s and 50s .
women would often wait until their 30s , and were still having children until their late 40s .
the telling statistic among the women is that the age given at marriage and birth of children was often less than it should have been , in one case by up to 12 years .
back then , women could get away with little white lies about their age , but the official statistics do n't allow for this .
jim , scotland thinking on parenthood is a good idea .
there are too many people who just end up being parents without actually making a real decision about it .
i want children , and am 29 , but i also know that i am not financially or emotionally ready for them .
karen , usa i had my first child of 4 at the age of 34 and the last ten years later .
this was not a deliberate choice , just the way things went for me in my life .
however , as i approach 50 , with a teenager , a 5 year old and two in between , i feel emotionally at the right stage of maturity to be able to parent them well .
i know some of the pitfalls of life and i also have the luxury of being able to stay with them during the day in their preschool years and be home for them when they come home from school .
this to me is not a luxury or anything to do with wealth , it is just the best start that a child can have in life , their mother 's time and presence in the home when they need it , not on a timetable .
carol , us and uk " i applaud these people who are prudent and sensible " mark h , uk nobody should bring children into this world until they are financially able to support the child through its life themselves , not at the expense of the taxpayer .
those couples who wait until they are older are doing so to ensure that they have built a firm foundation for children .
at the same time , they no doubt have satisfied their personal ambitions , career wise .
i applaud these people who are prudent and sensible .
i have no time for those who begin to breed at 16 and raise dozens of kids at the expense of the state .
mark h , uk i wo n't be having children - i never wanted any .
i come from a long line of reluctant mothers and count myself lucky that i 'm the first generation -lrb- i am now in my 30s -rrb- in my family who has been able to make a choice and say " no thanks " without attracting a massive amount of stigma .
i think not having kids is going to make old age pretty ghastly - but you have to make these choices with your eyes wide open .
r a coldbreath , uk from reading previous comments , there appears to be immense pressure on women , especially graduates and professionals to wait before having children .
i ca n't help but feel that society enforces the idea that women are wasting their time if they have children early .
my mother had me when she was in her early twenties , allowing her to really enjoy her life in her forties .
is it really that bad to have children early ?
anon , uk " do it now !
drop the excuses ! "
paul b , uk you do n't need to save , or ' have the money ' , you 'll manage .
kids are the best thing in the world , they teach you more than you will ever know , and fill your life with more wealth than anything money can buy .
so do it , do it now !
drop the excuses !
paul b , uk i 've been happily married for 2 years .
my wife 's 30 but kids are not even on the agenda yet .
she 's a junior doctor working flat out , and we 're both busy just keeping our lives running .
if either of us quit work to look after kids , we 'd lose our house , which is certainly a disincentive !
our situation must be fairly typical , so i 'm just amazed at how people manage to actually have families .
having said that , i do not regard having children as a duty , or an inevitable decision , so we 'll rumble on and think again in a few years .
alastair , suffolk uk i am 34 and expecting my first baby in march .
my husband and i are extremely excited about the prospect of becoming parents .
i do wish i had been able to start earlier , though , as i would like to have been able to have lots of children but i think we 'll be able to manage 2 , and i 'm not as physically strong as i was in my 20s so i think i am probably more tired and will find motherhood more demanding than a younger woman .
choosing when to have a baby was however totally out of my control as it took me this long to find the right man to have children with .
if you are with the right person and both want children and are able to you 're there !
you do n't need luxuries - surely the biggest luxury of all is being able to have your own baby !
i feel that we have been given the most precious of all gifts and ca n't wait to meet our baby .
victoria , uk " i do n't feel old enough , mature enough , established enough or brave enough to have children yet " sarah , uk i am 29 .
i do n't feel old enough , mature enough , established enough or brave enough to have children yet .
the only thing i do have enough of is the love of my wonderful husband .
i sincerely hope that when it comes to it , we are able to have children .
sarah , uk i 'll end up having kids late or not at all .
i 'm nearing 30 and i find myself in the situation where i 'll have student debt until i 'm 40 .
and on top of that ca n't find anyone with whom i would want to have kids .
add in a promising career which is only in the beginning phases .
so i 'm to the point where having kids does n't even seem feasible !
babs , uk my parents waited until they were around 40 to have kids , they had five of us and we 've had no problems .
with the average age rising what 's wrong with waiting until 30 ?
tom , england my ex-wife and i , both graduates , decided to have a child before we had established careers .
she had to return to work more quickly than she wanted to and ended up with post-natal depression .
i ended up feeling guilty to the point of near suicide .
the money became a problem and the marriage is now over .
cant help thinking we should have waited even if our child is a wonderful gift to be cherished every day .
andrew , uk " do n't wait too long as every day you spend with your child is precious " barry n , uk i have recently become a father at the age of 31 .
my daughter arrived five weeks early , and was perfectly healthy if a little on the small side .
less than four months later my mother died .
it still brings tears to my eyes to think that she will not be able to see my daughter grow i am ever thankful that my wife and i had a child when we did so that she could get to know her grandmother even for those few short months .
the moral is , if you want children and are prepared for the commitment then have them , do n't wait too long as every day you spend with your child is precious and none of us live forever .
barry n , uk i 've been married for two years , i 'm 28 and although i want a family i am desperately worried about my career .
every time someone i know gets pregnant i ask how did they decide ?
i have so much control of pregnancy and birth control i ca n't see how i could ever become pregnant by accident .
sometimes i wish i could so then the decision would be made by someone else !
holly , uk why has nobody mentioned the cost to the nhs of the fertility treatment that couples who have delayed having children demand when they inevitably ca n't conceive ?
steve , uk it seems to be that less people want to have children at all in their lives .
i certainly do n't , and out of 8 of my colleagues of around 30 years old , only 1 has any children .
paul , uk i have a friend who suddenly thought she was missing something in her life and at 39 she decided she would like a baby .
so her and her partner got married as she was not having a chid out of wedlock .
this all took about six months to arrange .
and not long after that found out she had been going though the menopause for years .
so they ended up with nothing .
it was so sad to see her dreams slip away .
it made me really grateful i had my kids early on in life .
and can now enjoy quality time with my husband .
ac , uk " parenthood is highly stressful and being financially and emotionally stable has made the task so much easier " gregory nicholls , usa i married late -lrb- 36 -rrb- and i 'm now 44 with a 10month old boy .
i would n't have done it any other way .
parenthood is highly stressful and being financially and emotionally stable has made the task so much easier .
there 's no conflict between lifestyle and raising our boy because we did the ' lifestyle ' thing early and are now happy to spend our time raising our son .
gregory nicholls , usa i agree with the statement that those who can least afford it tend to have larger families and rely on state support .
this makes me , as a career woman in london determined to have children and not wait .
it scares me to think that in 20 years time the uk will be one big sink estate full of poverty ridden families being paid for by the minority who work hard , trying to pay off student loans and stay just above the poverty line .
caz , uk my parents , now in their sixties , married in their early twenties and yet did not have children until mum had reached her early thirties .
i know other people of their age with the same story .
i do not think that this is a phenomenon created by society .
my mother never had a high flying career and neither had any student debt .
it was just their preference .
i think that it is perfectly normal to want to wait until your thirties and have achieved experiences not possible with children that give you the responsibility and maturity that parenthood requires .
emily , england " money can be tight , but you have to choose what is right for you " claire p , uk at 29 and a mother of a four year old and a 10 week old , i am pleased to have had my children when i did .
money can be tight , but you have to choose what is right for you .
it does concern me that all of these women who delay having children in favour of a career , will be then moaning that they ca n't get pregnant and need ivf because they are too old .
if you try to have a career so you can afford a baby , you have it all wrong , if you work out how much it costs you will never be able to afford it , and the holidays , nice cars and houses always get in the way .
claire p , uk i am 38 and married but do not have a child .
not because we delayed but neither of us want to have a child .
the problem is people hardly believe the following : we are happy , we are normal , we are responsible .
my home country treat women who have no children like a criminal or mentally ill .
uk is not that kind of society but lots of stigmas are still there .
alisya , uk i 've been married for two years , i 'm 28 and although i want a family i am desperately worried about my career .
every time someone i know gets pregnant i ask how did they decide ?
i have so much control of pregnancy and birth control i ca n't see how i could ever become pregnant by accident .
sometimes i wish i could so then the decision would be made by someone else !
holly , uk the reason that people give of not being emotionally or mentally prepared and of not being able to afford children is something i can not relate to .
i had my first child at 24 and it was totally unplanned but when it happens everything just comes together and falls into place .
you find you have emotional and mental strengths you never knew you had and you manage financially .
i am now 29 and have completed my family with two children and it feels great to know that i have longer to enjoy them and so do their grandparents .
i still work full-time and am able to provide for my children .
do n't forget children take up a lot of energy , something we run out of as we get older .
ab , uk " the catch is , society may be evolving to later parenthood , but biology is n't " tony , uk the people i know delay for personal reasons -lrb- usually they want to use their time and money to enjoy themselves -rrb- , not society ones - actually , society does value motherhood , there are many tax and benefit perks for parents .
the catch is , society may be evolving to later parenthood , but biology is n't .
the longer it 's delayed , the greater the risk that the parents fertility will have faded .
tony , uk i agree with allyson , i am a 27 year old male and believe it or not there 's nothing i 'd like better than to find someone to share my life with and have kids .
but unfortunately people like us do n't get paid what we deserve in the uk , i am constantly counting the pennies and i do n't even have enough for myself ...
let alone a family .
anon , uk i 'm not sure it 's the right thing to do , but i ca n't afford a child yet , and i feel like i 've barely started my career .
i 'm 27 , have been in a stable loving relationship for 10 years , and have a phd .
i just do n't earn enough to provide for the basics , let alone all the " nice " things you want for your child .
i also would n't be able to get maternity leave , as my contracts are always too short term , i ca n't find a permanent or even semi permanent job anywhere in the uk .
maybe i should just move abroad like other scientists !
allyson , uk my girlfriend and i have just had our first baby .
we are both 27 , and although it was unplanned , has been the best thing we have ever done .
children do n't need lavish gifts and holidays , they need love .
danny , uk " men are as much ' to blame ' in this trend as we women ! "
jh , uk i am nearly 29 and would love to have children .
unfortunately , i simply have n't found a partner with whom i would want to have them .
given the fact that adolescent behaviour seems to go on well into people 's 30s nowadays , i can not imagine finding the ' right ' partner any time soon .
men are as much ' to blame ' in this trend as we women !
jh , uk there is another problem that 's not mentioned very often .
it is hard to find a man in their twenties who wants children .
most of them run a mile if you mention children .
anon , uk women should stay at home and have children as soon as they can .
this is part of their commitment to life .
paul brown , uk i delayed having a child until we could afford it .
mortgages are large these days and child care is expensive .
not to mention the attitude of people around me .
when i returned to work after 21 weeks of maternity leave my manager refused to give me a decent annual work appraisal -lrb- which affects pay -rrb- because i had been off " sick " for five months .
until we are valued as mothers , as well as workers , professional women will delay having children .
kate , uk my partner and i delayed having children because we realised that we were too rich to qualify for significant assistance , but too poor to afford childcare .
we could n't give up our jobs and continue to pay the mortgage on our small flat in a run down area of london .
therefore , our choices were to downsize completely , or put off having children until we were earning enough for childcare .
david t , uk " it 's called prudence , not selfishness " paul , uk those waiting until they 're in their thirties or older before having children are usually graduates or from other managerial or professional backgrounds .
they are educated and aspirational , both for themselves and more importantly for their own children when the time comes .
given the burden of student debt , high property prices , and job insecurity , not to mention the cost of a good education for your children , is it any wonder that our graduates are waiting longer before having children .
it 's called prudence , not selfishness .
paul , uk our generation is better off and in a far better position to raise families than any in the past .
all these excuses are just different ways of saying that we do n't want to give up our material comforts .
that 's fine , but we should accept that this is our real issue .
we ca n't seem to get past the idea that we need two cars , a dishwasher a computer and a plasma screen tv before we can contemplate a family .
i greatly regret having children late - i will have to delay retirement because i 'll still be rearing children in my 60s .
dave brown , london , uk my wife and i are purposely delaying trying for a baby until we feel that we are financially in a position to be able to afford to have one .
what with the astronomical cost of living in the uk , we feel it is necessary to be prudential with our plans .
simon , uk working families can not afford the cost of bringing up children and running a home .
meanwhile , the lower classes can churn the kids out in exchange for yet more state benefit .
darren , uk i delayed having children .
in fact i delayed getting married at all !
now i 'm 50 and i regret it .
mainly because our ' do-gooder ' , ' nanny ' society makes it difficult for people of my age to adopt a child .
geraldine , uk " if this trend continues then the kids of the next generation are likely to not have any grandparents " ian h , england all great points , but if this trend continues then the kids of the next generation are likely to not have any grandparents to help out with childcare , therefore the whole cycle starts again with parents having children earlier .
this may seem trivial , but it is necessary for a lot of parents , my wife and i included , we are in our early thirties with good careers and have two toddlers who spend mon-fri split between nursery and grandparents .
our careers do not allow part-time work which severely restricts the balance between finances and childcare .
we are lucky , if it was n't for grandparents we would be in trouble .
ian h , england you will always find a excuse for not being ready .
a majority of people never usually plan to have there baby , but when they arrive , you will always find ways to provide for your baby the best you can .
it is human nature to survive .
if you ask yourself the question can i afford to have a baby , you will never have them .
craig , uk i totally agree with craig , uk .
not being able to afford a child is an excuse that many people use , including myself .
myself and my husband have now decided that if we carry on like that , we 'll still be contemplating having a family when we 're 60 .
we are now " practicing " for our first and ca n't wait !
hb , leeds i totally agree with craig .
a friend of mine said a couple of years ago " if you wait until you can afford them , you 'll never have children " .
it is true .
i now have a 16 month old daughter who wants for nothing and she is the best thing that my husband and i have ever done .
i was 31 when i had her , and i feel that i was ready emotionally to cope with the most important " job " i would ever have .
we are far from well off -lrb- my husband is just about to finish his degree -rrb- but we work hard and the financial juggling is made easier by watching her change and grow each day .
mary , uk " the primary reason is that society just does n't value motherhood " graeme phillips , germany the main reason women are delaying having children or even not having them at all is not one of the reasons suggested .
the primary reason is that society just does n't value motherhood and society 's views are such that having a child cramps one 's style .
graeme phillips , germany , normally uk no great surprise considering the incredible cost of living these days .
house prices are high , job security is low and an increasing number of people have to move away from their family to find work .
alan , uk i 'll be paying my student loan off until i 'm 32 so there 's no chance that i 'll be able to have children until i 'm well into my 30 's .
i 'm one of the lucky ones though , my friend has just calculated that she 'll be paying her loan off into her 50 's .
the reason so many women are delaying and in some cases avoiding motherhood is that they 're still paying off their education and also fear that they wo n't be able to afford to send any children to university wither because the costs will be astronomical by then .
alex , uk oh my god , this is me !
i am 29 and intend to spend at least another three years establishing myself in my career and building up the savings so we do n't suffer too much when we eventually do have children .
my husband -lrb- age 33 -rrb- feels the same way as i do so it 's not a problem , although both our parents are desperate for grandchildren and feel we 're waiting too long .
it 's an issue that surfaces occasionally and causes some friction .
but it 's our decision so they 'll have to respect that .
helen , uk as a trend it probably runs in families .
my parents married at 23 and 21 , but waited 7 years before i was born .
my wife 's parents waited even longer .
we married when i was 30 and she 27 , but held off 5 years before our first child and 3 more for the second .
in the meantime , we travelled and had a great time before being tied down !
andy millward , uk " if we kept making excuses we would never get round to it ! "
rick , york , england me and my partner kept delaying parenthood for all the usual reasons like buying houses , money etc .
i then dawned on us that if we kept making excuses we would never get round to it !
we are now expecting our first child and could n't be happier !
rick , york , england seems that the only women delaying children are those that can afford them .
those on benefit and do n't work have them all the time as they know the state and all of us that pay taxes will look after them .
stephen , gb what about the fact that many women just do not feel ready to have children in their twenties ?
i am 32 and i spent my twenties , not having a high flying career but travelling and doing several different jobs that have made me into a mature , independent and stable person who knows who she is and what she wants .
i believe that due to the experiences i have had in my life i will be able to offer children - when i have them - a more complete and happy upbringing to the one i could have offered had i had children 10 years ago .
karin , uk you must be talking about sensible and intelligent parents or mothers who actually think about their abilities to raise a child .
i have got a different opinion but i must have walked round wrong parts of the cities or watched too much trisha !
inga , england i am 27 and would like nothing more than to get married and have children .
i am one of 4 children and would like to have 4 of my own some time soon .
whilst i have a partner of 8 years and we plan to marry and have children we are held back by the cost of having kids .
we both have good jobs in the city and own a flat in central london which has proved to be a good investment , but between us we are paying back over £ 800 a month in student loans and graduate loans -lrb- which we took out for further education -rrb- .
until we pay these off -lrb- in about 20 months time -rrb- we are simply not in a position to start a family .
i believe that this position is similar for many -lrb- if not all -rrb- graduates , that is we can not begin on this new and exciting chapter of our lives until we have cleared the debt from our student days .
this for us is 6 years after we graduated .
i wish that the government had n't forced us responsible graduates into this position .
tamara , uk " it 's about time that people realised that women do not have to give up everything to have children " kay bruinster , scotland i think that the time to become a parent moves on at least 5 or 6 years with each new generation .
in the 70s and 80s it was deemed socially acceptable to have children in your 20 's .
however , now that women play a more prominent role in society more and more people are leaving this till they are in their 30s as they do not want to give up a promising career until they are well established in that job .
i am in my late 20s and have no immediate desire to start a family until i am in my 30s , and i do n't think there is anything wrong with that .
surely society should be allowed to evolve .
it 's about time that people realised that women do not have to give up everything to have children , indeed they can achieve a lot before and after having a family .
kay bruinster , scotland i think it is up to the individual as to whether they have children later in life , as the child will be the one to suffer if the parent / s are not ready .
if a women has a child but does not really want one then , the child will feel unloved and unwanted when the parent / s could be brilliant parent / s even if it is a couple of years later sara , england circumstances not choice forced me to wait for children until i was in my thirties .
i had my second child just after my 37th birthday and almost immediately afterwards , started the menopause , which tends to come early in my family .
now i am grateful i did not wait any longer and caution other women thinking of started a family in late thirties to be aware of the possibility that the time clock may be ticking away faster than they think .
a boots , uk i waited until i was 34 to have my first child not because of finances or my career , though not having children in my 20 's enabled me to develop my career , but because i did n't feel ready before then either emotionally or mentally .
i think woman are deciding to have children later because they now have more choices and that ca n't be a bad thing .
am , uk i have chosen to forgo parenthood altogether .
my reason is because i do n't want to risk losing my home .
all too often when parents separate them male is required , usually by the courts , to leave the family home .
i could not stand by while another male moved into my former home and ' took my place ' within my family !
david peers , uk i considered this issue but actually approached it from the opposite direction and had my children before my career and lifestyle had reached a point where i would find it hard to compromise .
i have gone back to work part time after both my children and have a fulfilling career although i am slightly behind my peers .
however , i am now watching my friends agonise over the ' right ' time to have a baby and i am so glad i do n't have to make that decision !
rachel , england people should realise that times are changing .
women want careers these days and it makes sense to make money and be secure before you start to raise a family .
dominic lanceville , uk " delay parenthood ?
i 'm planning on bypassing it entirely " lori smith , uk delay parenthood ?
i 'm planning on bypassing it entirely .
not because i have a wonderful career that i wish to focus on , however , but because i believe that having children is best left to those who want to do it .
i do n't think i 'll change my mind and i do n't think i 'm selfish - my instincts do n't lead that way so why ruin the lives of three just to conform ?
lori smith , uk i 'm not just delaying it ; i 'm never going to have children .
it 's partly because i 've never really had any strong maternal feelings , but to be honest , for me the thought of losing my career and my financial independence , and being thought second rate at work simply because i am a female with children , is something i am not prepared to put up with .
if i were a man i might be more ambivalent but in today 's society it is clear that , particularly in relation to career choices and in the fact that we still do not have true freedom to choose roles other than the more traditional ones , women still do not have true equality with men .
caroline , uk it seems like parents just ca n't win .
if the findings were the other way around , with people having children early , there 'd instead be a news story about people ' sponging ' off the state to support children they ca n't afford .
people will have kids when they want to , and they should n't have to read ' news ' stories like this making them feel second-rate for their choices .
