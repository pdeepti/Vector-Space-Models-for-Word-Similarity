of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .
a year ago he made the news with pejorative statements against gays and their rights to adopt a child .
he referred to it as the " de-naturalization of the family , " and called on people to show " civil courage " in opposing such a trend .
back in november 2000 he again directed several slurs against homosexuality while speaking in the bundestag about the need to counteract homosexuality .
the three monotheistic religions all would castigate gays , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .
that ’ s why it ’ s worth it .

but federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said in berlin on friday that research on the human genome was " of great importance for german innovation " and would remain a top priority for her department despite current budgetary constraints .
she said the national genome research network , founded in 2001 , had made good progress in promoting interdisciplinary cooperation in functional genome research and that this must continue .
the national genome network , a body of research units from universities and biomedical companies , started working in 2001 and has yielded considerable results since , propelling germany into the field of the world ’ s leading nations in human genome analysis .
bulmahn added that scientists today know more about the role of single genes or groups of genes in causing allergies and diseases such as cancer as a result of the research .
80 patents " over the next three years , the research ministry will allocate another € 135 million to the national genome network , " bulmahn said .
the money comes on top of € 180 million berlin has already invested in the program .
the network has already applied for more than 80 patents and received 17 as a direct result of the research , and bulmahn says it has developed 94 " concrete product ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn " the money will predominantly be used to find out how specific genes affect the outbreak of cardiovascular , neurological and environmental diseases .
the researchers ’ ultimate goal is to be able to diagnose these diseases early and reliably and then administer medication tailor made for the patient . "
researchers greeted bulmahn 's announcement on friday .
" research minister bulmahn pointed out that research on genome projects had already created hundreds of new jobs in germany , " detlev ganten , a scientist at berlin ’ s delbrück center for molecular medicine , told deutshe welle .

at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .
that ’ s why it ’ s worth it .
an hiv patient is an expensive citizen . "
and those are lessons , katlama and the other participants at the european aids conference are hoping will be taken by eastern europe - which could face a serious and devastating crisis if it is unable to bring its hiv infection rates under control . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aids conference ends with pledges and protests at the end of the international conference on aids in paris on wednesday , world leaders talked of funding in excess of a billion dollars each .
protesters outside were not convinced .

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .
a year ago he made the news with pejorative statements against gays and their rights to adopt a child .
he referred to it as the " de-naturalization of the family , " and called on people to show " civil courage " in opposing such a trend .
back in november 2000 he again directed several slurs against homosexuality while speaking in the bundestag about the need to counteract homosexuality .

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .
a year ago he made the news with pejorative statements against gays and their rights to adopt a child .
he referred to it as the " de-naturalization of the family , " and called on people to show " civil courage " in opposing such a trend .
back in november 2000 he again directed several slurs against homosexuality while speaking in the bundestag about the need to counteract homosexuality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2003 researchers warn about aids in eastern europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aids infected woman is helped by a nurse in a desolated hospice in the ukraine .
of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .

of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .
that ’ s why it ’ s worth it .

of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .
a year ago he made the news with pejorative statements against gays and their rights to adopt a child .
he referred to it as the " de-naturalization of the family , " and called on people to show " civil courage " in opposing such a trend .
back in november 2000 he again directed several slurs against homosexuality while speaking in the bundestag about the need to counteract homosexuality .
the three monotheistic religions all would castigate gays , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .
a year ago he made the news with pejorative statements against gays and their rights to adopt a child .
he referred to it as the " de-naturalization of the family , " and called on people to show " civil courage " in opposing such a trend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2003 researchers warn about aids in eastern europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aids infected woman is helped by a nurse in a desolated hospice in the ukraine .
of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .
that ’ s why it ’ s worth it .
an hiv patient is an expensive citizen . "
and those are lessons , katlama and the other participants at the european aids conference are hoping will be taken by eastern europe - which could face a serious and devastating crisis if it is unable to bring its hiv infection rates under control . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aids conference ends with pledges and protests at the end of the international conference on aids in paris on wednesday , world leaders talked of funding in excess of a billion dollars each .

but federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said in berlin on friday that research on the human genome was " of great importance for german innovation " and would remain a top priority for her department despite current budgetary constraints .
she said the national genome research network , founded in 2001 , had made good progress in promoting interdisciplinary cooperation in functional genome research and that this must continue .
the national genome network , a body of research units from universities and biomedical companies , started working in 2001 and has yielded considerable results since , propelling germany into the field of the world ’ s leading nations in human genome analysis .
bulmahn added that scientists today know more about the role of single genes or groups of genes in causing allergies and diseases such as cancer as a result of the research .
80 patents " over the next three years , the research ministry will allocate another € 135 million to the national genome network , " bulmahn said .
the money comes on top of € 180 million berlin has already invested in the program .
the network has already applied for more than 80 patents and received 17 as a direct result of the research , and bulmahn says it has developed 94 " concrete product ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn " the money will predominantly be used to find out how specific genes affect the outbreak of cardiovascular , neurological and environmental diseases .
the researchers ’ ultimate goal is to be able to diagnose these diseases early and reliably and then administer medication tailor made for the patient . "
researchers greeted bulmahn 's announcement on friday .
" research minister bulmahn pointed out that research on genome projects had already created hundreds of new jobs in germany , " detlev ganten , a scientist at berlin ’ s delbrück center for molecular medicine , told deutshe welle .
" this would continue as science departments and industry carried on pooling their efforts in this key sector . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .
a year ago he made the news with pejorative statements against gays and their rights to adopt a child .
he referred to it as the " de-naturalization of the family , " and called on people to show " civil courage " in opposing such a trend .
back in november 2000 he again directed several slurs against homosexuality while speaking in the bundestag about the need to counteract homosexuality .
the three monotheistic religions all would castigate gays , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .
that ’ s why it ’ s worth it .
an hiv patient is an expensive citizen . "
and those are lessons , katlama and the other participants at the european aids conference are hoping will be taken by eastern europe - which could face a serious and devastating crisis if it is unable to bring its hiv infection rates under control . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aids conference ends with pledges and protests at the end of the international conference on aids in paris on wednesday , world leaders talked of funding in excess of a billion dollars each .

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .
a year ago he made the news with pejorative statements against gays and their rights to adopt a child .
he referred to it as the " de-naturalization of the family , " and called on people to show " civil courage " in opposing such a trend .
back in november 2000 he again directed several slurs against homosexuality while speaking in the bundestag about the need to counteract homosexuality .
the three monotheistic religions all would castigate gays , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .
a year ago he made the news with pejorative statements against gays and their rights to adopt a child .
he referred to it as the " de-naturalization of the family , " and called on people to show " civil courage " in opposing such a trend .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 01.11.2003 researchers warn about aids in eastern europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an aids infected woman is helped by a nurse in a desolated hospice in the ukraine .
of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "

of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "

but federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said in berlin on friday that research on the human genome was " of great importance for german innovation " and would remain a top priority for her department despite current budgetary constraints .
she said the national genome research network , founded in 2001 , had made good progress in promoting interdisciplinary cooperation in functional genome research and that this must continue .
the national genome network , a body of research units from universities and biomedical companies , started working in 2001 and has yielded considerable results since , propelling germany into the field of the world ’ s leading nations in human genome analysis .
bulmahn added that scientists today know more about the role of single genes or groups of genes in causing allergies and diseases such as cancer as a result of the research .
80 patents " over the next three years , the research ministry will allocate another € 135 million to the national genome network , " bulmahn said .
the money comes on top of € 180 million berlin has already invested in the program .
the network has already applied for more than 80 patents and received 17 as a direct result of the research , and bulmahn says it has developed 94 " concrete product ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn " the money will predominantly be used to find out how specific genes affect the outbreak of cardiovascular , neurological and environmental diseases .
the researchers ’ ultimate goal is to be able to diagnose these diseases early and reliably and then administer medication tailor made for the patient . "
researchers greeted bulmahn 's announcement on friday .
" research minister bulmahn pointed out that research on genome projects had already created hundreds of new jobs in germany , " detlev ganten , a scientist at berlin ’ s delbrück center for molecular medicine , told deutshe welle .
" this would continue as science departments and industry carried on pooling their efforts in this key sector . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .
that ’ s why it ’ s worth it .
an hiv patient is an expensive citizen . "
and those are lessons , katlama and the other participants at the european aids conference are hoping will be taken by eastern europe - which could face a serious and devastating crisis if it is unable to bring its hiv infection rates under control . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aids conference ends with pledges and protests at the end of the international conference on aids in paris on wednesday , world leaders talked of funding in excess of a billion dollars each .

but federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said in berlin on friday that research on the human genome was " of great importance for german innovation " and would remain a top priority for her department despite current budgetary constraints .
she said the national genome research network , founded in 2001 , had made good progress in promoting interdisciplinary cooperation in functional genome research and that this must continue .
the national genome network , a body of research units from universities and biomedical companies , started working in 2001 and has yielded considerable results since , propelling germany into the field of the world ’ s leading nations in human genome analysis .
bulmahn added that scientists today know more about the role of single genes or groups of genes in causing allergies and diseases such as cancer as a result of the research .
80 patents " over the next three years , the research ministry will allocate another € 135 million to the national genome network , " bulmahn said .
the money comes on top of € 180 million berlin has already invested in the program .
the network has already applied for more than 80 patents and received 17 as a direct result of the research , and bulmahn says it has developed 94 " concrete product ideas . "

the researchers ’ ultimate goal is to be able to diagnose these diseases early and reliably and then administer medication tailor made for the patient . "
researchers greeted bulmahn 's announcement on friday .
" research minister bulmahn pointed out that research on genome projects had already created hundreds of new jobs in germany , " detlev ganten , a scientist at berlin ’ s delbrück center for molecular medicine , told deutshe welle .

but federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said in berlin on friday that research on the human genome was " of great importance for german innovation " and would remain a top priority for her department despite current budgetary constraints .
she said the national genome research network , founded in 2001 , had made good progress in promoting interdisciplinary cooperation in functional genome research and that this must continue .
the national genome network , a body of research units from universities and biomedical companies , started working in 2001 and has yielded considerable results since , propelling germany into the field of the world ’ s leading nations in human genome analysis .
bulmahn added that scientists today know more about the role of single genes or groups of genes in causing allergies and diseases such as cancer as a result of the research .
80 patents " over the next three years , the research ministry will allocate another € 135 million to the national genome network , " bulmahn said .
the money comes on top of € 180 million berlin has already invested in the program .

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .
a year ago he made the news with pejorative statements against gays and their rights to adopt a child .
he referred to it as the " de-naturalization of the family , " and called on people to show " civil courage " in opposing such a trend .
back in november 2000 he again directed several slurs against homosexuality while speaking in the bundestag about the need to counteract homosexuality .

of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .
that ’ s why it ’ s worth it .
an hiv patient is an expensive citizen . "
and those are lessons , katlama and the other participants at the european aids conference are hoping will be taken by eastern europe - which could face a serious and devastating crisis if it is unable to bring its hiv infection rates under control . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aids conference ends with pledges and protests at the end of the international conference on aids in paris on wednesday , world leaders talked of funding in excess of a billion dollars each .

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .

but federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said in berlin on friday that research on the human genome was " of great importance for german innovation " and would remain a top priority for her department despite current budgetary constraints .
she said the national genome research network , founded in 2001 , had made good progress in promoting interdisciplinary cooperation in functional genome research and that this must continue .
the national genome network , a body of research units from universities and biomedical companies , started working in 2001 and has yielded considerable results since , propelling germany into the field of the world ’ s leading nations in human genome analysis .
bulmahn added that scientists today know more about the role of single genes or groups of genes in causing allergies and diseases such as cancer as a result of the research .
80 patents " over the next three years , the research ministry will allocate another € 135 million to the national genome network , " bulmahn said .
the money comes on top of € 180 million berlin has already invested in the program .
the network has already applied for more than 80 patents and received 17 as a direct result of the research , and bulmahn says it has developed 94 " concrete product ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn " the money will predominantly be used to find out how specific genes affect the outbreak of cardiovascular , neurological and environmental diseases .
the researchers ’ ultimate goal is to be able to diagnose these diseases early and reliably and then administer medication tailor made for the patient . "
researchers greeted bulmahn 's announcement on friday .
" research minister bulmahn pointed out that research on genome projects had already created hundreds of new jobs in germany , " detlev ganten , a scientist at berlin ’ s delbrück center for molecular medicine , told deutshe welle .
" this would continue as science departments and industry carried on pooling their efforts in this key sector . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .
that ’ s why it ’ s worth it .
an hiv patient is an expensive citizen . "

but federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said in berlin on friday that research on the human genome was " of great importance for german innovation " and would remain a top priority for her department despite current budgetary constraints .
she said the national genome research network , founded in 2001 , had made good progress in promoting interdisciplinary cooperation in functional genome research and that this must continue .
the national genome network , a body of research units from universities and biomedical companies , started working in 2001 and has yielded considerable results since , propelling germany into the field of the world ’ s leading nations in human genome analysis .
bulmahn added that scientists today know more about the role of single genes or groups of genes in causing allergies and diseases such as cancer as a result of the research .
80 patents " over the next three years , the research ministry will allocate another € 135 million to the national genome network , " bulmahn said .
the money comes on top of € 180 million berlin has already invested in the program .
the network has already applied for more than 80 patents and received 17 as a direct result of the research , and bulmahn says it has developed 94 " concrete product ideas . "

the researchers ’ ultimate goal is to be able to diagnose these diseases early and reliably and then administer medication tailor made for the patient . "
researchers greeted bulmahn 's announcement on friday .
" research minister bulmahn pointed out that research on genome projects had already created hundreds of new jobs in germany , " detlev ganten , a scientist at berlin ’ s delbrück center for molecular medicine , told deutshe welle .

but federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said in berlin on friday that research on the human genome was " of great importance for german innovation " and would remain a top priority for her department despite current budgetary constraints .
she said the national genome research network , founded in 2001 , had made good progress in promoting interdisciplinary cooperation in functional genome research and that this must continue .
the national genome network , a body of research units from universities and biomedical companies , started working in 2001 and has yielded considerable results since , propelling germany into the field of the world ’ s leading nations in human genome analysis .
bulmahn added that scientists today know more about the role of single genes or groups of genes in causing allergies and diseases such as cancer as a result of the research .
80 patents " over the next three years , the research ministry will allocate another € 135 million to the national genome network , " bulmahn said .

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .
a year ago he made the news with pejorative statements against gays and their rights to adopt a child .
he referred to it as the " de-naturalization of the family , " and called on people to show " civil courage " in opposing such a trend .
back in november 2000 he again directed several slurs against homosexuality while speaking in the bundestag about the need to counteract homosexuality .

although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .
a year ago he made the news with pejorative statements against gays and their rights to adopt a child .
he referred to it as the " de-naturalization of the family , " and called on people to show " civil courage " in opposing such a trend .
back in november 2000 he again directed several slurs against homosexuality while speaking in the bundestag about the need to counteract homosexuality .
the three monotheistic religions all would castigate gays , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but federal research minister edelgard bulmahn said in berlin on friday that research on the human genome was " of great importance for german innovation " and would remain a top priority for her department despite current budgetary constraints .
she said the national genome research network , founded in 2001 , had made good progress in promoting interdisciplinary cooperation in functional genome research and that this must continue .
the national genome network , a body of research units from universities and biomedical companies , started working in 2001 and has yielded considerable results since , propelling germany into the field of the world ’ s leading nations in human genome analysis .
bulmahn added that scientists today know more about the role of single genes or groups of genes in causing allergies and diseases such as cancer as a result of the research .
80 patents " over the next three years , the research ministry will allocate another € 135 million to the national genome network , " bulmahn said .
the money comes on top of € 180 million berlin has already invested in the program .
the network has already applied for more than 80 patents and received 17 as a direct result of the research , and bulmahn says it has developed 94 " concrete product ideas . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : edelgard bulmahn " the money will predominantly be used to find out how specific genes affect the outbreak of cardiovascular , neurological and environmental diseases .
the researchers ’ ultimate goal is to be able to diagnose these diseases early and reliably and then administer medication tailor made for the patient . "
researchers greeted bulmahn 's announcement on friday .
" research minister bulmahn pointed out that research on genome projects had already created hundreds of new jobs in germany , " detlev ganten , a scientist at berlin ’ s delbrück center for molecular medicine , told deutshe welle .

of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .
that ’ s why it ’ s worth it .
an hiv patient is an expensive citizen . "

of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .
that ’ s why it ’ s worth it .
an hiv patient is an expensive citizen . "
and those are lessons , katlama and the other participants at the european aids conference are hoping will be taken by eastern europe - which could face a serious and devastating crisis if it is unable to bring its hiv infection rates under control . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aids conference ends with pledges and protests at the end of the international conference on aids in paris on wednesday , world leaders talked of funding in excess of a billion dollars each .

of the 280,000 new aids infections in europe during the past year , more than 200,000 were reported in areas formerly belonging to the soviet bloc .
the figures are triggering alarm bells among researchers . " in poland , we ’ re observing completely new strains of the virus that are coming here from the east , " said andrzej horban , the deputy chairman of the 9th annual european aids conference , which took place this week in warsaw .
" most of the new infections , even in western europe , have come from immigrants .
they ’ ve been infected in their home country and then they come to poland because we ’ re going to become a member of the european union , " he said .
more than 2,500 researchers from 44 countries convened in warsaw this week for the conference , which reviewed the state of aids research and offered advice on measures that can be taken to prevent the further spread of the deadly disease .
discussion on the disease 's rapid spread in eastern europe dominated much of the conference .
at its close , the delegates issued a warning that , without effective preventative public health policies , eastern europe could face an aids epidemic on the scale of that which has plagued africa in the new millennium .
the chronicle of a story foretold the difference this time , said belgian aids research nathan climek , is that no one can say they didn ’ t know anything about the disease .
the large number of deaths in africa from aids were predicted by aids researchers in the 1980s , and the same now holds true for eastern europe .
" the people who are dying in africa today were infected 20 years ago , " says climek .
" if you go back and read the newspapers from ’ 85 , ’ 86 and ’ 87 , you can read our predictions .
but nobody believed us .
in the first years after infection , people remain totally healthy , and they look healthy , too .
why should people have been disquieted ?
but now we know that every single person will get sick within 10-15 years .
and that ’ s why people have gotten active in africa – suddenly hundreds of thousands are dying .
in central and eastern europe the patients aren ’ t dying yet because they only got infected five or six years ago .
but in 10 years , hundreds of thousands will die in the hospitals if they are treated today . "
nonetheless , there are signs that awareness is changing , said ukranian aids expert tatjana loginova , and countries like hers are moving to control the disease and prevent it from destroying future generations .
the ukraine recently received € 93 million in international funds for use in its fight against aids .
but treatments are also needed for the illnesses that accompany aids , like tuberculosis .
living longer , dying with dignity " you have to build up a patient list and a list of medications that need to be purchased for aids sufferers , " she said .
" for the sick who aren ’ t going to be treated with anti-retrovirals you have to ensure that medications are given for secondary infections like tuberculosis .
and for the third group , the terminally ill , you ’ ve got to create hospices where they can die in dignity . "
still , treatment is expensive and unattainable for many .
it costs $ 10,000 a year to delay the breakout of aids in someone who is hiv infected .
that 's why discussion of prevention measures also played a key role at the conference .
" prevention is effective , " said christina katlama , the conference 's organizer and chairwoman .
" we ’ ve learned that from experiences in other countries like poland , thailand and brazil .
prevention is effective and relatively fast , too .
that ’ s why it ’ s worth it .
an hiv patient is an expensive citizen . "
and those are lessons , katlama and the other participants at the european aids conference are hoping will be taken by eastern europe - which could face a serious and devastating crisis if it is unable to bring its hiv infection rates under control . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de aids conference ends with pledges and protests at the end of the international conference on aids in paris on wednesday , world leaders talked of funding in excess of a billion dollars each .

"
nearly four weeks after making a speech in which he described jews as a " race of perpetrators , " a german member of parliament faces charges of anti-semitism from the jewish community . martin hohmann of the opposition christian democrat union has come under fire from party leadership and the country ’ s jewish community for anti-semitic comments he reportedly made during a speech on the 13th anniversary of german reunification .
on oct .
3 the parliamentarian from the state of hesse referred to the jews as a " race of perpetrators " and compared the russian revolution with the holocaust .
hohmann said that primarily jewish bolsheviks were responsible for crimes committed against civilians during the russian revolution .
he then went on to compare what he claimed was bloodshed orchestrated by jews in russia in the early 1900s with the murder of europe ’ s jews by the nazis in the third reich .
" jews were active in great numbers in the leadership as well as in the soviet secret police firing squads , " hohmann told constituents in his hometown of neuhof .
" thus one could describe jews with some justification as a tätervolk -lsb- roughly translated as race of perpetrators -rsb- . "
although he admitted in his speech that such a comparison " may sound horrible , " hohmann said it followed the " same logic with which one describes the germans as a race of perpetrators . "
jewish leader : ' disgusting anti-semitism ' the content of hohmann ’ s speech , which until thursday -lrb- oct .
30 , 2003 -rrb- was available for all to read on the internet , lay dormant for nearly a month before hesse 's public broadcaster aired a report about the speech late thursday evening . by friday morning the media was quoting outraged politicians and community leaders .
the head of the central council of jews in germany , paul spiegel , said hohmann ’ s comments delved " into the lowest drawer of disgusting anti-semitism . "
he told the national public broadcaster ard that the parliamentarian was " brutally trampling on the fragile seeds of reconciliation between jews and non-jews . "
dieter graumann , a leader of the jewish community in frankfurt , the largest city in hesse and one of the largest such communities in germany , said he was appalled by the remarks and worried that it demonstrated a shift toward anti-semitism .
" anti-semitism in germany has gone beyond the pub tables and arrived at the german bundestag , " he told hessischer rundfunk .
politicians from across the board have criticized hohmann and called for an immediate retraction of his statements .
the hesse state chapter of the cdu was quick to distance itself from hohmann ’ s views and removed the speech from its neuhof web site .
michael boddenberg , the party ’ s state general secretary , demanded that hohmann " refrain from such unhistorical , false and unacceptable comments . "
on the national level , cdu general secretary laurenz meyer said hohmann ’ s statements were entirely unacceptable .
he said he could only hope that hohmann follows the party ’ s good advice and apologizes immediately .
the ruling social democrats were much harsher in their criticism and went so far as to demand hohmann ’ s resignation .
the parliamentary spokesperson for interior affairs , dieter wiefelspütz , said the speech was an unbelievable breech of parliamentarian behavior .
" there is no room for anti-semitism in the german bundestag , " he said .
populism and anti-semitism intended as criticism of the federal politics of the ruling social democrats and greens , critics said hohmann ’ s speech was loaded with demagoguery , anti-foreigner sentiment and insensitive interpretations of the holocaust .
hohmann heated up his rhetoric with descriptions of how the german state gives extra privileges to foreigners by granting them benefits the ordinary german does not receive .
" unfortunately , we can not get away from the suspicion that we in germany no longer enjoy the advantages of being german , " he told his listeners .
he then preceded to give examples of how germany insists on paying out the full sum for reparations for forced laborers and victims of the holocaust while calling on its own citizens to tighten the belt and except hard economic reforms which cut out all benefits .
at the end of his long speech he concluded saying germany needed to focus more on the germans and he called upon his followers to live according to the motto , " justice for germany , justice for the germans . "
a repeat performance the oct . 3rd speech is not the first time hohmann , a former terrorist expert in germany ’ s federal crime agency , has struck controversy .
a year ago he made the news with pejorative statements against gays and their rights to adopt a child .
he referred to it as the " de-naturalization of the family , " and called on people to show " civil courage " in opposing such a trend .
back in november 2000 he again directed several slurs against homosexuality while speaking in the bundestag about the need to counteract homosexuality .
the three monotheistic religions all would castigate gays , he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in his first interview since losing his job , the former leader told the daily telegraph he wished to " move on " and enjoy the positive benefits of not being leader of the opposition .
mr duncan smith has already written one novel , a thriller , but said he was " not making any great claims " to being a talented writer .
meanwhile mr howard was also facing the prospect of a new role , after former chancellor ken clarke confirmed he would not challenge him for the leadership job .

mr clarke said he looked forward to supporting mr howard , his friend since they were at cambridge university together in the 1960s , if he became leader .
" i particularly welcome what michael said about leading from the centre and i hope to see that put into practice , " he said .
he argued the party had " lurched too far to the right " in opposition and he was pleased mr howard wanted to broaden the party 's appeal .
he revealed he had voted against mr duncan smith in wednesday 's confidence vote , but said he had played no part in organising his downfall .
despite his warm comments , he ruled out joining a howard shadow cabinet .

about 400 holidaymakers on the p & o ship were affected by a highly contagious stomach bug , although all but 30 are now thought to have recovered .
earlier on friday , greek doctors boarded the £ 200m superliner after authorities refused to let passengers and crew disembark at the port of piraeus , near athens .
a p & o spokeswoman told bbc news online that somebody had died during the cruise , but that it was entirely unrelated to the outbreak .
quarantined the disease is believed to be a norwalk-like virus , which can cause diarrhoea and vomiting for up to two days and strikes where there is inadequate sanitation - mostly in hospitals and schools or on cruise ships .
they are sterilising cabins , people with masks are cleaning everywhere sheila haigh aurora passenger travellers ' diarrhoea p & o said the ship , which is based in southampton , will continue its cruise as planned , with 1,800 passengers and 600 crew on board .
the buffet , thought to be the food outlet most at risk from person-to-person transmission of the virus , has been closed .
the spokeswoman said spirits on board remained high and that nobody had been seriously ill with the bug .
' confined to cabins ' but passenger sheila haigh told bbc news online she was worried about catching the bug , because she suffers from a rare immune system condition .
" it is n't contained - you do n't know what 's going to happen .
p & o helpline 0845 3 555 333 " they are sterilising cabins , people with masks are cleaning everywhere - the crew are doing everything they can . "
" passengers are washing their hands but i suspect people are not quite as good with that as they want to be .
a lot of people are confined to their cabins .
fellow passenger sheila elton said it was the second time in a year she had been on a p & o cruise that had suffered a suspected norwalk virus outbreak .
" yet again it is like a sword hanging over you , are you going to be the next one to succumb .
we are taking all the precautions and staying mainly in our cabin .
" sometimes you would hardly know there is anybody about - you do n't see a soul which is most unusual .
the atmosphere is a combination of gloom and worry . "
sanitation programmes david dingle , managing director of p & o cruises , said : " we are doing everything to ensure that our passengers are having an enjoyable time .
the mood on board the ship is positive . "
he said the decision by greek authorities to not allow the ship 's passengers to enter the country had been unprecedented , given that the people who had been contagious would have been held on board .
the gilbraltar authorities will decide over the weekend whether or not to allow the ship to dock in its port before it arrives on monday .
a government of gibraltar spokesman said : " reports being received from the ship appear to indicate that all but 30 of the affected passengers have now recovered " .
health inspector earlier a p & o spokeswoman said comprehensive procedures were in place to deal with what was being treated as a case of the common norwalk virus .
the company believes the disease was brought on board by a passenger at southampton , where the cruise began on 20 october .
during a stop in the croatian city of dubrovnik on wednesday , health inspector ivo miloglav ordered the sick passengers to remain in their cabins .
they had not been permitted to disembark during the ship 's previous stop , in venice , italy , he added .
the 76,000-tonne ship has been struck by bad luck , with its maiden voyage cancelled when it broke down one day into a two-week cruise .
and even at its christening , by the princess royal , the traditional bottle of champagne dropped into southampton docks instead of smashing against the ship when a bottle-release mechanism failed .
your comments : my 84 year old mother-in-law is on board , accompanied by her carer .
all her life she has dreamed of going on a luxury cruise , as she once cruised the med with her mother when she was a small child .
life took her in other directions and only now has she been able to realise her dream - a dream which has possibly turned into a nightmare for her .
at her age catching this bug could have serious consequences .
my husband , ian , her son , and i are obviously worried to death .
christine couper , uk i have been on many p & o cruises in the past years and this comes as a shock .
however , please let it be known that this is a shock case of it and most cruises and very enjoyable .
these ships are well maintained and as a previous passenger can believe that the staff are doing everything they can to help every passenger and that most people on board the ship will still be having an enjoyable holiday .

i spoke to them on the phone this morning and so far they have been lucky , neither have contracted the bug .
however mum is very vulnerable after being ill last year , so they are taking extra precautions e.g .. not using the public toilets etc stefany anne brown , uk not on aurora , but came off oceana 24/10/2003 .
the ship tried their very best to look after us including issuing disinfected hand wipes as we went into to buffet .
however , there were passengers who felt this was beneath them and waved them aside .

about 400 holidaymakers on the p & o ship were affected by a highly contagious stomach bug , although all but 30 are now thought to have recovered .
earlier on friday , greek doctors boarded the £ 200m superliner after authorities refused to let passengers and crew disembark at the port of piraeus , near athens .
a p & o spokeswoman told bbc news online that somebody had died during the cruise , but that it was entirely unrelated to the outbreak .
quarantined the disease is believed to be a norwalk-like virus , which can cause diarrhoea and vomiting for up to two days and strikes where there is inadequate sanitation - mostly in hospitals and schools or on cruise ships .
they are sterilising cabins , people with masks are cleaning everywhere sheila haigh aurora passenger travellers ' diarrhoea p & o said the ship , which is based in southampton , will continue its cruise as planned , with 1,800 passengers and 600 crew on board .
the buffet , thought to be the food outlet most at risk from person-to-person transmission of the virus , has been closed .
the spokeswoman said spirits on board remained high and that nobody had been seriously ill with the bug .
' confined to cabins ' but passenger sheila haigh told bbc news online she was worried about catching the bug , because she suffers from a rare immune system condition .
" it is n't contained - you do n't know what 's going to happen .

" passengers are washing their hands but i suspect people are not quite as good with that as they want to be .
a lot of people are confined to their cabins .
fellow passenger sheila elton said it was the second time in a year she had been on a p & o cruise that had suffered a suspected norwalk virus outbreak .
" yet again it is like a sword hanging over you , are you going to be the next one to succumb .
we are taking all the precautions and staying mainly in our cabin .
" sometimes you would hardly know there is anybody about - you do n't see a soul which is most unusual .
the atmosphere is a combination of gloom and worry . "
sanitation programmes david dingle , managing director of p & o cruises , said : " we are doing everything to ensure that our passengers are having an enjoyable time .
the mood on board the ship is positive . "
he said the decision by greek authorities to not allow the ship 's passengers to enter the country had been unprecedented , given that the people who had been contagious would have been held on board .
the gilbraltar authorities will decide over the weekend whether or not to allow the ship to dock in its port before it arrives on monday .
a government of gibraltar spokesman said : " reports being received from the ship appear to indicate that all but 30 of the affected passengers have now recovered " .
health inspector earlier a p & o spokeswoman said comprehensive procedures were in place to deal with what was being treated as a case of the common norwalk virus .
the company believes the disease was brought on board by a passenger at southampton , where the cruise began on 20 october .
during a stop in the croatian city of dubrovnik on wednesday , health inspector ivo miloglav ordered the sick passengers to remain in their cabins .
they had not been permitted to disembark during the ship 's previous stop , in venice , italy , he added .
the 76,000-tonne ship has been struck by bad luck , with its maiden voyage cancelled when it broke down one day into a two-week cruise .
and even at its christening , by the princess royal , the traditional bottle of champagne dropped into southampton docks instead of smashing against the ship when a bottle-release mechanism failed .

all her life she has dreamed of going on a luxury cruise , as she once cruised the med with her mother when she was a small child .
life took her in other directions and only now has she been able to realise her dream - a dream which has possibly turned into a nightmare for her .
at her age catching this bug could have serious consequences .
my husband , ian , her son , and i are obviously worried to death .
christine couper , uk i have been on many p & o cruises in the past years and this comes as a shock .
however , please let it be known that this is a shock case of it and most cruises and very enjoyable .
these ships are well maintained and as a previous passenger can believe that the staff are doing everything they can to help every passenger and that most people on board the ship will still be having an enjoyable holiday .

about 400 holidaymakers on the p & o ship were affected by a highly contagious stomach bug , although all but 30 are now thought to have recovered .
earlier on friday , greek doctors boarded the £ 200m superliner after authorities refused to let passengers and crew disembark at the port of piraeus , near athens .
a p & o spokeswoman told bbc news online that somebody had died during the cruise , but that it was entirely unrelated to the outbreak .
quarantined the disease is believed to be a norwalk-like virus , which can cause diarrhoea and vomiting for up to two days and strikes where there is inadequate sanitation - mostly in hospitals and schools or on cruise ships .

the buffet , thought to be the food outlet most at risk from person-to-person transmission of the virus , has been closed .
the spokeswoman said spirits on board remained high and that nobody had been seriously ill with the bug .

" passengers are washing their hands but i suspect people are not quite as good with that as they want to be .
a lot of people are confined to their cabins .
fellow passenger sheila elton said it was the second time in a year she had been on a p & o cruise that had suffered a suspected norwalk virus outbreak .
" yet again it is like a sword hanging over you , are you going to be the next one to succumb .

sanitation programmes david dingle , managing director of p & o cruises , said : " we are doing everything to ensure that our passengers are having an enjoyable time .
the mood on board the ship is positive . "
he said the decision by greek authorities to not allow the ship 's passengers to enter the country had been unprecedented , given that the people who had been contagious would have been held on board .
the gilbraltar authorities will decide over the weekend whether or not to allow the ship to dock in its port before it arrives on monday .
a government of gibraltar spokesman said : " reports being received from the ship appear to indicate that all but 30 of the affected passengers have now recovered " .
health inspector earlier a p & o spokeswoman said comprehensive procedures were in place to deal with what was being treated as a case of the common norwalk virus .
the company believes the disease was brought on board by a passenger at southampton , where the cruise began on 20 october .
during a stop in the croatian city of dubrovnik on wednesday , health inspector ivo miloglav ordered the sick passengers to remain in their cabins .
they had not been permitted to disembark during the ship 's previous stop , in venice , italy , he added .
the 76,000-tonne ship has been struck by bad luck , with its maiden voyage cancelled when it broke down one day into a two-week cruise .

according to latest research , the silence of the lambs star earned £ 15m last year - but it was £ 6.5m less than in the previous year .
port talbot-born hopkins , commands $ 20m a film , and his earnings in the past year were largely derived from his latest outing as the cannibal doctor hannibal lecter in red dragon .
despite his wealth , however , he only makes the 48th spot in the sunday times pay list , which is published this weekend .
the list differs from the sunday times rich list because it is based on wages or other earnings as opposed to accumulated or inherited wealth .
wealthiest welsh sir anthony hopkins -lrb- actor -rrb- £ 15m andrew vicari -lrb- artist -rrb- £ 10m david sullivan -lrb- publisher -rrb- £ 5.8m david mclean -lrb- property and construction -rrb- £ 5.6m gwenan williams -lrb- lottery winner -rrb- £ 5.5m catherine zeta jones -lrb- actor -rrb- £ 5m ryan giggs -lrb- footballer -rrb- £ 3.95m peter cohen -lrb- businessman -rrb- £ 2.06m craig bellamy -lrb- footballer -rrb- £ 1.75m this year 's top-earner is sir paul mccartney , who grossed £ 44m .
runner-up to hopkins in the wales list is another port talbot-born multi-millionaire , with earnings of £ 10m .
artist andrew vicari who has made most of his money in saudi arabia , where he has been the official painter to the royal family since 1974 .
he is still largely unknown in britain as he has lived in monte carlo for the past 25 years .
he has homes in paris , riyadh , london and cannes and picasso 's old villa in the south of france , which he bought for £ 3m .
his earnings have also decreased from last year , although with sketches priced at £ 100,000 at a recent exhibition in wales he will not be feeling the pinch .
catherine zeta jones ' income has dropped significantly from last year 's £ 20m to £ 5m , following the birth of her carys , her second child , in april , when she reduced her workload .
she now ranks at 6th place in wales ' top earners .
the oscar-winning actress still retains her $ 2m-a-year contract with elizabeth arden and she has a $ 1m advertisement deal with t-mobile .
although the film she had planned to make with her husband , michael douglas , never got off the ground , she will have pocketed a very healthy signing-on fee for the steven spielberg film terminal , which stars tom hanks , and began shooting in september .
labelled " the new george best " in 1991 , manchester united 's ryan giggs has firmly established himself in his own right in the ensuing decade .
he increased his earnings to £ 3.95m this year , swelled by income from his six-year deal with reebok , from which he stands to earn £ 6.5m in total .
giggs earns £ 50,000 a week -lrb- £ 2.6m a year -rrb- from manchester united and has been instrumental in carrying wales to the brink of the finals of euro 2004 .
other endorsements , which include his recent appearance in the pepsi gunfight at the ok corral shoot-out commercial , push his income up to £ 3.95m.
