" what will follow will not be a repeat of any other conflict .
it will be of a force and scope and scale that has been beyond what has been seen before , " he said at a news conference .

u.s.-led strikes begin early thursday the u.s.-led military strike against iraq began in the early hours of thursday at around 3.35 a.m.
central european time with the thunder-like crackling of missiles over the skies of baghdad that lasted about 15 minutes . the white house said the attack marked the " opening stages " of the war to overthrow saddam .
u.s. president bush said that the first phase of the war would be " broad and coordinated " , and that the united states and its 35-nation " coalition of the willing " would seek to avoid civilian casualties .
" american and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm iraq , to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger , " he said the united states had struck " selected targets of military importance " intended to undermine saddam 's ability to wage war .
but the " decapitation " attack seemed to have missed saddam , who appeared later on thursday wearing a uniform and black beret on iraqi television .
saddam called on his compatriots to resist , saying , " you will be victorious against your enemies . "
he derided the u.s. attack as " cowardly aggression " intended to drive him from power .
war begins after ultimatum expires the beginning of hostilities came less than two hours after the 48-hour ultimatum that bush gave saddam to leave iraq had expired .
on monday , bush ordered saddam and his sons to go into exile or face war .
" their refusal to do so will result in military conflict , " bush said , " commenced at a time of our choosing . "
according to media reports , that time came after a four-hour meeting bush held with cia director george tenet and pentagon officials , who told the president that he would miss a " target of opportunity " if he did not act immediately .
taken together , the united states and britain have deployed more than 280,000 troops to the persian gulf region in preparation for a war .
other countries , including australia and poland have also contributed a small number of troops to the war effort .
turkey allows u.s. to use its airspace hours after the strikes began , turkey 's parliament voted to allow the u.s. military to use turkish airspace for the war , giving u.s. bombers more room in which to work .
the government-backed proposal will allow u.s. warplanes based in europe or the united states to cross turkey to strike iraq .
the united states could also use turkish airspace to transport troops into northern iraq or to bring supplies to the region .
but the proposal would not allow u.s. planes to use turkish air bases or refuel in turkey .
the united states , for example , will not be able to use incirlik air base , a sprawling facility that houses 50 u.s. fighters used to patrol a no-fly zone over iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

turkey allows u.s. to use its airspace hours after the strikes began , turkey 's parliament voted to allow the u.s. military to use turkish airspace for the war , giving u.s. bombers more room in which to work .
the government-backed proposal will allow u.s. warplanes based in europe or the united states to cross turkey to strike iraq .
the united states could also use turkish airspace to transport troops into northern iraq or to bring supplies to the region .
but the proposal would not allow u.s. planes to use turkish air bases or refuel in turkey .
the united states , for example , will not be able to use incirlik air base , a sprawling facility that houses 50 u.s. fighters used to patrol a no-fly zone over iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" american and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm iraq , to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger , " he said the united states had struck " selected targets of military importance " intended to undermine saddam 's ability to wage war .

" their refusal to do so will result in military conflict , " bush said , " commenced at a time of our choosing . "
according to media reports , that time came after a four-hour meeting bush held with cia director george tenet and pentagon officials , who told the president that he would miss a " target of opportunity " if he did not act immediately .

more than 200,000 in germany alone . for many of the thousands of peace demonstrators gathered on berlin 's alexanderplatz on thursday evening , it was a return from earlier demonstrations for a second round . as the mild afternoon turned into cold evening , loudspeakers carried the anti-war speeches of numerous speakers , as an estimated 40,000 workers , peace activists and families gathered on east berlin 's former central square . many of the demonstrators lighting candles as evening came were leftovers from student demonstrations held on the square earlier in the day . " we want to animate even more people , " said denise hildebrand , 19 , who together with a group of more than 15 fellow students attended both the school demonstrations and evening demonstrations .
" we want to somehow stir something , to set something in motion . " the start of the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq brought hundreds of thousands onto the streets in european cities from athens to london .
in athens , a record 150,000 marched against the attacks , which began at around 3:35 a.m.
european central time . italy and switzerland saw tens of thousands take to the streets in big cities . law enforcement authorities around europe beefed up their presence around israeli , british and u.s. institutions , and riot police clashed with protestors in several cities . the so-called day x of protests in germany , timed to coincide with the start of the war , was peaceful , with no reported arrests .
in a rehash of slogans from the 1991 gulf war , demonstrators carried placards and banners reading " no blood for oil " and " give peace a chance . " " i 'm against … that they voted for this man " though some protestors in munich shouted " killer , killer ! " as they walked past the american consulate , anti-americanism took a back seat to criticism of the bush government . " i have nothing against the american people .
the only thing i 'm against is that they voted for this man , " said henny frobian , 70 , who was taking part in the alexanderplatz demonstrations . " i belong to the generation that lived through war , " she said .

u.s. president bush said that the first phase of the war would be " broad and coordinated " , and that the united states and its 35-nation " coalition of the willing " would seek to avoid civilian casualties .
" american and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm iraq , to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger , " he said the united states had struck " selected targets of military importance " intended to undermine saddam 's ability to wage war .
but the " decapitation " attack seemed to have missed saddam , who appeared later on thursday wearing a uniform and black beret on iraqi television .

he derided the u.s. attack as " cowardly aggression " intended to drive him from power .

on monday , bush ordered saddam and his sons to go into exile or face war .
" their refusal to do so will result in military conflict , " bush said , " commenced at a time of our choosing . "
according to media reports , that time came after a four-hour meeting bush held with cia director george tenet and pentagon officials , who told the president that he would miss a " target of opportunity " if he did not act immediately .
taken together , the united states and britain have deployed more than 280,000 troops to the persian gulf region in preparation for a war .

turkey allows u.s. to use its airspace hours after the strikes began , turkey 's parliament voted to allow the u.s. military to use turkish airspace for the war , giving u.s. bombers more room in which to work .
the government-backed proposal will allow u.s. warplanes based in europe or the united states to cross turkey to strike iraq .
the united states could also use turkish airspace to transport troops into northern iraq or to bring supplies to the region .
but the proposal would not allow u.s. planes to use turkish air bases or refuel in turkey .
the united states , for example , will not be able to use incirlik air base , a sprawling facility that houses 50 u.s. fighters used to patrol a no-fly zone over iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" tonight british servicemen and women are engaged from air , land and sea .
their mission : to remove saddam hussein from power and disarm iraq of its weapons of mass destruction , " he said in a speech that marked his first public words on the iraq campaign since the beginning of the war .
" dictators like saddam and terrorist group like al qaeda threaten the very existence of such a world .

central european time with the thunder-like crackling of missiles over the skies of baghdad that lasted about 15 minutes . the white house said the attack marked the " opening stages " of the war to overthrow saddam .
u.s. president bush said that the first phase of the war would be " broad and coordinated " , and that the united states and its 35-nation " coalition of the willing " would seek to avoid civilian casualties .
" american and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm iraq , to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger , " he said the united states had struck " selected targets of military importance " intended to undermine saddam 's ability to wage war .
but the " decapitation " attack seemed to have missed saddam , who appeared later on thursday wearing a uniform and black beret on iraqi television .
saddam called on his compatriots to resist , saying , " you will be victorious against your enemies . "
he derided the u.s. attack as " cowardly aggression " intended to drive him from power .
war begins after ultimatum expires the beginning of hostilities came less than two hours after the 48-hour ultimatum that bush gave saddam to leave iraq had expired .
on monday , bush ordered saddam and his sons to go into exile or face war .
" their refusal to do so will result in military conflict , " bush said , " commenced at a time of our choosing . "
according to media reports , that time came after a four-hour meeting bush held with cia director george tenet and pentagon officials , who told the president that he would miss a " target of opportunity " if he did not act immediately .
taken together , the united states and britain have deployed more than 280,000 troops to the persian gulf region in preparation for a war .
other countries , including australia and poland have also contributed a small number of troops to the war effort .
turkey allows u.s. to use its airspace hours after the strikes began , turkey 's parliament voted to allow the u.s. military to use turkish airspace for the war , giving u.s. bombers more room in which to work .
the government-backed proposal will allow u.s. warplanes based in europe or the united states to cross turkey to strike iraq .
the united states could also use turkish airspace to transport troops into northern iraq or to bring supplies to the region .
but the proposal would not allow u.s. planes to use turkish air bases or refuel in turkey .
the united states , for example , will not be able to use incirlik air base , a sprawling facility that houses 50 u.s. fighters used to patrol a no-fly zone over iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

" dictators like saddam and terrorist group like al qaeda threaten the very existence of such a world .

" american and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm iraq , to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger , " he said the united states had struck " selected targets of military importance " intended to undermine saddam 's ability to wage war .

on monday , bush ordered saddam and his sons to go into exile or face war .
" their refusal to do so will result in military conflict , " bush said , " commenced at a time of our choosing . "
according to media reports , that time came after a four-hour meeting bush held with cia director george tenet and pentagon officials , who told the president that he would miss a " target of opportunity " if he did not act immediately .

turkey allows u.s. to use its airspace hours after the strikes began , turkey 's parliament voted to allow the u.s. military to use turkish airspace for the war , giving u.s. bombers more room in which to work .
the government-backed proposal will allow u.s. warplanes based in europe or the united states to cross turkey to strike iraq .
the united states could also use turkish airspace to transport troops into northern iraq or to bring supplies to the region .
but the proposal would not allow u.s. planes to use turkish air bases or refuel in turkey .
the united states , for example , will not be able to use incirlik air base , a sprawling facility that houses 50 u.s. fighters used to patrol a no-fly zone over iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

more than 200,000 in germany alone . for many of the thousands of peace demonstrators gathered on berlin 's alexanderplatz on thursday evening , it was a return from earlier demonstrations for a second round . as the mild afternoon turned into cold evening , loudspeakers carried the anti-war speeches of numerous speakers , as an estimated 40,000 workers , peace activists and families gathered on east berlin 's former central square . many of the demonstrators lighting candles as evening came were leftovers from student demonstrations held on the square earlier in the day . " we want to animate even more people , " said denise hildebrand , 19 , who together with a group of more than 15 fellow students attended both the school demonstrations and evening demonstrations .
" we want to somehow stir something , to set something in motion . " the start of the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq brought hundreds of thousands onto the streets in european cities from athens to london .
in athens , a record 150,000 marched against the attacks , which began at around 3:35 a.m.
european central time . italy and switzerland saw tens of thousands take to the streets in big cities . law enforcement authorities around europe beefed up their presence around israeli , british and u.s. institutions , and riot police clashed with protestors in several cities . the so-called day x of protests in germany , timed to coincide with the start of the war , was peaceful , with no reported arrests .
in a rehash of slogans from the 1991 gulf war , demonstrators carried placards and banners reading " no blood for oil " and " give peace a chance . " " i 'm against … that they voted for this man " though some protestors in munich shouted " killer , killer ! " as they walked past the american consulate , anti-americanism took a back seat to criticism of the bush government . " i have nothing against the american people .
the only thing i 'm against is that they voted for this man , " said henny frobian , 70 , who was taking part in the alexanderplatz demonstrations . " i belong to the generation that lived through war , " she said .
" we promised each other back then : ' never again war . '
peace was our most important value . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many of germany 's politically active postwar generation came with their children , tying anti-war bandanas onto their heads and outfitting them with mini peace flags . " i 'm , of course , worried about their future as well , " said christiane budde , 41 , watching her 6 and 3-year-old sons as her husband shot photographs .
" i felt really shitty when i went to bed this morning .
i had the feeling i needed to do something .
i 'm human .
i need to be active . " german government has the people 's support though most of the berlin demonstrators doubted that their presence would stop the u.s.-led attack on iraq , they said showing the rest of the world that there was opposition to the war was important nevertheless .
many wanted the german government to know their anti-war stance had the people 's backing . " the reason i 'm here is to show the government that the majority of the germans support them , " said peter schneider , 38 , a computer scientist attending his third anti-war demo .

saddam called on his compatriots to resist , saying , " you will be victorious against your enemies . "
he derided the u.s. attack as " cowardly aggression " intended to drive him from power .
war begins after ultimatum expires the beginning of hostilities came less than two hours after the 48-hour ultimatum that bush gave saddam to leave iraq had expired .
on monday , bush ordered saddam and his sons to go into exile or face war .
" their refusal to do so will result in military conflict , " bush said , " commenced at a time of our choosing . "
according to media reports , that time came after a four-hour meeting bush held with cia director george tenet and pentagon officials , who told the president that he would miss a " target of opportunity " if he did not act immediately .
taken together , the united states and britain have deployed more than 280,000 troops to the persian gulf region in preparation for a war .
other countries , including australia and poland have also contributed a small number of troops to the war effort .
turkey allows u.s. to use its airspace hours after the strikes began , turkey 's parliament voted to allow the u.s. military to use turkish airspace for the war , giving u.s. bombers more room in which to work .
the government-backed proposal will allow u.s. warplanes based in europe or the united states to cross turkey to strike iraq .
the united states could also use turkish airspace to transport troops into northern iraq or to bring supplies to the region .
but the proposal would not allow u.s. planes to use turkish air bases or refuel in turkey .
the united states , for example , will not be able to use incirlik air base , a sprawling facility that houses 50 u.s. fighters used to patrol a no-fly zone over iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

more than 200,000 in germany alone . for many of the thousands of peace demonstrators gathered on berlin 's alexanderplatz on thursday evening , it was a return from earlier demonstrations for a second round . as the mild afternoon turned into cold evening , loudspeakers carried the anti-war speeches of numerous speakers , as an estimated 40,000 workers , peace activists and families gathered on east berlin 's former central square . many of the demonstrators lighting candles as evening came were leftovers from student demonstrations held on the square earlier in the day . " we want to animate even more people , " said denise hildebrand , 19 , who together with a group of more than 15 fellow students attended both the school demonstrations and evening demonstrations .
" we want to somehow stir something , to set something in motion . " the start of the u.s.-led military invasion of iraq brought hundreds of thousands onto the streets in european cities from athens to london .
in athens , a record 150,000 marched against the attacks , which began at around 3:35 a.m.
european central time . italy and switzerland saw tens of thousands take to the streets in big cities . law enforcement authorities around europe beefed up their presence around israeli , british and u.s. institutions , and riot police clashed with protestors in several cities . the so-called day x of protests in germany , timed to coincide with the start of the war , was peaceful , with no reported arrests .
in a rehash of slogans from the 1991 gulf war , demonstrators carried placards and banners reading " no blood for oil " and " give peace a chance . " " i 'm against … that they voted for this man " though some protestors in munich shouted " killer , killer ! " as they walked past the american consulate , anti-americanism took a back seat to criticism of the bush government . " i have nothing against the american people .
the only thing i 'm against is that they voted for this man , " said henny frobian , 70 , who was taking part in the alexanderplatz demonstrations . " i belong to the generation that lived through war , " she said .

" i felt really shitty when i went to bed this morning .
i had the feeling i needed to do something .
i 'm human .
i need to be active . " german government has the people 's support though most of the berlin demonstrators doubted that their presence would stop the u.s.-led attack on iraq , they said showing the rest of the world that there was opposition to the war was important nevertheless .
many wanted the german government to know their anti-war stance had the people 's backing . " the reason i 'm here is to show the government that the majority of the germans support them , " said peter schneider , 38 , a computer scientist attending his third anti-war demo .

it will be of a force and scope and scale that has been beyond what has been seen before , " he said at a news conference .
he called upon iraqi troops to disregard orders from iraq 's leadership .
" the days of the iraqi regime are numbered , " he said .
rumsfeld also announced that three to four oil reservoirs in southern iraq were burning .
u.s.-led strikes begin early thursday the u.s.-led military strike against iraq began in the early hours of thursday at around 3.35 a.m.
central european time with the thunder-like crackling of missiles over the skies of baghdad that lasted about 15 minutes . the white house said the attack marked the " opening stages " of the war to overthrow saddam .
u.s. president bush said that the first phase of the war would be " broad and coordinated " , and that the united states and its 35-nation " coalition of the willing " would seek to avoid civilian casualties .
" american and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm iraq , to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger , " he said the united states had struck " selected targets of military importance " intended to undermine saddam 's ability to wage war .
but the " decapitation " attack seemed to have missed saddam , who appeared later on thursday wearing a uniform and black beret on iraqi television .
saddam called on his compatriots to resist , saying , " you will be victorious against your enemies . "
he derided the u.s. attack as " cowardly aggression " intended to drive him from power .
war begins after ultimatum expires the beginning of hostilities came less than two hours after the 48-hour ultimatum that bush gave saddam to leave iraq had expired .
on monday , bush ordered saddam and his sons to go into exile or face war .
" their refusal to do so will result in military conflict , " bush said , " commenced at a time of our choosing . "
according to media reports , that time came after a four-hour meeting bush held with cia director george tenet and pentagon officials , who told the president that he would miss a " target of opportunity " if he did not act immediately .
taken together , the united states and britain have deployed more than 280,000 troops to the persian gulf region in preparation for a war .
other countries , including australia and poland have also contributed a small number of troops to the war effort .
turkey allows u.s. to use its airspace hours after the strikes began , turkey 's parliament voted to allow the u.s. military to use turkish airspace for the war , giving u.s. bombers more room in which to work .
the government-backed proposal will allow u.s. warplanes based in europe or the united states to cross turkey to strike iraq .
the united states could also use turkish airspace to transport troops into northern iraq or to bring supplies to the region .
but the proposal would not allow u.s. planes to use turkish air bases or refuel in turkey .
the united states , for example , will not be able to use incirlik air base , a sprawling facility that houses 50 u.s. fighters used to patrol a no-fly zone over iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

earlier this year the justice 2 committee called for radical changes to the legal system to ensure that sufferers receive compensation before they die .
msps recommended that special procedures be introduced for handling mesothelioma claims - one of the family of asbestos-related diseases .
scotland 's most senior judge , lord cullen , has now announced changes to the system which will allow fast-track court hearings in personal injury cases for terminally ill people .
shorter timescale under the new procedures , which will take effect on 1 april , all such cases will be set a hearing date within 12 months .
the changes to the court of session 's guidance make clear that where someone has a life expectancy of less than 12 months , the court should look with " considerable sympathy " on any application to resolve the case in a shorter timescale .
committee convener pauline mcneill said : " this important outcome has only been achieved through unprecedented cooperation between the parliament and the judiciary . "
it is now essential that solicitors bringing forward such cases use the flexibility in the new rules to the full " pauline mcneill committee convener " the spirit of the new policy is to make sure that terminally ill people have the best opportunity possible of seeing justice done in civil courts . "
the committee had proposed that such cases should be heard within six months .
" i am reassured that for the more straightforward cases that would be possible under the new rules and any of these cases can now be completed in less than the 12 months originally proposed , " added ms mcneill .
" it is now essential that solicitors bringing forward such cases use the flexibility in the new rules to the full in order to benefit sufferers and their families . "
