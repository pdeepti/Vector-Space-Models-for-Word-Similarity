it ’ s not enough for your clothes to just look good anymore .
the coming trend in german and other european markets is intelligent clothing – active , functional garments that promise a brave , new world of fashion . an exhibition of intelligent clothing is underway in paris until sunday , showing visitors what they could be wearing in the not too distant future .
imagine a blouse that responds to an increase in body temperature by automatically shortening the sleeves . or a dress that changes color to signal your emotional state . how about a suit with a herbal fragrance in its microfibres that works as an anti-stress agent ?
these items already exist , albeit as prototypes . functional fashion but they ’ re the more frivolous results of research into clothing developed for medical or military reasons . research into hypothermia , for example , brought about the development of swimsuits that change color with the temperature to provide a built-in hazard warning . and research into bullet-proof clothing has resulted in an ultra-thin carbon fibre jacket called no-violence , designed to withstand .45 bullets .
in addition to clothing made of high-tech fibres , there are also garments made of normal fabric that incorporate electronics such as computers , radios and phones , connected by hidden cables .
bye bye walkman a practical application already exists in the sports market .
the munich-based infineon ag has created a jogging outfit with an mp3 player in the sleeve , activated by voice command through a tiny microphone embedded in the suit ’ s collar .
for female joggers , triumph international , also based in munich , has introduced a special bra with a “ pulse beat , ” – a device that measures heart beats .
women can monitor their heart rate in combination with a watch-like receiver to make sure they don ’ t overdo their exercise . a similar function is at the core of intelligent biomedical clothing being developed by philips research in aachen , germany . scientists there have invented a wireless , wearable monitoring system that can warn patients with health problems . “ biomedical clothing is potentially a big market , ” koen joosse of philips told deutsche welle .
“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .
but a survey carried out by the independent hohenstein research institute near stuttgart suggests the market is small and focused .
only six percent of those asked said they would buy smart clothes as soon as they came on the market .
the majority said they would prefer to wait a while before trying out the new garments . and perhaps with the exception of athletes such as snowboarders or joggers , who are keen to have mp3 players integrated into their clothing , most respondents were not enthused about the idea of wearing electronic gadgets .
the response was more positive when it came to clothing with a medical function , with 49 percent saying they would want garments that control body functions , such as heart beat or insulin levels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from the jailhouse to the runway stuck for a new look this summer ?

gulbuddin hekmatyar said germany is making a " bad mistake " expanding its troop presence from kabul into northern afghanistan .
the 450 german soldiers are the first expansion of the u.n.-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
" we do n't know what the eu wants to gain by taking the side of the u.s. aggression in afghanistan , " hekmatyar said in a statement quoted by the afghanistan press agency .
u.s. begins operation against warlord unlike other warlords in afghanistan , hekmatyar never swore allegiance to karzai 's kabul government , considering it a puppet of the united states .
the northeastern area of afghanistan where he rules is considered one of the strongs pockets of resistance , according to international military officials .
u.s. military forces began attacking fighters loyal to hekmatyar , al qaeda and the taliban in a large operation this week .
german soldiers are charged with bringing stability to kunduz , where they began arriving in october .

ambassador urges for further expansion germany 's u.n. ambassador gunter pleuger told the security council tuesday afternoon that paramilitary groups , warlords and the growing opium trade are seriously affecting stability in other parts of the country .
pleuger led a delegation of 15 diplomats through kabul last week and said that all told him that the bundeswehr expansion to kunduz was not enough .
" major challenges lie ahead and much remains to be done if the peace process is to become irreversible and security in afghanistan realized , " pleuger told other members of the security council in new york on tuesday , the day before the second anniversary of kabul 's liberation from the taliban .
as if to emphasize his point , a car bomb exploded outside the u.n. compound in the southern city of kandahar tuesday .
an afghani driving by on a motorcycle was injured , but no one was killed .
a romanian soldier taking part in the isaf was killed when his brigade came under fire .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.11.2003 german press review : why hohmann has to go german editorial writers on wednesday continued to comment on the christian democratic union ’ s struggle to expel right-wing backbencher martin hohmann after he called jews a “ race of perpetrators ” in a recent speech . the stuttgarter nachrichten observed that even the most conservative of parliamentarians will give their nod to hohmann ’ s expulsion in a special meeting set for friday , for reasons of self-interest if nothing else .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has to ensure that its programs aren ’ t generally suspected of being radically rightwing because of this association with the hohmann affair , the paper said .
the süddeutsche zeitung wanted an explanation for why a week ago , hohmann was allowed to stay in the party , but now suddenly , he has to go . “ from the top down , the cdu is stuttering through convoluted explanations , ” says the munich paper , “ it lacks the simple courage to say that it ’ s separating from hohmann not because of some deep insight , but because it was driven to it . ”
the b.z. of berlin said anyone sowing hatred has no place in a democratic party .
“ all people deserve protection , ” it wrote , and added : “ germans , foreigners , christians , jews , handicapped , women , gays - anyone insulting or injuring any such people violates all of humanity . ”
the kieler nachrichten commented on germany ’ s latest transport of nuclear waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a storage facility in the rural village of gorleben in the north of the country .
the shipment was again accompanied by massive protests by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
“ the only purpose of the protest action is to provoke and tweak the government , ” the paper argued , and said that a stable democracy has to be able to absorb that kind of expression of opinion . but it thought that the repetitive spectacle would be more tolerable if the protesters didn ’ t fully ignore the reality that germany has no other option but to take its atomic waste back .
cologne ’ s express turned its attention to the state of german pharmaceuticals giant bayer following the announcement that the company plans to sell off its chemicals unit as part of overall restructuring .

does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .
but if space is declared a " shared competence , " more control could be handed over to the european commission .

does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.11.2003 eu to expand space program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this galileo satellite is just the start : the eu plans to invest more in space the eu is setting its sights on space .
does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .
but if space is declared a " shared competence , " more control could be handed over to the european commission .
so the eu may be heading into space , but who will be sitting in the driver 's seat and who will pay the bills remain to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key meeting sheds light on german space program the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.11.2003 german press review : why hohmann has to go german editorial writers on wednesday continued to comment on the christian democratic union ’ s struggle to expel right-wing backbencher martin hohmann after he called jews a “ race of perpetrators ” in a recent speech . the stuttgarter nachrichten observed that even the most conservative of parliamentarians will give their nod to hohmann ’ s expulsion in a special meeting set for friday , for reasons of self-interest if nothing else .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has to ensure that its programs aren ’ t generally suspected of being radically rightwing because of this association with the hohmann affair , the paper said .
the süddeutsche zeitung wanted an explanation for why a week ago , hohmann was allowed to stay in the party , but now suddenly , he has to go . “ from the top down , the cdu is stuttering through convoluted explanations , ” says the munich paper , “ it lacks the simple courage to say that it ’ s separating from hohmann not because of some deep insight , but because it was driven to it . ”
the b.z. of berlin said anyone sowing hatred has no place in a democratic party .
“ all people deserve protection , ” it wrote , and added : “ germans , foreigners , christians , jews , handicapped , women , gays - anyone insulting or injuring any such people violates all of humanity . ”
the kieler nachrichten commented on germany ’ s latest transport of nuclear waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a storage facility in the rural village of gorleben in the north of the country .
the shipment was again accompanied by massive protests by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
“ the only purpose of the protest action is to provoke and tweak the government , ” the paper argued , and said that a stable democracy has to be able to absorb that kind of expression of opinion . but it thought that the repetitive spectacle would be more tolerable if the protesters didn ’ t fully ignore the reality that germany has no other option but to take its atomic waste back .
cologne ’ s express turned its attention to the state of german pharmaceuticals giant bayer following the announcement that the company plans to sell off its chemicals unit as part of overall restructuring .
“ the giant is teetering , ” the paper commented .
for the employees who are going to lose their jobs due to the restructuring , it ’ s a painful experience , it wrote , but concluded that bayer ’ s ceo had few options other than restructuring because he has to keep the company afloat in the face of global competition .
the westdeutsche zeitung in düsseldorf predicted that even after the split from its chemicals unit , bayer will be walking a tightrope for a while yet , as no one knows how much the scandal over its cholesterol-lowering drug lipobay , or baycol as it is known in the u.s. , will cost the company in damages . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .
but if space is declared a " shared competence , " more control could be handed over to the european commission .

these items already exist , albeit as prototypes . functional fashion but they ’ re the more frivolous results of research into clothing developed for medical or military reasons . research into hypothermia , for example , brought about the development of swimsuits that change color with the temperature to provide a built-in hazard warning . and research into bullet-proof clothing has resulted in an ultra-thin carbon fibre jacket called no-violence , designed to withstand .45 bullets .

the munich-based infineon ag has created a jogging outfit with an mp3 player in the sleeve , activated by voice command through a tiny microphone embedded in the suit ’ s collar .

women can monitor their heart rate in combination with a watch-like receiver to make sure they don ’ t overdo their exercise . a similar function is at the core of intelligent biomedical clothing being developed by philips research in aachen , germany . scientists there have invented a wireless , wearable monitoring system that can warn patients with health problems . “ biomedical clothing is potentially a big market , ” koen joosse of philips told deutsche welle .
“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .

only six percent of those asked said they would buy smart clothes as soon as they came on the market .
the majority said they would prefer to wait a while before trying out the new garments . and perhaps with the exception of athletes such as snowboarders or joggers , who are keen to have mp3 players integrated into their clothing , most respondents were not enthused about the idea of wearing electronic gadgets .

germany 's un ambassador said that " major challenges " lie ahead for afghanistan as a renegade warlord threatened german soldiers beginning peacekeeping duties in kunduz . the german bundeswehr soldiers arriving in the northeastern city of kunduz these past few weeks have gotten a rude greeting from the warlord experts say works most to undermine the government of afghan president hamid karzai .

the 450 german soldiers are the first expansion of the u.n.-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
" we do n't know what the eu wants to gain by taking the side of the u.s. aggression in afghanistan , " hekmatyar said in a statement quoted by the afghanistan press agency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.11.2003 eu to expand space program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this galileo satellite is just the start : the eu plans to invest more in space the eu is setting its sights on space .
does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .
but if space is declared a " shared competence , " more control could be handed over to the european commission .
so the eu may be heading into space , but who will be sitting in the driver 's seat and who will pay the bills remain to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key meeting sheds light on german space program the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program .

but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.11.2003 german press review : why hohmann has to go german editorial writers on wednesday continued to comment on the christian democratic union ’ s struggle to expel right-wing backbencher martin hohmann after he called jews a “ race of perpetrators ” in a recent speech . the stuttgarter nachrichten observed that even the most conservative of parliamentarians will give their nod to hohmann ’ s expulsion in a special meeting set for friday , for reasons of self-interest if nothing else .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has to ensure that its programs aren ’ t generally suspected of being radically rightwing because of this association with the hohmann affair , the paper said .
the süddeutsche zeitung wanted an explanation for why a week ago , hohmann was allowed to stay in the party , but now suddenly , he has to go . “ from the top down , the cdu is stuttering through convoluted explanations , ” says the munich paper , “ it lacks the simple courage to say that it ’ s separating from hohmann not because of some deep insight , but because it was driven to it . ”
the b.z. of berlin said anyone sowing hatred has no place in a democratic party .
“ all people deserve protection , ” it wrote , and added : “ germans , foreigners , christians , jews , handicapped , women , gays - anyone insulting or injuring any such people violates all of humanity . ”
the kieler nachrichten commented on germany ’ s latest transport of nuclear waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a storage facility in the rural village of gorleben in the north of the country .
the shipment was again accompanied by massive protests by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
“ the only purpose of the protest action is to provoke and tweak the government , ” the paper argued , and said that a stable democracy has to be able to absorb that kind of expression of opinion . but it thought that the repetitive spectacle would be more tolerable if the protesters didn ’ t fully ignore the reality that germany has no other option but to take its atomic waste back .
cologne ’ s express turned its attention to the state of german pharmaceuticals giant bayer following the announcement that the company plans to sell off its chemicals unit as part of overall restructuring .
“ the giant is teetering , ” the paper commented .
for the employees who are going to lose their jobs due to the restructuring , it ’ s a painful experience , it wrote , but concluded that bayer ’ s ceo had few options other than restructuring because he has to keep the company afloat in the face of global competition .
the westdeutsche zeitung in düsseldorf predicted that even after the split from its chemicals unit , bayer will be walking a tightrope for a while yet , as no one knows how much the scandal over its cholesterol-lowering drug lipobay , or baycol as it is known in the u.s. , will cost the company in damages . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

these items already exist , albeit as prototypes . functional fashion but they ’ re the more frivolous results of research into clothing developed for medical or military reasons . research into hypothermia , for example , brought about the development of swimsuits that change color with the temperature to provide a built-in hazard warning . and research into bullet-proof clothing has resulted in an ultra-thin carbon fibre jacket called no-violence , designed to withstand .45 bullets .
in addition to clothing made of high-tech fibres , there are also garments made of normal fabric that incorporate electronics such as computers , radios and phones , connected by hidden cables .
bye bye walkman a practical application already exists in the sports market .
the munich-based infineon ag has created a jogging outfit with an mp3 player in the sleeve , activated by voice command through a tiny microphone embedded in the suit ’ s collar .
for female joggers , triumph international , also based in munich , has introduced a special bra with a “ pulse beat , ” – a device that measures heart beats .
women can monitor their heart rate in combination with a watch-like receiver to make sure they don ’ t overdo their exercise . a similar function is at the core of intelligent biomedical clothing being developed by philips research in aachen , germany . scientists there have invented a wireless , wearable monitoring system that can warn patients with health problems . “ biomedical clothing is potentially a big market , ” koen joosse of philips told deutsche welle .
“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .
but a survey carried out by the independent hohenstein research institute near stuttgart suggests the market is small and focused .
only six percent of those asked said they would buy smart clothes as soon as they came on the market .
the majority said they would prefer to wait a while before trying out the new garments . and perhaps with the exception of athletes such as snowboarders or joggers , who are keen to have mp3 players integrated into their clothing , most respondents were not enthused about the idea of wearing electronic gadgets .
the response was more positive when it came to clothing with a medical function , with 49 percent saying they would want garments that control body functions , such as heart beat or insulin levels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from the jailhouse to the runway stuck for a new look this summer ?

does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .

not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .
but if space is declared a " shared competence , " more control could be handed over to the european commission .
so the eu may be heading into space , but who will be sitting in the driver 's seat and who will pay the bills remain to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key meeting sheds light on german space program the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program .

the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has to ensure that its programs aren ’ t generally suspected of being radically rightwing because of this association with the hohmann affair , the paper said .
the süddeutsche zeitung wanted an explanation for why a week ago , hohmann was allowed to stay in the party , but now suddenly , he has to go . “ from the top down , the cdu is stuttering through convoluted explanations , ” says the munich paper , “ it lacks the simple courage to say that it ’ s separating from hohmann not because of some deep insight , but because it was driven to it . ”
the b.z. of berlin said anyone sowing hatred has no place in a democratic party .
“ all people deserve protection , ” it wrote , and added : “ germans , foreigners , christians , jews , handicapped , women , gays - anyone insulting or injuring any such people violates all of humanity . ”
the kieler nachrichten commented on germany ’ s latest transport of nuclear waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a storage facility in the rural village of gorleben in the north of the country .
the shipment was again accompanied by massive protests by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
“ the only purpose of the protest action is to provoke and tweak the government , ” the paper argued , and said that a stable democracy has to be able to absorb that kind of expression of opinion . but it thought that the repetitive spectacle would be more tolerable if the protesters didn ’ t fully ignore the reality that germany has no other option but to take its atomic waste back .
cologne ’ s express turned its attention to the state of german pharmaceuticals giant bayer following the announcement that the company plans to sell off its chemicals unit as part of overall restructuring .
“ the giant is teetering , ” the paper commented .
for the employees who are going to lose their jobs due to the restructuring , it ’ s a painful experience , it wrote , but concluded that bayer ’ s ceo had few options other than restructuring because he has to keep the company afloat in the face of global competition .
the westdeutsche zeitung in düsseldorf predicted that even after the split from its chemicals unit , bayer will be walking a tightrope for a while yet , as no one knows how much the scandal over its cholesterol-lowering drug lipobay , or baycol as it is known in the u.s. , will cost the company in damages . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.11.2003 german press review : why hohmann has to go german editorial writers on wednesday continued to comment on the christian democratic union ’ s struggle to expel right-wing backbencher martin hohmann after he called jews a “ race of perpetrators ” in a recent speech . the stuttgarter nachrichten observed that even the most conservative of parliamentarians will give their nod to hohmann ’ s expulsion in a special meeting set for friday , for reasons of self-interest if nothing else .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has to ensure that its programs aren ’ t generally suspected of being radically rightwing because of this association with the hohmann affair , the paper said .
the süddeutsche zeitung wanted an explanation for why a week ago , hohmann was allowed to stay in the party , but now suddenly , he has to go . “ from the top down , the cdu is stuttering through convoluted explanations , ” says the munich paper , “ it lacks the simple courage to say that it ’ s separating from hohmann not because of some deep insight , but because it was driven to it . ”
the b.z. of berlin said anyone sowing hatred has no place in a democratic party .
“ all people deserve protection , ” it wrote , and added : “ germans , foreigners , christians , jews , handicapped , women , gays - anyone insulting or injuring any such people violates all of humanity . ”
the kieler nachrichten commented on germany ’ s latest transport of nuclear waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a storage facility in the rural village of gorleben in the north of the country .
the shipment was again accompanied by massive protests by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
“ the only purpose of the protest action is to provoke and tweak the government , ” the paper argued , and said that a stable democracy has to be able to absorb that kind of expression of opinion . but it thought that the repetitive spectacle would be more tolerable if the protesters didn ’ t fully ignore the reality that germany has no other option but to take its atomic waste back .
cologne ’ s express turned its attention to the state of german pharmaceuticals giant bayer following the announcement that the company plans to sell off its chemicals unit as part of overall restructuring .
“ the giant is teetering , ” the paper commented .
for the employees who are going to lose their jobs due to the restructuring , it ’ s a painful experience , it wrote , but concluded that bayer ’ s ceo had few options other than restructuring because he has to keep the company afloat in the face of global competition .
the westdeutsche zeitung in düsseldorf predicted that even after the split from its chemicals unit , bayer will be walking a tightrope for a while yet , as no one knows how much the scandal over its cholesterol-lowering drug lipobay , or baycol as it is known in the u.s. , will cost the company in damages . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it ’ s not enough for your clothes to just look good anymore .
the coming trend in german and other european markets is intelligent clothing – active , functional garments that promise a brave , new world of fashion . an exhibition of intelligent clothing is underway in paris until sunday , showing visitors what they could be wearing in the not too distant future .
imagine a blouse that responds to an increase in body temperature by automatically shortening the sleeves . or a dress that changes color to signal your emotional state . how about a suit with a herbal fragrance in its microfibres that works as an anti-stress agent ?
these items already exist , albeit as prototypes . functional fashion but they ’ re the more frivolous results of research into clothing developed for medical or military reasons . research into hypothermia , for example , brought about the development of swimsuits that change color with the temperature to provide a built-in hazard warning . and research into bullet-proof clothing has resulted in an ultra-thin carbon fibre jacket called no-violence , designed to withstand .45 bullets .
in addition to clothing made of high-tech fibres , there are also garments made of normal fabric that incorporate electronics such as computers , radios and phones , connected by hidden cables .
bye bye walkman a practical application already exists in the sports market .
the munich-based infineon ag has created a jogging outfit with an mp3 player in the sleeve , activated by voice command through a tiny microphone embedded in the suit ’ s collar .
for female joggers , triumph international , also based in munich , has introduced a special bra with a “ pulse beat , ” – a device that measures heart beats .
women can monitor their heart rate in combination with a watch-like receiver to make sure they don ’ t overdo their exercise . a similar function is at the core of intelligent biomedical clothing being developed by philips research in aachen , germany . scientists there have invented a wireless , wearable monitoring system that can warn patients with health problems . “ biomedical clothing is potentially a big market , ” koen joosse of philips told deutsche welle .
“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .
but a survey carried out by the independent hohenstein research institute near stuttgart suggests the market is small and focused .
only six percent of those asked said they would buy smart clothes as soon as they came on the market .
the majority said they would prefer to wait a while before trying out the new garments . and perhaps with the exception of athletes such as snowboarders or joggers , who are keen to have mp3 players integrated into their clothing , most respondents were not enthused about the idea of wearing electronic gadgets .
the response was more positive when it came to clothing with a medical function , with 49 percent saying they would want garments that control body functions , such as heart beat or insulin levels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from the jailhouse to the runway stuck for a new look this summer ?

it ’ s not enough for your clothes to just look good anymore .
the coming trend in german and other european markets is intelligent clothing – active , functional garments that promise a brave , new world of fashion . an exhibition of intelligent clothing is underway in paris until sunday , showing visitors what they could be wearing in the not too distant future .

these items already exist , albeit as prototypes . functional fashion but they ’ re the more frivolous results of research into clothing developed for medical or military reasons . research into hypothermia , for example , brought about the development of swimsuits that change color with the temperature to provide a built-in hazard warning . and research into bullet-proof clothing has resulted in an ultra-thin carbon fibre jacket called no-violence , designed to withstand .45 bullets .

women can monitor their heart rate in combination with a watch-like receiver to make sure they don ’ t overdo their exercise . a similar function is at the core of intelligent biomedical clothing being developed by philips research in aachen , germany . scientists there have invented a wireless , wearable monitoring system that can warn patients with health problems . “ biomedical clothing is potentially a big market , ” koen joosse of philips told deutsche welle .
“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .

does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .

according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .

does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .
but if space is declared a " shared competence , " more control could be handed over to the european commission .
so the eu may be heading into space , but who will be sitting in the driver 's seat and who will pay the bills remain to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key meeting sheds light on german space program the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program .

“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .

these items already exist , albeit as prototypes . functional fashion but they ’ re the more frivolous results of research into clothing developed for medical or military reasons . research into hypothermia , for example , brought about the development of swimsuits that change color with the temperature to provide a built-in hazard warning . and research into bullet-proof clothing has resulted in an ultra-thin carbon fibre jacket called no-violence , designed to withstand .45 bullets .
in addition to clothing made of high-tech fibres , there are also garments made of normal fabric that incorporate electronics such as computers , radios and phones , connected by hidden cables .
bye bye walkman a practical application already exists in the sports market .
the munich-based infineon ag has created a jogging outfit with an mp3 player in the sleeve , activated by voice command through a tiny microphone embedded in the suit ’ s collar .
for female joggers , triumph international , also based in munich , has introduced a special bra with a “ pulse beat , ” – a device that measures heart beats .
women can monitor their heart rate in combination with a watch-like receiver to make sure they don ’ t overdo their exercise . a similar function is at the core of intelligent biomedical clothing being developed by philips research in aachen , germany . scientists there have invented a wireless , wearable monitoring system that can warn patients with health problems . “ biomedical clothing is potentially a big market , ” koen joosse of philips told deutsche welle .
“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .
but a survey carried out by the independent hohenstein research institute near stuttgart suggests the market is small and focused .
only six percent of those asked said they would buy smart clothes as soon as they came on the market .
the majority said they would prefer to wait a while before trying out the new garments . and perhaps with the exception of athletes such as snowboarders or joggers , who are keen to have mp3 players integrated into their clothing , most respondents were not enthused about the idea of wearing electronic gadgets .
the response was more positive when it came to clothing with a medical function , with 49 percent saying they would want garments that control body functions , such as heart beat or insulin levels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from the jailhouse to the runway stuck for a new look this summer ?

the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has to ensure that its programs aren ’ t generally suspected of being radically rightwing because of this association with the hohmann affair , the paper said .
the süddeutsche zeitung wanted an explanation for why a week ago , hohmann was allowed to stay in the party , but now suddenly , he has to go . “ from the top down , the cdu is stuttering through convoluted explanations , ” says the munich paper , “ it lacks the simple courage to say that it ’ s separating from hohmann not because of some deep insight , but because it was driven to it . ”
the b.z. of berlin said anyone sowing hatred has no place in a democratic party .
“ all people deserve protection , ” it wrote , and added : “ germans , foreigners , christians , jews , handicapped , women , gays - anyone insulting or injuring any such people violates all of humanity . ”
the kieler nachrichten commented on germany ’ s latest transport of nuclear waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a storage facility in the rural village of gorleben in the north of the country .
the shipment was again accompanied by massive protests by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
“ the only purpose of the protest action is to provoke and tweak the government , ” the paper argued , and said that a stable democracy has to be able to absorb that kind of expression of opinion . but it thought that the repetitive spectacle would be more tolerable if the protesters didn ’ t fully ignore the reality that germany has no other option but to take its atomic waste back .
cologne ’ s express turned its attention to the state of german pharmaceuticals giant bayer following the announcement that the company plans to sell off its chemicals unit as part of overall restructuring .
“ the giant is teetering , ” the paper commented .
for the employees who are going to lose their jobs due to the restructuring , it ’ s a painful experience , it wrote , but concluded that bayer ’ s ceo had few options other than restructuring because he has to keep the company afloat in the face of global competition .
the westdeutsche zeitung in düsseldorf predicted that even after the split from its chemicals unit , bayer will be walking a tightrope for a while yet , as no one knows how much the scandal over its cholesterol-lowering drug lipobay , or baycol as it is known in the u.s. , will cost the company in damages . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .
but if space is declared a " shared competence , " more control could be handed over to the european commission .
so the eu may be heading into space , but who will be sitting in the driver 's seat and who will pay the bills remain to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key meeting sheds light on german space program the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program .

it ’ s not enough for your clothes to just look good anymore .
the coming trend in german and other european markets is intelligent clothing – active , functional garments that promise a brave , new world of fashion . an exhibition of intelligent clothing is underway in paris until sunday , showing visitors what they could be wearing in the not too distant future .
imagine a blouse that responds to an increase in body temperature by automatically shortening the sleeves . or a dress that changes color to signal your emotional state . how about a suit with a herbal fragrance in its microfibres that works as an anti-stress agent ?
these items already exist , albeit as prototypes . functional fashion but they ’ re the more frivolous results of research into clothing developed for medical or military reasons . research into hypothermia , for example , brought about the development of swimsuits that change color with the temperature to provide a built-in hazard warning . and research into bullet-proof clothing has resulted in an ultra-thin carbon fibre jacket called no-violence , designed to withstand .45 bullets .
in addition to clothing made of high-tech fibres , there are also garments made of normal fabric that incorporate electronics such as computers , radios and phones , connected by hidden cables .
bye bye walkman a practical application already exists in the sports market .
the munich-based infineon ag has created a jogging outfit with an mp3 player in the sleeve , activated by voice command through a tiny microphone embedded in the suit ’ s collar .
for female joggers , triumph international , also based in munich , has introduced a special bra with a “ pulse beat , ” – a device that measures heart beats .
women can monitor their heart rate in combination with a watch-like receiver to make sure they don ’ t overdo their exercise . a similar function is at the core of intelligent biomedical clothing being developed by philips research in aachen , germany . scientists there have invented a wireless , wearable monitoring system that can warn patients with health problems . “ biomedical clothing is potentially a big market , ” koen joosse of philips told deutsche welle .
“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .
but a survey carried out by the independent hohenstein research institute near stuttgart suggests the market is small and focused .
only six percent of those asked said they would buy smart clothes as soon as they came on the market .
the majority said they would prefer to wait a while before trying out the new garments . and perhaps with the exception of athletes such as snowboarders or joggers , who are keen to have mp3 players integrated into their clothing , most respondents were not enthused about the idea of wearing electronic gadgets .
the response was more positive when it came to clothing with a medical function , with 49 percent saying they would want garments that control body functions , such as heart beat or insulin levels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from the jailhouse to the runway stuck for a new look this summer ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.11.2003 german press review : why hohmann has to go german editorial writers on wednesday continued to comment on the christian democratic union ’ s struggle to expel right-wing backbencher martin hohmann after he called jews a “ race of perpetrators ” in a recent speech . the stuttgarter nachrichten observed that even the most conservative of parliamentarians will give their nod to hohmann ’ s expulsion in a special meeting set for friday , for reasons of self-interest if nothing else .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has to ensure that its programs aren ’ t generally suspected of being radically rightwing because of this association with the hohmann affair , the paper said .
the süddeutsche zeitung wanted an explanation for why a week ago , hohmann was allowed to stay in the party , but now suddenly , he has to go . “ from the top down , the cdu is stuttering through convoluted explanations , ” says the munich paper , “ it lacks the simple courage to say that it ’ s separating from hohmann not because of some deep insight , but because it was driven to it . ”
the b.z. of berlin said anyone sowing hatred has no place in a democratic party .
“ all people deserve protection , ” it wrote , and added : “ germans , foreigners , christians , jews , handicapped , women , gays - anyone insulting or injuring any such people violates all of humanity . ”
the kieler nachrichten commented on germany ’ s latest transport of nuclear waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a storage facility in the rural village of gorleben in the north of the country .
the shipment was again accompanied by massive protests by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
“ the only purpose of the protest action is to provoke and tweak the government , ” the paper argued , and said that a stable democracy has to be able to absorb that kind of expression of opinion . but it thought that the repetitive spectacle would be more tolerable if the protesters didn ’ t fully ignore the reality that germany has no other option but to take its atomic waste back .
cologne ’ s express turned its attention to the state of german pharmaceuticals giant bayer following the announcement that the company plans to sell off its chemicals unit as part of overall restructuring .
“ the giant is teetering , ” the paper commented .
for the employees who are going to lose their jobs due to the restructuring , it ’ s a painful experience , it wrote , but concluded that bayer ’ s ceo had few options other than restructuring because he has to keep the company afloat in the face of global competition .
the westdeutsche zeitung in düsseldorf predicted that even after the split from its chemicals unit , bayer will be walking a tightrope for a while yet , as no one knows how much the scandal over its cholesterol-lowering drug lipobay , or baycol as it is known in the u.s. , will cost the company in damages . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.11.2003 eu to expand space program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this galileo satellite is just the start : the eu plans to invest more in space the eu is setting its sights on space .
does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .
but if space is declared a " shared competence , " more control could be handed over to the european commission .
so the eu may be heading into space , but who will be sitting in the driver 's seat and who will pay the bills remain to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key meeting sheds light on german space program the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program .

not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .
but if space is declared a " shared competence , " more control could be handed over to the european commission .
so the eu may be heading into space , but who will be sitting in the driver 's seat and who will pay the bills remain to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key meeting sheds light on german space program the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program .

the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has to ensure that its programs aren ’ t generally suspected of being radically rightwing because of this association with the hohmann affair , the paper said .
the süddeutsche zeitung wanted an explanation for why a week ago , hohmann was allowed to stay in the party , but now suddenly , he has to go . “ from the top down , the cdu is stuttering through convoluted explanations , ” says the munich paper , “ it lacks the simple courage to say that it ’ s separating from hohmann not because of some deep insight , but because it was driven to it . ”

the kieler nachrichten commented on germany ’ s latest transport of nuclear waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a storage facility in the rural village of gorleben in the north of the country .
the shipment was again accompanied by massive protests by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
“ the only purpose of the protest action is to provoke and tweak the government , ” the paper argued , and said that a stable democracy has to be able to absorb that kind of expression of opinion . but it thought that the repetitive spectacle would be more tolerable if the protesters didn ’ t fully ignore the reality that germany has no other option but to take its atomic waste back .

the westdeutsche zeitung in düsseldorf predicted that even after the split from its chemicals unit , bayer will be walking a tightrope for a while yet , as no one knows how much the scandal over its cholesterol-lowering drug lipobay , or baycol as it is known in the u.s. , will cost the company in damages . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it ’ s not enough for your clothes to just look good anymore .
the coming trend in german and other european markets is intelligent clothing – active , functional garments that promise a brave , new world of fashion . an exhibition of intelligent clothing is underway in paris until sunday , showing visitors what they could be wearing in the not too distant future .
imagine a blouse that responds to an increase in body temperature by automatically shortening the sleeves . or a dress that changes color to signal your emotional state . how about a suit with a herbal fragrance in its microfibres that works as an anti-stress agent ?
these items already exist , albeit as prototypes . functional fashion but they ’ re the more frivolous results of research into clothing developed for medical or military reasons . research into hypothermia , for example , brought about the development of swimsuits that change color with the temperature to provide a built-in hazard warning . and research into bullet-proof clothing has resulted in an ultra-thin carbon fibre jacket called no-violence , designed to withstand .45 bullets .
in addition to clothing made of high-tech fibres , there are also garments made of normal fabric that incorporate electronics such as computers , radios and phones , connected by hidden cables .
bye bye walkman a practical application already exists in the sports market .
the munich-based infineon ag has created a jogging outfit with an mp3 player in the sleeve , activated by voice command through a tiny microphone embedded in the suit ’ s collar .
for female joggers , triumph international , also based in munich , has introduced a special bra with a “ pulse beat , ” – a device that measures heart beats .
women can monitor their heart rate in combination with a watch-like receiver to make sure they don ’ t overdo their exercise . a similar function is at the core of intelligent biomedical clothing being developed by philips research in aachen , germany . scientists there have invented a wireless , wearable monitoring system that can warn patients with health problems . “ biomedical clothing is potentially a big market , ” koen joosse of philips told deutsche welle .
“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .
but a survey carried out by the independent hohenstein research institute near stuttgart suggests the market is small and focused .
only six percent of those asked said they would buy smart clothes as soon as they came on the market .
the majority said they would prefer to wait a while before trying out the new garments . and perhaps with the exception of athletes such as snowboarders or joggers , who are keen to have mp3 players integrated into their clothing , most respondents were not enthused about the idea of wearing electronic gadgets .
the response was more positive when it came to clothing with a medical function , with 49 percent saying they would want garments that control body functions , such as heart beat or insulin levels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from the jailhouse to the runway stuck for a new look this summer ?

does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .

according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .

germany 's un ambassador said that " major challenges " lie ahead for afghanistan as a renegade warlord threatened german soldiers beginning peacekeeping duties in kunduz . the german bundeswehr soldiers arriving in the northeastern city of kunduz these past few weeks have gotten a rude greeting from the warlord experts say works most to undermine the government of afghan president hamid karzai .
gulbuddin hekmatyar said germany is making a " bad mistake " expanding its troop presence from kabul into northern afghanistan .
the 450 german soldiers are the first expansion of the u.n.-mandated international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- .
" we do n't know what the eu wants to gain by taking the side of the u.s. aggression in afghanistan , " hekmatyar said in a statement quoted by the afghanistan press agency .
u.s. begins operation against warlord unlike other warlords in afghanistan , hekmatyar never swore allegiance to karzai 's kabul government , considering it a puppet of the united states .
the northeastern area of afghanistan where he rules is considered one of the strongs pockets of resistance , according to international military officials .
u.s. military forces began attacking fighters loyal to hekmatyar , al qaeda and the taliban in a large operation this week .
german soldiers are charged with bringing stability to kunduz , where they began arriving in october .

ambassador urges for further expansion germany 's u.n. ambassador gunter pleuger told the security council tuesday afternoon that paramilitary groups , warlords and the growing opium trade are seriously affecting stability in other parts of the country .
pleuger led a delegation of 15 diplomats through kabul last week and said that all told him that the bundeswehr expansion to kunduz was not enough .
" major challenges lie ahead and much remains to be done if the peace process is to become irreversible and security in afghanistan realized , " pleuger told other members of the security council in new york on tuesday , the day before the second anniversary of kabul 's liberation from the taliban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.11.2003 german press review : why hohmann has to go german editorial writers on wednesday continued to comment on the christian democratic union ’ s struggle to expel right-wing backbencher martin hohmann after he called jews a “ race of perpetrators ” in a recent speech . the stuttgarter nachrichten observed that even the most conservative of parliamentarians will give their nod to hohmann ’ s expulsion in a special meeting set for friday , for reasons of self-interest if nothing else .
the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has to ensure that its programs aren ’ t generally suspected of being radically rightwing because of this association with the hohmann affair , the paper said .
the süddeutsche zeitung wanted an explanation for why a week ago , hohmann was allowed to stay in the party , but now suddenly , he has to go . “ from the top down , the cdu is stuttering through convoluted explanations , ” says the munich paper , “ it lacks the simple courage to say that it ’ s separating from hohmann not because of some deep insight , but because it was driven to it . ”
the b.z. of berlin said anyone sowing hatred has no place in a democratic party .
“ all people deserve protection , ” it wrote , and added : “ germans , foreigners , christians , jews , handicapped , women , gays - anyone insulting or injuring any such people violates all of humanity . ”
the kieler nachrichten commented on germany ’ s latest transport of nuclear waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a storage facility in the rural village of gorleben in the north of the country .
the shipment was again accompanied by massive protests by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
“ the only purpose of the protest action is to provoke and tweak the government , ” the paper argued , and said that a stable democracy has to be able to absorb that kind of expression of opinion . but it thought that the repetitive spectacle would be more tolerable if the protesters didn ’ t fully ignore the reality that germany has no other option but to take its atomic waste back .
cologne ’ s express turned its attention to the state of german pharmaceuticals giant bayer following the announcement that the company plans to sell off its chemicals unit as part of overall restructuring .
“ the giant is teetering , ” the paper commented .
for the employees who are going to lose their jobs due to the restructuring , it ’ s a painful experience , it wrote , but concluded that bayer ’ s ceo had few options other than restructuring because he has to keep the company afloat in the face of global competition .
the westdeutsche zeitung in düsseldorf predicted that even after the split from its chemicals unit , bayer will be walking a tightrope for a while yet , as no one knows how much the scandal over its cholesterol-lowering drug lipobay , or baycol as it is known in the u.s. , will cost the company in damages . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it ’ s not enough for your clothes to just look good anymore .
the coming trend in german and other european markets is intelligent clothing – active , functional garments that promise a brave , new world of fashion . an exhibition of intelligent clothing is underway in paris until sunday , showing visitors what they could be wearing in the not too distant future .
imagine a blouse that responds to an increase in body temperature by automatically shortening the sleeves . or a dress that changes color to signal your emotional state . how about a suit with a herbal fragrance in its microfibres that works as an anti-stress agent ?
these items already exist , albeit as prototypes . functional fashion but they ’ re the more frivolous results of research into clothing developed for medical or military reasons . research into hypothermia , for example , brought about the development of swimsuits that change color with the temperature to provide a built-in hazard warning . and research into bullet-proof clothing has resulted in an ultra-thin carbon fibre jacket called no-violence , designed to withstand .45 bullets .
in addition to clothing made of high-tech fibres , there are also garments made of normal fabric that incorporate electronics such as computers , radios and phones , connected by hidden cables .
bye bye walkman a practical application already exists in the sports market .
the munich-based infineon ag has created a jogging outfit with an mp3 player in the sleeve , activated by voice command through a tiny microphone embedded in the suit ’ s collar .
for female joggers , triumph international , also based in munich , has introduced a special bra with a “ pulse beat , ” – a device that measures heart beats .
women can monitor their heart rate in combination with a watch-like receiver to make sure they don ’ t overdo their exercise . a similar function is at the core of intelligent biomedical clothing being developed by philips research in aachen , germany . scientists there have invented a wireless , wearable monitoring system that can warn patients with health problems . “ biomedical clothing is potentially a big market , ” koen joosse of philips told deutsche welle .
“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .
but a survey carried out by the independent hohenstein research institute near stuttgart suggests the market is small and focused .

it ’ s not enough for your clothes to just look good anymore .
the coming trend in german and other european markets is intelligent clothing – active , functional garments that promise a brave , new world of fashion . an exhibition of intelligent clothing is underway in paris until sunday , showing visitors what they could be wearing in the not too distant future .
imagine a blouse that responds to an increase in body temperature by automatically shortening the sleeves . or a dress that changes color to signal your emotional state . how about a suit with a herbal fragrance in its microfibres that works as an anti-stress agent ?
these items already exist , albeit as prototypes . functional fashion but they ’ re the more frivolous results of research into clothing developed for medical or military reasons . research into hypothermia , for example , brought about the development of swimsuits that change color with the temperature to provide a built-in hazard warning . and research into bullet-proof clothing has resulted in an ultra-thin carbon fibre jacket called no-violence , designed to withstand .45 bullets .
in addition to clothing made of high-tech fibres , there are also garments made of normal fabric that incorporate electronics such as computers , radios and phones , connected by hidden cables .
bye bye walkman a practical application already exists in the sports market .
the munich-based infineon ag has created a jogging outfit with an mp3 player in the sleeve , activated by voice command through a tiny microphone embedded in the suit ’ s collar .
for female joggers , triumph international , also based in munich , has introduced a special bra with a “ pulse beat , ” – a device that measures heart beats .
women can monitor their heart rate in combination with a watch-like receiver to make sure they don ’ t overdo their exercise . a similar function is at the core of intelligent biomedical clothing being developed by philips research in aachen , germany . scientists there have invented a wireless , wearable monitoring system that can warn patients with health problems . “ biomedical clothing is potentially a big market , ” koen joosse of philips told deutsche welle .
“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .
but a survey carried out by the independent hohenstein research institute near stuttgart suggests the market is small and focused .
only six percent of those asked said they would buy smart clothes as soon as they came on the market .
the majority said they would prefer to wait a while before trying out the new garments . and perhaps with the exception of athletes such as snowboarders or joggers , who are keen to have mp3 players integrated into their clothing , most respondents were not enthused about the idea of wearing electronic gadgets .

these items already exist , albeit as prototypes . functional fashion but they ’ re the more frivolous results of research into clothing developed for medical or military reasons . research into hypothermia , for example , brought about the development of swimsuits that change color with the temperature to provide a built-in hazard warning . and research into bullet-proof clothing has resulted in an ultra-thin carbon fibre jacket called no-violence , designed to withstand .45 bullets .
in addition to clothing made of high-tech fibres , there are also garments made of normal fabric that incorporate electronics such as computers , radios and phones , connected by hidden cables .
bye bye walkman a practical application already exists in the sports market .
the munich-based infineon ag has created a jogging outfit with an mp3 player in the sleeve , activated by voice command through a tiny microphone embedded in the suit ’ s collar .
for female joggers , triumph international , also based in munich , has introduced a special bra with a “ pulse beat , ” – a device that measures heart beats .
women can monitor their heart rate in combination with a watch-like receiver to make sure they don ’ t overdo their exercise . a similar function is at the core of intelligent biomedical clothing being developed by philips research in aachen , germany . scientists there have invented a wireless , wearable monitoring system that can warn patients with health problems . “ biomedical clothing is potentially a big market , ” koen joosse of philips told deutsche welle .
“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .
but a survey carried out by the independent hohenstein research institute near stuttgart suggests the market is small and focused .
only six percent of those asked said they would buy smart clothes as soon as they came on the market .
the majority said they would prefer to wait a while before trying out the new garments . and perhaps with the exception of athletes such as snowboarders or joggers , who are keen to have mp3 players integrated into their clothing , most respondents were not enthused about the idea of wearing electronic gadgets .
the response was more positive when it came to clothing with a medical function , with 49 percent saying they would want garments that control body functions , such as heart beat or insulin levels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from the jailhouse to the runway stuck for a new look this summer ?

does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .

according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .

but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .

the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .

does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.11.2003 eu to expand space program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this galileo satellite is just the start : the eu plans to invest more in space the eu is setting its sights on space .
does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .
but if space is declared a " shared competence , " more control could be handed over to the european commission .
so the eu may be heading into space , but who will be sitting in the driver 's seat and who will pay the bills remain to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key meeting sheds light on german space program the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program .

the friends , all in their mid-30s , advertised themselves on the ebay auction website , promising to be the life and soul of any party by turning up with a crate of beer and staying .
" not enough to drink ?
want some new faces ?
too many men ?
empty dance floor ?
party always over by 11pm ?
always the same old dull couples ? " they asked .
" then get into a real party mood with our six pack .
we will personally bring the crate round .
and the best thing is , we 'll stay and party too . "
four other women in their mid-20s are now offering themselves for sale as party guests too , claiming to be a " cellulite-free alternative to the over-30s " .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.11.2003 eu to expand space program großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this galileo satellite is just the start : the eu plans to invest more in space the eu is setting its sights on space .
does that mean launching its own astronaut , as china recently did ?
not likely , but it could mean more jobs and profits for those on the ground . responding to pressure from an ever more competitive space race , the european union will take steps to increase its presence in space , according to a white paper released by the european commission on tuesday .
the paper , which was drawn up by the commission in cooperation with the european space agency -lrb- esa -rrb- , outlines an ambitious plan : eu investment in space-related technology could double over the next ten years .
when asked if this would culminate in efforts to launch an eu astronaut , philippe busquin , the eu commissioner in charge of space research , said , " it 's important to have a serious agenda .
i myself would definitely be in favor . "
but that does not appear to be the top priority of the white paper , which does not even mention such a possibility .
instead , it concentrates on efforts to develop both the civilian and military benefits of space-related technology .
above all , the paper is concerned with securing the eu 's independent access to space .
a space program : it 's good for you space research and space-related technology are a key source of jobs in europe .
in fact , 30,000 eu citizens are currently employed in more than 2,000 space-industry related firms .
and the sector is a growing one .
for example , demand for satellite navigation services and related products is growing by 25 percent a year , and it could be a € 100 billion -lrb- $ 117 billion -rrb- industry by 2010 , creating 40,000 new jobs for skilled europeans .
according to the white paper , every euro invested in space technology yields a turnover of € 7-8 .
thus , if europe wants to remain competitive , so the line of reasoning goes , increased investment is necessary .
" if europe does not adopt the proposed approach to space policy , it will decline as a ' space power ' because of an inability to develop new technologies and sustain applications with serious consequent damage to its overall competitiveness , " the report states .
what 's more , it also suggests that increased technological capacity could be useful to efforts to create a common european foreign and security policy .
busquin concurs .
" the development of europe 's capabilities in satellite communications , global positioning , and earth observation will boost applications and have important social , economic and commercial benefits for europe , " he said on tuesday .
seeking independence europe has often relied on access to satellites and technology controlled by the united states , but over the last few years it has made increased efforts to secure independent access , including the development of the galileo satellite navigation system and the global monitoring and earth observation system -lrb- gmes -rrb- .
the eu currently spends € 5.38 billion on its space policy , which has been growing 2.3 percent per year .
but the european commission thinks the yearly increase needs to be doubled , to 4.6 percent , to achieve its goals .
space , a shared competence the new program will be rolled out in two phases , under the title of the " european space program . "
the first phase will go from 2004-2007 , and activities already agreed upon in the recent framework agreement between the european community and the esa will be instituted , including developing a european space policy .
the second more ambitious phase will launch after 2007 , when it is expected that the new eu constitutions will declare space a shared competence of eu members .
but first , some sticky issues regarding who will control the purse strings need to be sorted out .
the esa , which currently spearheads eu space projects , is an intergovernmental institution , which mean that individual member states control the budget .
but if space is declared a " shared competence , " more control could be handed over to the european commission .
so the eu may be heading into space , but who will be sitting in the driver 's seat and who will pay the bills remain to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de key meeting sheds light on german space program the world 's largest astronautical conference , being held this year in bremen , has put a spotlight on europe 's ambivalent relationship with its space program .

the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has to ensure that its programs aren ’ t generally suspected of being radically rightwing because of this association with the hohmann affair , the paper said .
the süddeutsche zeitung wanted an explanation for why a week ago , hohmann was allowed to stay in the party , but now suddenly , he has to go . “ from the top down , the cdu is stuttering through convoluted explanations , ” says the munich paper , “ it lacks the simple courage to say that it ’ s separating from hohmann not because of some deep insight , but because it was driven to it . ”
the b.z. of berlin said anyone sowing hatred has no place in a democratic party .
“ all people deserve protection , ” it wrote , and added : “ germans , foreigners , christians , jews , handicapped , women , gays - anyone insulting or injuring any such people violates all of humanity . ”
the kieler nachrichten commented on germany ’ s latest transport of nuclear waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a storage facility in the rural village of gorleben in the north of the country .
the shipment was again accompanied by massive protests by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
“ the only purpose of the protest action is to provoke and tweak the government , ” the paper argued , and said that a stable democracy has to be able to absorb that kind of expression of opinion . but it thought that the repetitive spectacle would be more tolerable if the protesters didn ’ t fully ignore the reality that germany has no other option but to take its atomic waste back .
cologne ’ s express turned its attention to the state of german pharmaceuticals giant bayer following the announcement that the company plans to sell off its chemicals unit as part of overall restructuring .
“ the giant is teetering , ” the paper commented .
for the employees who are going to lose their jobs due to the restructuring , it ’ s a painful experience , it wrote , but concluded that bayer ’ s ceo had few options other than restructuring because he has to keep the company afloat in the face of global competition .
the westdeutsche zeitung in düsseldorf predicted that even after the split from its chemicals unit , bayer will be walking a tightrope for a while yet , as no one knows how much the scandal over its cholesterol-lowering drug lipobay , or baycol as it is known in the u.s. , will cost the company in damages . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- has to ensure that its programs aren ’ t generally suspected of being radically rightwing because of this association with the hohmann affair , the paper said .
the süddeutsche zeitung wanted an explanation for why a week ago , hohmann was allowed to stay in the party , but now suddenly , he has to go . “ from the top down , the cdu is stuttering through convoluted explanations , ” says the munich paper , “ it lacks the simple courage to say that it ’ s separating from hohmann not because of some deep insight , but because it was driven to it . ”
the b.z. of berlin said anyone sowing hatred has no place in a democratic party .
“ all people deserve protection , ” it wrote , and added : “ germans , foreigners , christians , jews , handicapped , women , gays - anyone insulting or injuring any such people violates all of humanity . ”
the kieler nachrichten commented on germany ’ s latest transport of nuclear waste from a reprocessing plant in france to a storage facility in the rural village of gorleben in the north of the country .
the shipment was again accompanied by massive protests by anti-nuclear demonstrators .
“ the only purpose of the protest action is to provoke and tweak the government , ” the paper argued , and said that a stable democracy has to be able to absorb that kind of expression of opinion . but it thought that the repetitive spectacle would be more tolerable if the protesters didn ’ t fully ignore the reality that germany has no other option but to take its atomic waste back .
cologne ’ s express turned its attention to the state of german pharmaceuticals giant bayer following the announcement that the company plans to sell off its chemicals unit as part of overall restructuring .
“ the giant is teetering , ” the paper commented .
for the employees who are going to lose their jobs due to the restructuring , it ’ s a painful experience , it wrote , but concluded that bayer ’ s ceo had few options other than restructuring because he has to keep the company afloat in the face of global competition .
the westdeutsche zeitung in düsseldorf predicted that even after the split from its chemicals unit , bayer will be walking a tightrope for a while yet , as no one knows how much the scandal over its cholesterol-lowering drug lipobay , or baycol as it is known in the u.s. , will cost the company in damages . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it ’ s not enough for your clothes to just look good anymore .
the coming trend in german and other european markets is intelligent clothing – active , functional garments that promise a brave , new world of fashion . an exhibition of intelligent clothing is underway in paris until sunday , showing visitors what they could be wearing in the not too distant future .
imagine a blouse that responds to an increase in body temperature by automatically shortening the sleeves . or a dress that changes color to signal your emotional state . how about a suit with a herbal fragrance in its microfibres that works as an anti-stress agent ?
these items already exist , albeit as prototypes . functional fashion but they ’ re the more frivolous results of research into clothing developed for medical or military reasons . research into hypothermia , for example , brought about the development of swimsuits that change color with the temperature to provide a built-in hazard warning . and research into bullet-proof clothing has resulted in an ultra-thin carbon fibre jacket called no-violence , designed to withstand .45 bullets .
in addition to clothing made of high-tech fibres , there are also garments made of normal fabric that incorporate electronics such as computers , radios and phones , connected by hidden cables .
bye bye walkman a practical application already exists in the sports market .
the munich-based infineon ag has created a jogging outfit with an mp3 player in the sleeve , activated by voice command through a tiny microphone embedded in the suit ’ s collar .
for female joggers , triumph international , also based in munich , has introduced a special bra with a “ pulse beat , ” – a device that measures heart beats .
women can monitor their heart rate in combination with a watch-like receiver to make sure they don ’ t overdo their exercise . a similar function is at the core of intelligent biomedical clothing being developed by philips research in aachen , germany . scientists there have invented a wireless , wearable monitoring system that can warn patients with health problems . “ biomedical clothing is potentially a big market , ” koen joosse of philips told deutsche welle .
“ the concept is very useful for people with certain conditions , as continuous heart monitoring isn ’ t available any other way .
the goal is for the monitoring system to be unobtrusive , so the wearer forgets that the clothing also serves a function . ” with the philips system , patients would insert a small , thin technology device into common items of clothing such as bras , briefs or waist belts , and their body signals such as heart activity could be continuously monitored .
but the biomedical clothing is n't being worn yet , said joosse , because although the device and the transmission system are complete , the third component – which involves getting health practitioners onboard – is still in the research stage .
the german company , merhav aap gmbh , has a different concept of clothing with a medical function . they 've invented a “ portable airbag ” system of clothing for horseriders and motorcyclists which inflates in 30 milliseconds to protect the neck and spine , areas most vulnerable in a collision . consumers wary the range of intelligent clothing currently available to consumers is relatively small , so there ’ s little in the way of consumer reaction .
but a survey carried out by the independent hohenstein research institute near stuttgart suggests the market is small and focused .
only six percent of those asked said they would buy smart clothes as soon as they came on the market .
the majority said they would prefer to wait a while before trying out the new garments . and perhaps with the exception of athletes such as snowboarders or joggers , who are keen to have mp3 players integrated into their clothing , most respondents were not enthused about the idea of wearing electronic gadgets .
the response was more positive when it came to clothing with a medical function , with 49 percent saying they would want garments that control body functions , such as heart beat or insulin levels . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de from the jailhouse to the runway stuck for a new look this summer ?

the national audit office -lrb- nao -rrb- says the schemes for tracking animal movements do help guard public health .
but after finding evidence of errors and incomplete records , it argues the way data is collected needs improving .
inaccurate information and missed deadlines for records costs the government about £ 15m a year , it says .

the nao report centres on the cattle tracing system , run by the government , and the animal movements licensing system , operated by local councils .
the watchdog found that a quarter of postal applications for cattle passports included an error , while movement records for one animal in eight were incomplete .
that means the current location of 2 % of cattle is uncertain .
nao head sir john bourn said : " information on the movement of animals around the country is of vital importance in the fight to prevent the spread of animal disease , all the more so when there is a serious outbreak .

from 2007/8 all new passports and driving licences will include details such as eye recognition and fingerprints , said the home secretary .
ministers say most people will have one of the voluntary documents by 2013 and then it could be made compulsory .
mr blunkett says the scheme is vital for fighting benefit fraud , immigration abuse and terrorism .
new tory home affairs spokesman david davis said the timescale for the introduction of the cards was a " 10-year deferral " forced by cabinet splits over the issue .
the result was a " half-baked " plan , he said , pointing to the disparity of people not having to carry cards but being stopped by police .
" if you are a law-abiding innocent man , you turn up three or four days later , if you are a criminal or illegal immigrant , you disappear into the undergrowth , " he said .
under the plans people wanting to use the nhs , claim benefits or get a job would have to produce a valid card .
basic information ?
prime minister tony blair said the public understood the need to contemplate such schemes .
he told reporters : " it is important to realise that we live in a quite different world today .
there is a real security threat . "
id cards - key facts from 2007-2008 new passports and driving licences will include biometric data by 2013 it is estimated 80 % of adults will have biometric passports or driving licences 4.6m foreign nationals living in uk among first to register on database from 2007-2008 .
introduction of separate id cards from 2007/8 costs of setting up the system over next three years £ 186m the total cost will be £ 3bn mr blunkett said a national identity register would hold details of 60m people in the uk .
while people would not be compelled to carry their id , mr blunkett indicated mobile technology was on the way which could allow police on streets to check people 's id by checking their fingerprints or eye scans .
he said " minimal internal controls and strong borders " were no longer enough .
" an id card is not a luxury or a whim - it is a necessity , " he said .
" i know some people believe there is a sinister motive behind the cards ; that they will be part of a big brother state .
" this is wrong - only basic information will be held on the id card database - such as your name , address , birthday and sex .
" it will not have details of religion , political beliefs , marital status or your health records . "
mr blunkett claimed independent research showed eight out of 10 members of the public backed id cards .
but his lib dem opposite number , mark oaten , suggested that 5,000 unfavourable consultation responses had been not been counted as they had been submitted through an anti-id card website .
the money earmarked for the id card scheme would be better spent on more police , argued mr oaten .
in his interview with today , mr blunkett gave an insight into cabinet divisions over id cards . "
we avoided me becoming the barbara castle of 2003 " david blunkett the home secretary likened the opposition he faced from fellow ministers to that experienced by barbara castle when she tried to overhaul industrial relations in the 1960s .
she was thwarted by cabinet colleagues but the failure to tackle union power led to labour losing the 1979 election , he said .
clandestine the uk 's most senior police officer said at the weekend that although he used to be against the idea of compulsory id cards , he now believed they were " essential " in the fight against terrorism .
countries with id cards belgium france germany netherlands portugal sir john stevens , head of the metropolitan police service , said they should be introduced urgently .
but there is opposition from among labour mps .
as well as civil liberties concerns , former home office minister barbara roche said the scheme would cost a lot without necessarily being a valuable weapon against crime .

the committee behind london 's bid says the proposals not only meet athletes ' needs , but will drive a massive regeneration programme in one of london 's poorest areas .
a giant stadium in marshgate lane and an olympic village with 17,000 beds - which will be turned into 5,000 homes once the games have finished - were among plans revealed on tuesday .
other proposals include an aquatic centre with a 50-metre pool , a velodrome and bmx track and a complex for basketball and volleyball events and the paralympics .
the plans will now go to public consultation before being submitted to the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which will decide in 2005 which city will host the games .
proposals 80,000-seat stadium , marshgate lane aquatic centre with 50m pool , carpenters road velodrome and bmx track next to eastway cycling centre multi-sport complex on old hackney greyhound stadium olympic village near stratford rail terminal tennis complex next to fish island hockey complex next to olympic village london 's 2012 bid chief executive keith mills said plans for a " compact games " , with many events within walking distance of the olympic village , left the bid in " great shape " .
he said the new venues would drive the lower lea valley into " the most extensive transformation london has seen since the victorian era " .
" getting the athletes to their venues quickly is a high priority and we have designed this plan so two thirds of the athletes can get to their sport in 15 minutes , " he said .
but the layout would also meet the long-term needs of london residents once the olympics was over .
our ambition is that the 2012 olympics are remembered not only as the best olympic games so far , but also as the event which brought long lasting benefits to all londoners london assembly report and although the central precinct is planned for stratford , three miles from the heart of london , events would be held across the city and the rest of the country , he added .
london is in competition with new york , paris , madrid , leipzig and moscow to host the event .
suggestions the tennis contest could be held at wimbledon may not now make it past the drawing board .
barbara cassani , who is chairing the london bid , admits the all-england tennis club may not form part of the plans because grass would not be considered appropriate for disabled athletes , who will be competing in the paralympics .

the committee behind london 's bid says the proposals not only meet athletes ' needs , but will drive a massive regeneration programme in one of london 's poorest areas .
a giant stadium in marshgate lane and an olympic village with 17,000 beds - which will be turned into 5,000 homes once the games have finished - were among plans revealed on tuesday .
other proposals include an aquatic centre with a 50-metre pool , a velodrome and bmx track and a complex for basketball and volleyball events and the paralympics .
the plans will now go to public consultation before being submitted to the international olympic committee -lrb- ioc -rrb- , which will decide in 2005 which city will host the games .

" getting the athletes to their venues quickly is a high priority and we have designed this plan so two thirds of the athletes can get to their sport in 15 minutes , " he said .

london is in competition with new york , paris , madrid , leipzig and moscow to host the event .
suggestions the tennis contest could be held at wimbledon may not now make it past the drawing board .
barbara cassani , who is chairing the london bid , admits the all-england tennis club may not form part of the plans because grass would not be considered appropriate for disabled athletes , who will be competing in the paralympics .

the report , from the welsh assembly 's social services inspectorate , speaks of " inexplicable delays " in dealing with child protection cases .
sixteen cases , almost half of those sampled , caused such concern that they have been referred for immediate review .
the inspectors were sent back to cardiff after its social services department - the largest in wales - received one of the worst reviews in england and wales fourteen months ago .
at the time the running of the department was criticised as being " macho " and damaging to staff morale , and as a result the report said that children were in danger .
vulnerable i am concerned that those who depend upon these services are not yet guaranteed a reliable and consistent response jane hutt the new report states that although cardiff council has made considerable efforts to improve , services to support and protect vulnerable children are still not consistent .
it said : " too many children were not receiving the standards of service they needed to safeguard and promote their welfare . "
jane hutt , the health and social services minister , said the new report highlights the " gravity of problems in children 's services in cardiff , and how much remains to be done . "
she said : " i am concerned that those who depend upon these services - especially vulnerable children - are not yet guaranteed a reliable and consistent response . "
cardiff council 's social services department has been criticised mrs hutt said that under the protocol for dealing with serious concern , the chief social services inspector , graham williams , would now write to cardiff county council setting out the improvements needed and how this will be monitored .
she added : " at this stage i have seriously considered using my powers under section 7a of the local authority social services act 1970 to impose directions upon the council in response to the outcome of this report . "
the conservative health and social services spokesman jonathan morgan said it was a " disgraceful position for cardiff council to find themselves in . "

" there is now a strong argument for the assembly to intervene and remove cardiff from the running of children 's services in the capital city . "
and mr morgan called for ms hutt 's resignation .
he said , " the minister is directly responsible for the appalling state of social services in cardiff .
" she did nothing a year ago when we received the first report naming cardiff social services as the second worst in the uk .
she is doing nothing about it now .
" we have learnt from victoria climbie that inaction is the worst course of action .
" quite simply she is not up to the job and must go . "
' significant improvements ' the inspectors were sent back to cardiff after the worst social services review so far seen in wales .
the audit report released in september 2002 found the cases of children at risk of abuse were being mishandled due to a " bullying " , " macho " , " arrogant " and " secretive " management culture at the local authority .
but cardiff council 's director of social services , chris davies , said some improvements had been made .
asked if things were as bad as a year previously , he said : " no they are not . "
he added : " even in april when the inspection was done , the inspectors noted significant improvements in vital areas .

the report , from the welsh assembly 's social services inspectorate , speaks of " inexplicable delays " in dealing with child protection cases .
sixteen cases , almost half of those sampled , caused such concern that they have been referred for immediate review .
the inspectors were sent back to cardiff after its social services department - the largest in wales - received one of the worst reviews in england and wales fourteen months ago .
at the time the running of the department was criticised as being " macho " and damaging to staff morale , and as a result the report said that children were in danger .
vulnerable i am concerned that those who depend upon these services are not yet guaranteed a reliable and consistent response jane hutt the new report states that although cardiff council has made considerable efforts to improve , services to support and protect vulnerable children are still not consistent .
it said : " too many children were not receiving the standards of service they needed to safeguard and promote their welfare . "
jane hutt , the health and social services minister , said the new report highlights the " gravity of problems in children 's services in cardiff , and how much remains to be done . "
she said : " i am concerned that those who depend upon these services - especially vulnerable children - are not yet guaranteed a reliable and consistent response . "
cardiff council 's social services department has been criticised mrs hutt said that under the protocol for dealing with serious concern , the chief social services inspector , graham williams , would now write to cardiff county council setting out the improvements needed and how this will be monitored .
she added : " at this stage i have seriously considered using my powers under section 7a of the local authority social services act 1970 to impose directions upon the council in response to the outcome of this report . "
the conservative health and social services spokesman jonathan morgan said it was a " disgraceful position for cardiff council to find themselves in . "

" there is now a strong argument for the assembly to intervene and remove cardiff from the running of children 's services in the capital city . "
and mr morgan called for ms hutt 's resignation .
he said , " the minister is directly responsible for the appalling state of social services in cardiff .
" she did nothing a year ago when we received the first report naming cardiff social services as the second worst in the uk .

' significant improvements ' the inspectors were sent back to cardiff after the worst social services review so far seen in wales .
the audit report released in september 2002 found the cases of children at risk of abuse were being mishandled due to a " bullying " , " macho " , " arrogant " and " secretive " management culture at the local authority .
but cardiff council 's director of social services , chris davies , said some improvements had been made .
asked if things were as bad as a year previously , he said : " no they are not . "

ronnie milsop from the dogs ' trust was speaking after a man pleaded guilty on tuesday to causing 49 pups and three kittens unnecessary suffering by denying them adequate space , ventilation and water .
he was fined £ 500 after he was caught trafficking puppies .
john walsh was also the man who imported the sheep which led to the first case of foot-and-mouth in northern ireland two years ago .
he had been jailed for three months in 2001 for illegally bringing sheep to ireland .
walsh brought a consignment of sheep into northern ireland from carlisle in cumbria in february that year at the beginning of the foot-and-mouth outbreak .
they were supposed to go for slaughter at an abattoir but the deal fell through and they ended up instead on a farm in south armagh .
the animals were discovered to have the disease at the end of that month .
the authorities in northern ireland said at the time the animals in question had been illegally imported into the province .
but walsh , who fled to england following the furore over the outbreak , protested his innocence , saying he did not intentionally buy diseased sheep .
on tuesday , stranraer sheriff court heard that , walsh , whose address was given as brampton in cumbria , had 49 pups and three kittens in the back of his car when he was stopped by police at cairnryan in july 2003 .
many of them were found to be covered in their own urine and faeces , while others had lice .
nine of the pups were in such a poor condition that they had to be given emergency treatment by vets .
the court was shown a video of the animals taken by inspectors for the scottish society for the prevention of cruelty to animals .
fining walsh , sheriff brian adair said he accepted that it had been an error of judgement .
walsh was also ordered to pay compensation of nearly £ 2,900 in cost to the sspca which took the animals into care .
speaking after the case , mr milsop said : " to stop this , we have to hurt the people who are doing it .
" the only way to do that is heavy fines . £ 500 is insignificant in this atrocious case of 49 dogs packed into what looks to be just a small vehicle . "
doreen graham , a spokeswoman for the sspca , said the fine was disappointing .
" the £ 500 is the resale price of just two puppies .
the potential for misery for these animals was unbelievably high .
" given the high temperatures we experienced during the summer , it is a miracle that none of these animals died .
" we are seeing a large number of puppies coming into scotland from puppy farms in southern ireland and it is big business , " she said .

ronnie milsop from the dogs ' trust was speaking after a man pleaded guilty on tuesday to causing 49 pups and three kittens unnecessary suffering by denying them adequate space , ventilation and water .
he was fined £ 500 after he was caught trafficking puppies .
john walsh was also the man who imported the sheep which led to the first case of foot-and-mouth in northern ireland two years ago .
he had been jailed for three months in 2001 for illegally bringing sheep to ireland .
walsh brought a consignment of sheep into northern ireland from carlisle in cumbria in february that year at the beginning of the foot-and-mouth outbreak .
they were supposed to go for slaughter at an abattoir but the deal fell through and they ended up instead on a farm in south armagh .
the animals were discovered to have the disease at the end of that month .
the authorities in northern ireland said at the time the animals in question had been illegally imported into the province .
but walsh , who fled to england following the furore over the outbreak , protested his innocence , saying he did not intentionally buy diseased sheep .
on tuesday , stranraer sheriff court heard that , walsh , whose address was given as brampton in cumbria , had 49 pups and three kittens in the back of his car when he was stopped by police at cairnryan in july 2003 .
many of them were found to be covered in their own urine and faeces , while others had lice .
several of the animals required veterinary treatment nine of the pups were in such a poor condition that they had to be given emergency treatment by vets .
the court was shown a video of the animals taken by inspectors for the scottish society for the prevention of cruelty to animals .
fining walsh , sheriff brian adair said he accepted that it had been an error of judgement .
walsh was also ordered to pay compensation of nearly £ 2,900 in cost to the sspca which took the animals into care .
speaking after the case , mr milsop said : " to stop this , we have to hurt the people who are doing it .
" the only way to do that is heavy fines . £ 500 is insignificant in this atrocious case of 49 dogs packed into what looks to be just a small vehicle . "
doreen graham , a spokeswoman for the sspca , said the fine was disappointing .
" the £ 500 is the resale price of just two puppies .
the potential for misery for these animals was unbelievably high .
" given the high temperatures we experienced during the summer , it is a miracle that none of these animals died .
" we are seeing a large number of puppies coming into scotland from puppy farms in southern ireland and it is big business , " she said .
