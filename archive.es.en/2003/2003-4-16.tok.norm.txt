germany ’ s six leading economic institutes on tuesday dramatically cut their growth forecast for 2003 and urged the government to press ahead with painful social security and labor market reforms . in their spring report , the economic institutes said they only expected the german economy to grow 0.5 percent this year .
only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .
for 2004 , they cut their growth forecast from 2.25 percent to only 1.8 percent . the institutes said europe ’ s largest economy was likely to be blighted with sluggish growth and increasing unemployment for the foreseeable future , unless the german government continued with painful reforms to cut back the welfare state and liberalize the labor market . schröder ’ s reform package german chancellor gerhard schröder last month announced a package of sweeping proposals to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . though the six think-tanks endorsed the direction of the government ’ s reform proposals , the spring report also made clear that the institutes didn ’ t believe they went far enough to re-ignite the economy : “ if this agenda contains everything that is supposed to be implemented by 2010 , then conditions for growth will not improve considerably . ” in recent years , the german economy has stalled under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . increased pressure on the government the slashed 2003 growth forecast will likely increase pressure on the government to lower its own official forecast of one percent growth for this year .
that in turn could spell trouble for berlin and its budget deficit , which the institutes expect to reach 3.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 .
that would mean germany would break the european union ’ s three-percent limit for a second consecutive year . the institutes expect unemployment to average 4.45 million this year , compared with the government 's official forecast of 4.14 million .
unemployment is seen rising even further in 2004 to average 4.5 million , which would be an all-time record .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .
holding onto and extending power takes priority over problem solving , ” bert rürup recently told the german weekly stern . that 's why - instead of proposing revolutionary change all at once - rürup says he prefers incremental steps , hoping each will take hold and pave the way for further reforms : “ i would rather put through powerful reforms in small steps than propose a ‘ brilliant concept ’ likely to end up in the history -lrb- but not the law -rrb- books . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .
topping the agenda is the role the eu should play in the reconstruction of iraq and deployment of humanitarian aid .
the majority of european countries are pleading for a leading role for the united nations - a demand the united states has viewed with considerable scepticism .
washington 's key european allies in the iraq war - britain , spain and denmark - have also questioned the extent to which the un should be engaged in the postwar persian gulf region . " the fulfilment of a dream " but bureaucrats in brussels like verheugen are optimistic that tensions over iraq wo n't distract from the historical magnitude of the athens summit .
there have been four previous expansions of the european union from the original six member states , but this will by far be the largest , with 10 new members . for the moment , at least , as the heads of state gather beneath the acropolis , the historical importance of european expansion will likely paper over the deep chasm in thinking between eu member states .
in addition to the heads of states from the existing 15 eu member states and 10 future members , united nations secretary general kofi annan will also attend the ceremony as well as the leaders of turkey , bulgaria , romania , croatia and serbia . " i have to say , this is really the fulfilment of a dream , " verheugen said .
" when i first got started in brussels , i did n't think this would be possible , but we 've succeeded .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .
topping the agenda is the role the eu should play in the reconstruction of iraq and deployment of humanitarian aid .
the majority of european countries are pleading for a leading role for the united nations - a demand the united states has viewed with considerable scepticism .
washington 's key european allies in the iraq war - britain , spain and denmark - have also questioned the extent to which the un should be engaged in the postwar persian gulf region . " the fulfilment of a dream " but bureaucrats in brussels like verheugen are optimistic that tensions over iraq wo n't distract from the historical magnitude of the athens summit .
there have been four previous expansions of the european union from the original six member states , but this will by far be the largest , with 10 new members . for the moment , at least , as the heads of state gather beneath the acropolis , the historical importance of european expansion will likely paper over the deep chasm in thinking between eu member states .
in addition to the heads of states from the existing 15 eu member states and 10 future members , united nations secretary general kofi annan will also attend the ceremony as well as the leaders of turkey , bulgaria , romania , croatia and serbia . " i have to say , this is really the fulfilment of a dream , " verheugen said .
" when i first got started in brussels , i did n't think this would be possible , but we 've succeeded .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .
holding onto and extending power takes priority over problem solving , ” bert rürup recently told the german weekly stern . that 's why - instead of proposing revolutionary change all at once - rürup says he prefers incremental steps , hoping each will take hold and pave the way for further reforms : “ i would rather put through powerful reforms in small steps than propose a ‘ brilliant concept ’ likely to end up in the history -lrb- but not the law -rrb- books . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

germany ’ s six leading economic institutes on tuesday dramatically cut their growth forecast for 2003 and urged the government to press ahead with painful social security and labor market reforms . in their spring report , the economic institutes said they only expected the german economy to grow 0.5 percent this year .
only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .
for 2004 , they cut their growth forecast from 2.25 percent to only 1.8 percent . the institutes said europe ’ s largest economy was likely to be blighted with sluggish growth and increasing unemployment for the foreseeable future , unless the german government continued with painful reforms to cut back the welfare state and liberalize the labor market . schröder ’ s reform package german chancellor gerhard schröder last month announced a package of sweeping proposals to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . though the six think-tanks endorsed the direction of the government ’ s reform proposals , the spring report also made clear that the institutes didn ’ t believe they went far enough to re-ignite the economy : “ if this agenda contains everything that is supposed to be implemented by 2010 , then conditions for growth will not improve considerably . ” in recent years , the german economy has stalled under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . increased pressure on the government the slashed 2003 growth forecast will likely increase pressure on the government to lower its own official forecast of one percent growth for this year .
that in turn could spell trouble for berlin and its budget deficit , which the institutes expect to reach 3.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 .
that would mean germany would break the european union ’ s three-percent limit for a second consecutive year . the institutes expect unemployment to average 4.45 million this year , compared with the government 's official forecast of 4.14 million .
unemployment is seen rising even further in 2004 to average 4.5 million , which would be an all-time record .

only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .
for 2004 , they cut their growth forecast from 2.25 percent to only 1.8 percent . the institutes said europe ’ s largest economy was likely to be blighted with sluggish growth and increasing unemployment for the foreseeable future , unless the german government continued with painful reforms to cut back the welfare state and liberalize the labor market . schröder ’ s reform package german chancellor gerhard schröder last month announced a package of sweeping proposals to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . though the six think-tanks endorsed the direction of the government ’ s reform proposals , the spring report also made clear that the institutes didn ’ t believe they went far enough to re-ignite the economy : “ if this agenda contains everything that is supposed to be implemented by 2010 , then conditions for growth will not improve considerably . ” in recent years , the german economy has stalled under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . increased pressure on the government the slashed 2003 growth forecast will likely increase pressure on the government to lower its own official forecast of one percent growth for this year .
that in turn could spell trouble for berlin and its budget deficit , which the institutes expect to reach 3.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 .
that would mean germany would break the european union ’ s three-percent limit for a second consecutive year . the institutes expect unemployment to average 4.45 million this year , compared with the government 's official forecast of 4.14 million .
unemployment is seen rising even further in 2004 to average 4.5 million , which would be an all-time record .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economy minister wolfgang clement but german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement dismissed the bleak outlook for the country ’ s joblessness , saying the government was on the right course . “ the institutes underestimate how dynamic our labor market reforms are , ” he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .
topping the agenda is the role the eu should play in the reconstruction of iraq and deployment of humanitarian aid .
the majority of european countries are pleading for a leading role for the united nations - a demand the united states has viewed with considerable scepticism .
washington 's key european allies in the iraq war - britain , spain and denmark - have also questioned the extent to which the un should be engaged in the postwar persian gulf region . " the fulfilment of a dream " but bureaucrats in brussels like verheugen are optimistic that tensions over iraq wo n't distract from the historical magnitude of the athens summit .
there have been four previous expansions of the european union from the original six member states , but this will by far be the largest , with 10 new members . for the moment , at least , as the heads of state gather beneath the acropolis , the historical importance of european expansion will likely paper over the deep chasm in thinking between eu member states .
in addition to the heads of states from the existing 15 eu member states and 10 future members , united nations secretary general kofi annan will also attend the ceremony as well as the leaders of turkey , bulgaria , romania , croatia and serbia .

germany ’ s six leading economic institutes on tuesday dramatically cut their growth forecast for 2003 and urged the government to press ahead with painful social security and labor market reforms . in their spring report , the economic institutes said they only expected the german economy to grow 0.5 percent this year .
only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .
for 2004 , they cut their growth forecast from 2.25 percent to only 1.8 percent . the institutes said europe ’ s largest economy was likely to be blighted with sluggish growth and increasing unemployment for the foreseeable future , unless the german government continued with painful reforms to cut back the welfare state and liberalize the labor market . schröder ’ s reform package german chancellor gerhard schröder last month announced a package of sweeping proposals to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . though the six think-tanks endorsed the direction of the government ’ s reform proposals , the spring report also made clear that the institutes didn ’ t believe they went far enough to re-ignite the economy : “ if this agenda contains everything that is supposed to be implemented by 2010 , then conditions for growth will not improve considerably . ” in recent years , the german economy has stalled under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . increased pressure on the government the slashed 2003 growth forecast will likely increase pressure on the government to lower its own official forecast of one percent growth for this year .
that in turn could spell trouble for berlin and its budget deficit , which the institutes expect to reach 3.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 .
that would mean germany would break the european union ’ s three-percent limit for a second consecutive year . the institutes expect unemployment to average 4.45 million this year , compared with the government 's official forecast of 4.14 million .
unemployment is seen rising even further in 2004 to average 4.5 million , which would be an all-time record .

in a speech before the european parliament , european commission president romano prodi rejected calls for the creation of a powerful eu president by countries like great britain and france .
prodi said the power should reside with the policy-initiating commission and the 626-member european parliament .
he proposed establishing a foreign minister for the eu who would become the body 's " single voice " on international issues .
" it is no longer just a question of ensuring the institutions work properly after enlargement , " prodi said .
" it must work out the overall shape of the union for generations to come . "
" prodi 's bible " the commission president submitted his draft to parliament in a 17-page , bound red pocket book , which has been dubbed " prodi 's bible . "
among the primary commandments listed is prodi 's call for the abolition of the right to veto held by member states .
describing unanimity as one of the " bleakest periods " of eu history , prodi said he would only support the requirement in cases of " constitutional importance " and instead insisted on the acceptance of qualified majorities in most eu decisions .
the right of member nations to veto legislation and regulations has made it difficult for the commission to assert authority in crucial areas ranging from contentious agricultural policies to defense . the shift would likely provide the eu with more authority on home and judicial affairs that could extend into taxation and defense .
simple majorities are the best way of avoiding legislative gridlock after the eu grows from 15 to 25 member states in 2004 , he argued .
no need for an eu president saying it would " cause more problems than it would solve , " prodi also rejected calls for a democratically elected european president and instead suggested that the commission president should be elected by a two-thirds majority in parliament , thus providing democratic legitimacy for the position .
an elected president " may enhance continuity and visibility of the union 's work , " said prodi .
" but it divests the member states - and it deprives us all - of an opportunity for close involvement in the european project .
quite frankly , such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing france , britain , spain and eu convention president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- have all called for the creation of a president of the european council - a single visage for the continent .
names from british prime minister tony blair to spanish prime minister jose maria aznar have been bandied about for the top slot .
but prodi said thursday he is in favor of maintaining the current six-month rotating eu presidency .
a single face for foreign policy but there is one area where prodi clearly sees the need for a single voice : foreign policy .
he is calling for the creation of a single , powerful eu foreign minister who would be given more power and merge the global duties currently shared by javier solana , the eu 's high foreign policy representative , and chris patten , it 's external relations commissioner .
the position would be appointed by the commission president and eu member states and would be considered the commission 's vice president .
" national leaders should act on their commitment to make europe a superpower , " he told the parliament .
" speaking with one voice is essential to defend europe 's social model in a globalized world and protect our values . "
support may be limited prodi 's vision for a european constitutional framework with a strong federalist backbone is likely to create conflict with britain , france and spain , which favor greater sovereignty for member states .
but it is likely to be supported by germany and many of the smaller eu states , which prefer strengthening the triumvirate of power in brussels .
" he 's delivered an integrationist agenda with useful ideas , but one where member states are worried about the commission 's ability to take over those responsibilities , " heather grabbe , research director at the london-based center for european reform , told dw-world : " the commission 's proposal is acceptable to some of the member states , especially the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , but many others including france and britain are opposed to having more power for the commission - especially in areas of defense , foreign policy and taxation . "
grabbe believes opponents to prodi 's vision want to maintain veto powers in those policy areas . the commission released its plan just one month after giscard d 'estaing , who is heading the european constitutional convention , unveiled his own blueprint for a future european constitution .
among d 'estaing 's central proposals was the creation of a powerful eu president .

in a speech before the european parliament , european commission president romano prodi rejected calls for the creation of a powerful eu president by countries like great britain and france .
prodi said the power should reside with the policy-initiating commission and the 626-member european parliament .
he proposed establishing a foreign minister for the eu who would become the body 's " single voice " on international issues .
" it is no longer just a question of ensuring the institutions work properly after enlargement , " prodi said .
" it must work out the overall shape of the union for generations to come . "
" prodi 's bible " the commission president submitted his draft to parliament in a 17-page , bound red pocket book , which has been dubbed " prodi 's bible . "
among the primary commandments listed is prodi 's call for the abolition of the right to veto held by member states .
describing unanimity as one of the " bleakest periods " of eu history , prodi said he would only support the requirement in cases of " constitutional importance " and instead insisted on the acceptance of qualified majorities in most eu decisions .
the right of member nations to veto legislation and regulations has made it difficult for the commission to assert authority in crucial areas ranging from contentious agricultural policies to defense . the shift would likely provide the eu with more authority on home and judicial affairs that could extend into taxation and defense .
simple majorities are the best way of avoiding legislative gridlock after the eu grows from 15 to 25 member states in 2004 , he argued .
no need for an eu president saying it would " cause more problems than it would solve , " prodi also rejected calls for a democratically elected european president and instead suggested that the commission president should be elected by a two-thirds majority in parliament , thus providing democratic legitimacy for the position .
an elected president " may enhance continuity and visibility of the union 's work , " said prodi .
" but it divests the member states - and it deprives us all - of an opportunity for close involvement in the european project .
quite frankly , such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing france , britain , spain and eu convention president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- have all called for the creation of a president of the european council - a single visage for the continent .
names from british prime minister tony blair to spanish prime minister jose maria aznar have been bandied about for the top slot .
but prodi said thursday he is in favor of maintaining the current six-month rotating eu presidency .
a single face for foreign policy but there is one area where prodi clearly sees the need for a single voice : foreign policy .
he is calling for the creation of a single , powerful eu foreign minister who would be given more power and merge the global duties currently shared by javier solana , the eu 's high foreign policy representative , and chris patten , it 's external relations commissioner .
the position would be appointed by the commission president and eu member states and would be considered the commission 's vice president .
" national leaders should act on their commitment to make europe a superpower , " he told the parliament .
" speaking with one voice is essential to defend europe 's social model in a globalized world and protect our values . "
support may be limited prodi 's vision for a european constitutional framework with a strong federalist backbone is likely to create conflict with britain , france and spain , which favor greater sovereignty for member states .
but it is likely to be supported by germany and many of the smaller eu states , which prefer strengthening the triumvirate of power in brussels .
" he 's delivered an integrationist agenda with useful ideas , but one where member states are worried about the commission 's ability to take over those responsibilities , " heather grabbe , research director at the london-based center for european reform , told dw-world : " the commission 's proposal is acceptable to some of the member states , especially the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , but many others including france and britain are opposed to having more power for the commission - especially in areas of defense , foreign policy and taxation . "
grabbe believes opponents to prodi 's vision want to maintain veto powers in those policy areas . the commission released its plan just one month after giscard d 'estaing , who is heading the european constitutional convention , unveiled his own blueprint for a future european constitution .

he proposed establishing a foreign minister for the eu who would become the body 's " single voice " on international issues .
" it is no longer just a question of ensuring the institutions work properly after enlargement , " prodi said .
" it must work out the overall shape of the union for generations to come . "
" prodi 's bible " the commission president submitted his draft to parliament in a 17-page , bound red pocket book , which has been dubbed " prodi 's bible . "
among the primary commandments listed is prodi 's call for the abolition of the right to veto held by member states .
describing unanimity as one of the " bleakest periods " of eu history , prodi said he would only support the requirement in cases of " constitutional importance " and instead insisted on the acceptance of qualified majorities in most eu decisions .
the right of member nations to veto legislation and regulations has made it difficult for the commission to assert authority in crucial areas ranging from contentious agricultural policies to defense . the shift would likely provide the eu with more authority on home and judicial affairs that could extend into taxation and defense .
simple majorities are the best way of avoiding legislative gridlock after the eu grows from 15 to 25 member states in 2004 , he argued .
no need for an eu president saying it would " cause more problems than it would solve , " prodi also rejected calls for a democratically elected european president and instead suggested that the commission president should be elected by a two-thirds majority in parliament , thus providing democratic legitimacy for the position .
an elected president " may enhance continuity and visibility of the union 's work , " said prodi .
" but it divests the member states - and it deprives us all - of an opportunity for close involvement in the european project .
quite frankly , such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing france , britain , spain and eu convention president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- have all called for the creation of a president of the european council - a single visage for the continent .
names from british prime minister tony blair to spanish prime minister jose maria aznar have been bandied about for the top slot .
but prodi said thursday he is in favor of maintaining the current six-month rotating eu presidency .
a single face for foreign policy but there is one area where prodi clearly sees the need for a single voice : foreign policy .
he is calling for the creation of a single , powerful eu foreign minister who would be given more power and merge the global duties currently shared by javier solana , the eu 's high foreign policy representative , and chris patten , it 's external relations commissioner .
the position would be appointed by the commission president and eu member states and would be considered the commission 's vice president .
" national leaders should act on their commitment to make europe a superpower , " he told the parliament .
" speaking with one voice is essential to defend europe 's social model in a globalized world and protect our values . "
support may be limited prodi 's vision for a european constitutional framework with a strong federalist backbone is likely to create conflict with britain , france and spain , which favor greater sovereignty for member states .
but it is likely to be supported by germany and many of the smaller eu states , which prefer strengthening the triumvirate of power in brussels .
" he 's delivered an integrationist agenda with useful ideas , but one where member states are worried about the commission 's ability to take over those responsibilities , " heather grabbe , research director at the london-based center for european reform , told dw-world : " the commission 's proposal is acceptable to some of the member states , especially the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , but many others including france and britain are opposed to having more power for the commission - especially in areas of defense , foreign policy and taxation . "
grabbe believes opponents to prodi 's vision want to maintain veto powers in those policy areas . the commission released its plan just one month after giscard d 'estaing , who is heading the european constitutional convention , unveiled his own blueprint for a future european constitution .
among d 'estaing 's central proposals was the creation of a powerful eu president .

quite frankly , such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing france , britain , spain and eu convention president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- have all called for the creation of a president of the european council - a single visage for the continent .
names from british prime minister tony blair to spanish prime minister jose maria aznar have been bandied about for the top slot .
but prodi said thursday he is in favor of maintaining the current six-month rotating eu presidency .
a single face for foreign policy but there is one area where prodi clearly sees the need for a single voice : foreign policy .
he is calling for the creation of a single , powerful eu foreign minister who would be given more power and merge the global duties currently shared by javier solana , the eu 's high foreign policy representative , and chris patten , it 's external relations commissioner .
the position would be appointed by the commission president and eu member states and would be considered the commission 's vice president .
" national leaders should act on their commitment to make europe a superpower , " he told the parliament .
" speaking with one voice is essential to defend europe 's social model in a globalized world and protect our values . "
support may be limited prodi 's vision for a european constitutional framework with a strong federalist backbone is likely to create conflict with britain , france and spain , which favor greater sovereignty for member states .
but it is likely to be supported by germany and many of the smaller eu states , which prefer strengthening the triumvirate of power in brussels .
" he 's delivered an integrationist agenda with useful ideas , but one where member states are worried about the commission 's ability to take over those responsibilities , " heather grabbe , research director at the london-based center for european reform , told dw-world : " the commission 's proposal is acceptable to some of the member states , especially the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , but many others including france and britain are opposed to having more power for the commission - especially in areas of defense , foreign policy and taxation . "
grabbe believes opponents to prodi 's vision want to maintain veto powers in those policy areas . the commission released its plan just one month after giscard d 'estaing , who is heading the european constitutional convention , unveiled his own blueprint for a future european constitution .
among d 'estaing 's central proposals was the creation of a powerful eu president .
giscard d 'estaing and the delegation he is leading are expected to prepare a draft european constitution by next summer . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reactions mixed to draft eu constitution former french president valery giscard d 'estaing unveiled the first draft of a new european constitution on monday that could lead to a " united europe " with an elected president and increased federalism .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .

" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .

" and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 16.04.2003 reforming the social welfare state großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tomorrow 's pensioners may not have it so easy .
recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .

so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .

they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .
topping the agenda is the role the eu should play in the reconstruction of iraq and deployment of humanitarian aid .
the majority of european countries are pleading for a leading role for the united nations - a demand the united states has viewed with considerable scepticism .
washington 's key european allies in the iraq war - britain , spain and denmark - have also questioned the extent to which the un should be engaged in the postwar persian gulf region . " the fulfilment of a dream " but bureaucrats in brussels like verheugen are optimistic that tensions over iraq wo n't distract from the historical magnitude of the athens summit .
there have been four previous expansions of the european union from the original six member states , but this will by far be the largest , with 10 new members . for the moment , at least , as the heads of state gather beneath the acropolis , the historical importance of european expansion will likely paper over the deep chasm in thinking between eu member states .
in addition to the heads of states from the existing 15 eu member states and 10 future members , united nations secretary general kofi annan will also attend the ceremony as well as the leaders of turkey , bulgaria , romania , croatia and serbia . " i have to say , this is really the fulfilment of a dream , " verheugen said .
" when i first got started in brussels , i did n't think this would be possible , but we 've succeeded .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .
holding onto and extending power takes priority over problem solving , ” bert rürup recently told the german weekly stern . that 's why - instead of proposing revolutionary change all at once - rürup says he prefers incremental steps , hoping each will take hold and pave the way for further reforms : “ i would rather put through powerful reforms in small steps than propose a ‘ brilliant concept ’ likely to end up in the history -lrb- but not the law -rrb- books . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.04.2003 iraq threatens to overshadow eu expansion summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want to make history for the second time at athens ' acropolis .
eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .

germany ’ s six leading economic institutes on tuesday dramatically cut their growth forecast for 2003 and urged the government to press ahead with painful social security and labor market reforms . in their spring report , the economic institutes said they only expected the german economy to grow 0.5 percent this year .
only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .
for 2004 , they cut their growth forecast from 2.25 percent to only 1.8 percent . the institutes said europe ’ s largest economy was likely to be blighted with sluggish growth and increasing unemployment for the foreseeable future , unless the german government continued with painful reforms to cut back the welfare state and liberalize the labor market . schröder ’ s reform package german chancellor gerhard schröder last month announced a package of sweeping proposals to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . though the six think-tanks endorsed the direction of the government ’ s reform proposals , the spring report also made clear that the institutes didn ’ t believe they went far enough to re-ignite the economy : “ if this agenda contains everything that is supposed to be implemented by 2010 , then conditions for growth will not improve considerably . ” in recent years , the german economy has stalled under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . increased pressure on the government the slashed 2003 growth forecast will likely increase pressure on the government to lower its own official forecast of one percent growth for this year .
that in turn could spell trouble for berlin and its budget deficit , which the institutes expect to reach 3.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 .
that would mean germany would break the european union ’ s three-percent limit for a second consecutive year . the institutes expect unemployment to average 4.45 million this year , compared with the government 's official forecast of 4.14 million .
unemployment is seen rising even further in 2004 to average 4.5 million , which would be an all-time record .

germany ’ s six leading economic institutes on tuesday dramatically cut their growth forecast for 2003 and urged the government to press ahead with painful social security and labor market reforms . in their spring report , the economic institutes said they only expected the german economy to grow 0.5 percent this year .
only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .
for 2004 , they cut their growth forecast from 2.25 percent to only 1.8 percent . the institutes said europe ’ s largest economy was likely to be blighted with sluggish growth and increasing unemployment for the foreseeable future , unless the german government continued with painful reforms to cut back the welfare state and liberalize the labor market . schröder ’ s reform package german chancellor gerhard schröder last month announced a package of sweeping proposals to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . though the six think-tanks endorsed the direction of the government ’ s reform proposals , the spring report also made clear that the institutes didn ’ t believe they went far enough to re-ignite the economy : “ if this agenda contains everything that is supposed to be implemented by 2010 , then conditions for growth will not improve considerably . ” in recent years , the german economy has stalled under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . increased pressure on the government the slashed 2003 growth forecast will likely increase pressure on the government to lower its own official forecast of one percent growth for this year .
that in turn could spell trouble for berlin and its budget deficit , which the institutes expect to reach 3.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 .
that would mean germany would break the european union ’ s three-percent limit for a second consecutive year . the institutes expect unemployment to average 4.45 million this year , compared with the government 's official forecast of 4.14 million .
unemployment is seen rising even further in 2004 to average 4.5 million , which would be an all-time record .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economy minister wolfgang clement but german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement dismissed the bleak outlook for the country ’ s joblessness , saying the government was on the right course . “ the institutes underestimate how dynamic our labor market reforms are , ” he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

in a speech before the european parliament , european commission president romano prodi rejected calls for the creation of a powerful eu president by countries like great britain and france .
prodi said the power should reside with the policy-initiating commission and the 626-member european parliament .
he proposed establishing a foreign minister for the eu who would become the body 's " single voice " on international issues .
" it is no longer just a question of ensuring the institutions work properly after enlargement , " prodi said .
" it must work out the overall shape of the union for generations to come . "
" prodi 's bible " the commission president submitted his draft to parliament in a 17-page , bound red pocket book , which has been dubbed " prodi 's bible . "
among the primary commandments listed is prodi 's call for the abolition of the right to veto held by member states .
describing unanimity as one of the " bleakest periods " of eu history , prodi said he would only support the requirement in cases of " constitutional importance " and instead insisted on the acceptance of qualified majorities in most eu decisions .
the right of member nations to veto legislation and regulations has made it difficult for the commission to assert authority in crucial areas ranging from contentious agricultural policies to defense . the shift would likely provide the eu with more authority on home and judicial affairs that could extend into taxation and defense .
simple majorities are the best way of avoiding legislative gridlock after the eu grows from 15 to 25 member states in 2004 , he argued .
no need for an eu president saying it would " cause more problems than it would solve , " prodi also rejected calls for a democratically elected european president and instead suggested that the commission president should be elected by a two-thirds majority in parliament , thus providing democratic legitimacy for the position .
an elected president " may enhance continuity and visibility of the union 's work , " said prodi .
" but it divests the member states - and it deprives us all - of an opportunity for close involvement in the european project .
quite frankly , such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing france , britain , spain and eu convention president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- have all called for the creation of a president of the european council - a single visage for the continent .
names from british prime minister tony blair to spanish prime minister jose maria aznar have been bandied about for the top slot .
but prodi said thursday he is in favor of maintaining the current six-month rotating eu presidency .
a single face for foreign policy but there is one area where prodi clearly sees the need for a single voice : foreign policy .
he is calling for the creation of a single , powerful eu foreign minister who would be given more power and merge the global duties currently shared by javier solana , the eu 's high foreign policy representative , and chris patten , it 's external relations commissioner .
the position would be appointed by the commission president and eu member states and would be considered the commission 's vice president .
" national leaders should act on their commitment to make europe a superpower , " he told the parliament .
" speaking with one voice is essential to defend europe 's social model in a globalized world and protect our values . "
support may be limited prodi 's vision for a european constitutional framework with a strong federalist backbone is likely to create conflict with britain , france and spain , which favor greater sovereignty for member states .
but it is likely to be supported by germany and many of the smaller eu states , which prefer strengthening the triumvirate of power in brussels .
" he 's delivered an integrationist agenda with useful ideas , but one where member states are worried about the commission 's ability to take over those responsibilities , " heather grabbe , research director at the london-based center for european reform , told dw-world : " the commission 's proposal is acceptable to some of the member states , especially the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , but many others including france and britain are opposed to having more power for the commission - especially in areas of defense , foreign policy and taxation . "
grabbe believes opponents to prodi 's vision want to maintain veto powers in those policy areas . the commission released its plan just one month after giscard d 'estaing , who is heading the european constitutional convention , unveiled his own blueprint for a future european constitution .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .
topping the agenda is the role the eu should play in the reconstruction of iraq and deployment of humanitarian aid .
the majority of european countries are pleading for a leading role for the united nations - a demand the united states has viewed with considerable scepticism .
washington 's key european allies in the iraq war - britain , spain and denmark - have also questioned the extent to which the un should be engaged in the postwar persian gulf region . " the fulfilment of a dream " but bureaucrats in brussels like verheugen are optimistic that tensions over iraq wo n't distract from the historical magnitude of the athens summit .
there have been four previous expansions of the european union from the original six member states , but this will by far be the largest , with 10 new members . for the moment , at least , as the heads of state gather beneath the acropolis , the historical importance of european expansion will likely paper over the deep chasm in thinking between eu member states .
in addition to the heads of states from the existing 15 eu member states and 10 future members , united nations secretary general kofi annan will also attend the ceremony as well as the leaders of turkey , bulgaria , romania , croatia and serbia . " i have to say , this is really the fulfilment of a dream , " verheugen said .
" when i first got started in brussels , i did n't think this would be possible , but we 've succeeded .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .
holding onto and extending power takes priority over problem solving , ” bert rürup recently told the german weekly stern . that 's why - instead of proposing revolutionary change all at once - rürup says he prefers incremental steps , hoping each will take hold and pave the way for further reforms : “ i would rather put through powerful reforms in small steps than propose a ‘ brilliant concept ’ likely to end up in the history -lrb- but not the law -rrb- books . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .
topping the agenda is the role the eu should play in the reconstruction of iraq and deployment of humanitarian aid .
the majority of european countries are pleading for a leading role for the united nations - a demand the united states has viewed with considerable scepticism .
washington 's key european allies in the iraq war - britain , spain and denmark - have also questioned the extent to which the un should be engaged in the postwar persian gulf region . " the fulfilment of a dream " but bureaucrats in brussels like verheugen are optimistic that tensions over iraq wo n't distract from the historical magnitude of the athens summit .
there have been four previous expansions of the european union from the original six member states , but this will by far be the largest , with 10 new members . for the moment , at least , as the heads of state gather beneath the acropolis , the historical importance of european expansion will likely paper over the deep chasm in thinking between eu member states .
in addition to the heads of states from the existing 15 eu member states and 10 future members , united nations secretary general kofi annan will also attend the ceremony as well as the leaders of turkey , bulgaria , romania , croatia and serbia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.04.2003 german economic institutes slash 2003 growth forecast großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's export-driven economy continues to suffer .
germany ’ s six leading economic institutes on tuesday dramatically cut their growth forecast for 2003 and urged the government to press ahead with painful social security and labor market reforms . in their spring report , the economic institutes said they only expected the german economy to grow 0.5 percent this year .
only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.04.2003 iraq threatens to overshadow eu expansion summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want to make history for the second time at athens ' acropolis .
eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .
topping the agenda is the role the eu should play in the reconstruction of iraq and deployment of humanitarian aid .
the majority of european countries are pleading for a leading role for the united nations - a demand the united states has viewed with considerable scepticism .
washington 's key european allies in the iraq war - britain , spain and denmark - have also questioned the extent to which the un should be engaged in the postwar persian gulf region . " the fulfilment of a dream " but bureaucrats in brussels like verheugen are optimistic that tensions over iraq wo n't distract from the historical magnitude of the athens summit .
there have been four previous expansions of the european union from the original six member states , but this will by far be the largest , with 10 new members . for the moment , at least , as the heads of state gather beneath the acropolis , the historical importance of european expansion will likely paper over the deep chasm in thinking between eu member states .
in addition to the heads of states from the existing 15 eu member states and 10 future members , united nations secretary general kofi annan will also attend the ceremony as well as the leaders of turkey , bulgaria , romania , croatia and serbia . " i have to say , this is really the fulfilment of a dream , " verheugen said .
" when i first got started in brussels , i did n't think this would be possible , but we 've succeeded .

germany ’ s six leading economic institutes on tuesday dramatically cut their growth forecast for 2003 and urged the government to press ahead with painful social security and labor market reforms . in their spring report , the economic institutes said they only expected the german economy to grow 0.5 percent this year .
only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .
for 2004 , they cut their growth forecast from 2.25 percent to only 1.8 percent . the institutes said europe ’ s largest economy was likely to be blighted with sluggish growth and increasing unemployment for the foreseeable future , unless the german government continued with painful reforms to cut back the welfare state and liberalize the labor market . schröder ’ s reform package german chancellor gerhard schröder last month announced a package of sweeping proposals to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . though the six think-tanks endorsed the direction of the government ’ s reform proposals , the spring report also made clear that the institutes didn ’ t believe they went far enough to re-ignite the economy : “ if this agenda contains everything that is supposed to be implemented by 2010 , then conditions for growth will not improve considerably . ” in recent years , the german economy has stalled under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . increased pressure on the government the slashed 2003 growth forecast will likely increase pressure on the government to lower its own official forecast of one percent growth for this year .
that in turn could spell trouble for berlin and its budget deficit , which the institutes expect to reach 3.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 .
that would mean germany would break the european union ’ s three-percent limit for a second consecutive year . the institutes expect unemployment to average 4.45 million this year , compared with the government 's official forecast of 4.14 million .
unemployment is seen rising even further in 2004 to average 4.5 million , which would be an all-time record .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .
topping the agenda is the role the eu should play in the reconstruction of iraq and deployment of humanitarian aid .
the majority of european countries are pleading for a leading role for the united nations - a demand the united states has viewed with considerable scepticism .
washington 's key european allies in the iraq war - britain , spain and denmark - have also questioned the extent to which the un should be engaged in the postwar persian gulf region . " the fulfilment of a dream " but bureaucrats in brussels like verheugen are optimistic that tensions over iraq wo n't distract from the historical magnitude of the athens summit .
there have been four previous expansions of the european union from the original six member states , but this will by far be the largest , with 10 new members . for the moment , at least , as the heads of state gather beneath the acropolis , the historical importance of european expansion will likely paper over the deep chasm in thinking between eu member states .
in addition to the heads of states from the existing 15 eu member states and 10 future members , united nations secretary general kofi annan will also attend the ceremony as well as the leaders of turkey , bulgaria , romania , croatia and serbia . " i have to say , this is really the fulfilment of a dream , " verheugen said .
" when i first got started in brussels , i did n't think this would be possible , but we 've succeeded .

" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .

germany ’ s six leading economic institutes on tuesday dramatically cut their growth forecast for 2003 and urged the government to press ahead with painful social security and labor market reforms . in their spring report , the economic institutes said they only expected the german economy to grow 0.5 percent this year .
only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .
for 2004 , they cut their growth forecast from 2.25 percent to only 1.8 percent . the institutes said europe ’ s largest economy was likely to be blighted with sluggish growth and increasing unemployment for the foreseeable future , unless the german government continued with painful reforms to cut back the welfare state and liberalize the labor market . schröder ’ s reform package german chancellor gerhard schröder last month announced a package of sweeping proposals to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . though the six think-tanks endorsed the direction of the government ’ s reform proposals , the spring report also made clear that the institutes didn ’ t believe they went far enough to re-ignite the economy : “ if this agenda contains everything that is supposed to be implemented by 2010 , then conditions for growth will not improve considerably . ” in recent years , the german economy has stalled under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . increased pressure on the government the slashed 2003 growth forecast will likely increase pressure on the government to lower its own official forecast of one percent growth for this year .
that in turn could spell trouble for berlin and its budget deficit , which the institutes expect to reach 3.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 .
that would mean germany would break the european union ’ s three-percent limit for a second consecutive year . the institutes expect unemployment to average 4.45 million this year , compared with the government 's official forecast of 4.14 million .
unemployment is seen rising even further in 2004 to average 4.5 million , which would be an all-time record .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economy minister wolfgang clement but german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement dismissed the bleak outlook for the country ’ s joblessness , saying the government was on the right course . “ the institutes underestimate how dynamic our labor market reforms are , ” he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .
holding onto and extending power takes priority over problem solving , ” bert rürup recently told the german weekly stern . that 's why - instead of proposing revolutionary change all at once - rürup says he prefers incremental steps , hoping each will take hold and pave the way for further reforms : “ i would rather put through powerful reforms in small steps than propose a ‘ brilliant concept ’ likely to end up in the history -lrb- but not the law -rrb- books . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .
holding onto and extending power takes priority over problem solving , ” bert rürup recently told the german weekly stern . that 's why - instead of proposing revolutionary change all at once - rürup says he prefers incremental steps , hoping each will take hold and pave the way for further reforms : “ i would rather put through powerful reforms in small steps than propose a ‘ brilliant concept ’ likely to end up in the history -lrb- but not the law -rrb- books . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .

germany ’ s six leading economic institutes on tuesday dramatically cut their growth forecast for 2003 and urged the government to press ahead with painful social security and labor market reforms . in their spring report , the economic institutes said they only expected the german economy to grow 0.5 percent this year .
only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .
for 2004 , they cut their growth forecast from 2.25 percent to only 1.8 percent . the institutes said europe ’ s largest economy was likely to be blighted with sluggish growth and increasing unemployment for the foreseeable future , unless the german government continued with painful reforms to cut back the welfare state and liberalize the labor market . schröder ’ s reform package german chancellor gerhard schröder last month announced a package of sweeping proposals to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . though the six think-tanks endorsed the direction of the government ’ s reform proposals , the spring report also made clear that the institutes didn ’ t believe they went far enough to re-ignite the economy : “ if this agenda contains everything that is supposed to be implemented by 2010 , then conditions for growth will not improve considerably . ” in recent years , the german economy has stalled under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . increased pressure on the government the slashed 2003 growth forecast will likely increase pressure on the government to lower its own official forecast of one percent growth for this year .
that in turn could spell trouble for berlin and its budget deficit , which the institutes expect to reach 3.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 .
that would mean germany would break the european union ’ s three-percent limit for a second consecutive year . the institutes expect unemployment to average 4.45 million this year , compared with the government 's official forecast of 4.14 million .
unemployment is seen rising even further in 2004 to average 4.5 million , which would be an all-time record .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economy minister wolfgang clement but german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement dismissed the bleak outlook for the country ’ s joblessness , saying the government was on the right course . “ the institutes underestimate how dynamic our labor market reforms are , ” he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

germany ’ s six leading economic institutes on tuesday dramatically cut their growth forecast for 2003 and urged the government to press ahead with painful social security and labor market reforms . in their spring report , the economic institutes said they only expected the german economy to grow 0.5 percent this year .
only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .
holding onto and extending power takes priority over problem solving , ” bert rürup recently told the german weekly stern . that 's why - instead of proposing revolutionary change all at once - rürup says he prefers incremental steps , hoping each will take hold and pave the way for further reforms : “ i would rather put through powerful reforms in small steps than propose a ‘ brilliant concept ’ likely to end up in the history -lrb- but not the law -rrb- books . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .
holding onto and extending power takes priority over problem solving , ” bert rürup recently told the german weekly stern . that 's why - instead of proposing revolutionary change all at once - rürup says he prefers incremental steps , hoping each will take hold and pave the way for further reforms : “ i would rather put through powerful reforms in small steps than propose a ‘ brilliant concept ’ likely to end up in the history -lrb- but not the law -rrb- books . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .
topping the agenda is the role the eu should play in the reconstruction of iraq and deployment of humanitarian aid .
the majority of european countries are pleading for a leading role for the united nations - a demand the united states has viewed with considerable scepticism .
washington 's key european allies in the iraq war - britain , spain and denmark - have also questioned the extent to which the un should be engaged in the postwar persian gulf region . " the fulfilment of a dream " but bureaucrats in brussels like verheugen are optimistic that tensions over iraq wo n't distract from the historical magnitude of the athens summit .
there have been four previous expansions of the european union from the original six member states , but this will by far be the largest , with 10 new members . for the moment , at least , as the heads of state gather beneath the acropolis , the historical importance of european expansion will likely paper over the deep chasm in thinking between eu member states .
in addition to the heads of states from the existing 15 eu member states and 10 future members , united nations secretary general kofi annan will also attend the ceremony as well as the leaders of turkey , bulgaria , romania , croatia and serbia .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .
holding onto and extending power takes priority over problem solving , ” bert rürup recently told the german weekly stern . that 's why - instead of proposing revolutionary change all at once - rürup says he prefers incremental steps , hoping each will take hold and pave the way for further reforms : “ i would rather put through powerful reforms in small steps than propose a ‘ brilliant concept ’ likely to end up in the history -lrb- but not the law -rrb- books . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .
topping the agenda is the role the eu should play in the reconstruction of iraq and deployment of humanitarian aid .
the majority of european countries are pleading for a leading role for the united nations - a demand the united states has viewed with considerable scepticism .
washington 's key european allies in the iraq war - britain , spain and denmark - have also questioned the extent to which the un should be engaged in the postwar persian gulf region . " the fulfilment of a dream " but bureaucrats in brussels like verheugen are optimistic that tensions over iraq wo n't distract from the historical magnitude of the athens summit .
there have been four previous expansions of the european union from the original six member states , but this will by far be the largest , with 10 new members . for the moment , at least , as the heads of state gather beneath the acropolis , the historical importance of european expansion will likely paper over the deep chasm in thinking between eu member states .
in addition to the heads of states from the existing 15 eu member states and 10 future members , united nations secretary general kofi annan will also attend the ceremony as well as the leaders of turkey , bulgaria , romania , croatia and serbia . " i have to say , this is really the fulfilment of a dream , " verheugen said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : europe 's constitution takes shape eu constitution negotiations draw to a close germany calls for veto power over eu immigration policies germany calls for changes in eu constitution draft eu constitution dominates debate at summit europe -pipe- 16.04.2003 prodi unveils vision of eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commission president romano prodi wants to create a more powerful eu executive calling for the creation of the " first supranational democracy in the world , " eu commission president romano prodi laid out his vision for a federalist constitution of the european union . as europe continues to debate its future shape , one of the european union 's most powerful voices on thursday called for greater centralization of power in brussels .
in a speech before the european parliament , european commission president romano prodi rejected calls for the creation of a powerful eu president by countries like great britain and france .
prodi said the power should reside with the policy-initiating commission and the 626-member european parliament .
he proposed establishing a foreign minister for the eu who would become the body 's " single voice " on international issues .
" it is no longer just a question of ensuring the institutions work properly after enlargement , " prodi said .
" it must work out the overall shape of the union for generations to come . "
" prodi 's bible " the commission president submitted his draft to parliament in a 17-page , bound red pocket book , which has been dubbed " prodi 's bible . "
among the primary commandments listed is prodi 's call for the abolition of the right to veto held by member states .
describing unanimity as one of the " bleakest periods " of eu history , prodi said he would only support the requirement in cases of " constitutional importance " and instead insisted on the acceptance of qualified majorities in most eu decisions .
the right of member nations to veto legislation and regulations has made it difficult for the commission to assert authority in crucial areas ranging from contentious agricultural policies to defense . the shift would likely provide the eu with more authority on home and judicial affairs that could extend into taxation and defense .
simple majorities are the best way of avoiding legislative gridlock after the eu grows from 15 to 25 member states in 2004 , he argued .
no need for an eu president saying it would " cause more problems than it would solve , " prodi also rejected calls for a democratically elected european president and instead suggested that the commission president should be elected by a two-thirds majority in parliament , thus providing democratic legitimacy for the position .
an elected president " may enhance continuity and visibility of the union 's work , " said prodi .
" but it divests the member states - and it deprives us all - of an opportunity for close involvement in the european project .
quite frankly , such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing france , britain , spain and eu convention president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- have all called for the creation of a president of the european council - a single visage for the continent .
names from british prime minister tony blair to spanish prime minister jose maria aznar have been bandied about for the top slot .
but prodi said thursday he is in favor of maintaining the current six-month rotating eu presidency .
a single face for foreign policy but there is one area where prodi clearly sees the need for a single voice : foreign policy .
he is calling for the creation of a single , powerful eu foreign minister who would be given more power and merge the global duties currently shared by javier solana , the eu 's high foreign policy representative , and chris patten , it 's external relations commissioner .
the position would be appointed by the commission president and eu member states and would be considered the commission 's vice president .
" national leaders should act on their commitment to make europe a superpower , " he told the parliament .
" speaking with one voice is essential to defend europe 's social model in a globalized world and protect our values . "
support may be limited prodi 's vision for a european constitutional framework with a strong federalist backbone is likely to create conflict with britain , france and spain , which favor greater sovereignty for member states .
but it is likely to be supported by germany and many of the smaller eu states , which prefer strengthening the triumvirate of power in brussels .
" he 's delivered an integrationist agenda with useful ideas , but one where member states are worried about the commission 's ability to take over those responsibilities , " heather grabbe , research director at the london-based center for european reform , told dw-world : " the commission 's proposal is acceptable to some of the member states , especially the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , but many others including france and britain are opposed to having more power for the commission - especially in areas of defense , foreign policy and taxation . "
grabbe believes opponents to prodi 's vision want to maintain veto powers in those policy areas . the commission released its plan just one month after giscard d 'estaing , who is heading the european constitutional convention , unveiled his own blueprint for a future european constitution .
among d 'estaing 's central proposals was the creation of a powerful eu president .

the right of member nations to veto legislation and regulations has made it difficult for the commission to assert authority in crucial areas ranging from contentious agricultural policies to defense . the shift would likely provide the eu with more authority on home and judicial affairs that could extend into taxation and defense .
simple majorities are the best way of avoiding legislative gridlock after the eu grows from 15 to 25 member states in 2004 , he argued .
no need for an eu president saying it would " cause more problems than it would solve , " prodi also rejected calls for a democratically elected european president and instead suggested that the commission president should be elected by a two-thirds majority in parliament , thus providing democratic legitimacy for the position .
an elected president " may enhance continuity and visibility of the union 's work , " said prodi .
" but it divests the member states - and it deprives us all - of an opportunity for close involvement in the european project .
quite frankly , such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : valery giscard d 'estaing france , britain , spain and eu convention president valery giscard d 'estaing -lrb- photo -rrb- have all called for the creation of a president of the european council - a single visage for the continent .
names from british prime minister tony blair to spanish prime minister jose maria aznar have been bandied about for the top slot .
but prodi said thursday he is in favor of maintaining the current six-month rotating eu presidency .
a single face for foreign policy but there is one area where prodi clearly sees the need for a single voice : foreign policy .
he is calling for the creation of a single , powerful eu foreign minister who would be given more power and merge the global duties currently shared by javier solana , the eu 's high foreign policy representative , and chris patten , it 's external relations commissioner .
the position would be appointed by the commission president and eu member states and would be considered the commission 's vice president .
" national leaders should act on their commitment to make europe a superpower , " he told the parliament .
" speaking with one voice is essential to defend europe 's social model in a globalized world and protect our values . "
support may be limited prodi 's vision for a european constitutional framework with a strong federalist backbone is likely to create conflict with britain , france and spain , which favor greater sovereignty for member states .
but it is likely to be supported by germany and many of the smaller eu states , which prefer strengthening the triumvirate of power in brussels .
" he 's delivered an integrationist agenda with useful ideas , but one where member states are worried about the commission 's ability to take over those responsibilities , " heather grabbe , research director at the london-based center for european reform , told dw-world : " the commission 's proposal is acceptable to some of the member states , especially the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , but many others including france and britain are opposed to having more power for the commission - especially in areas of defense , foreign policy and taxation . "
grabbe believes opponents to prodi 's vision want to maintain veto powers in those policy areas . the commission released its plan just one month after giscard d 'estaing , who is heading the european constitutional convention , unveiled his own blueprint for a future european constitution .
among d 'estaing 's central proposals was the creation of a powerful eu president .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .
topping the agenda is the role the eu should play in the reconstruction of iraq and deployment of humanitarian aid .
the majority of european countries are pleading for a leading role for the united nations - a demand the united states has viewed with considerable scepticism .
washington 's key european allies in the iraq war - britain , spain and denmark - have also questioned the extent to which the un should be engaged in the postwar persian gulf region . " the fulfilment of a dream " but bureaucrats in brussels like verheugen are optimistic that tensions over iraq wo n't distract from the historical magnitude of the athens summit .
there have been four previous expansions of the european union from the original six member states , but this will by far be the largest , with 10 new members . for the moment , at least , as the heads of state gather beneath the acropolis , the historical importance of european expansion will likely paper over the deep chasm in thinking between eu member states .
in addition to the heads of states from the existing 15 eu member states and 10 future members , united nations secretary general kofi annan will also attend the ceremony as well as the leaders of turkey , bulgaria , romania , croatia and serbia .

eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .
holding onto and extending power takes priority over problem solving , ” bert rürup recently told the german weekly stern . that 's why - instead of proposing revolutionary change all at once - rürup says he prefers incremental steps , hoping each will take hold and pave the way for further reforms : “ i would rather put through powerful reforms in small steps than propose a ‘ brilliant concept ’ likely to end up in the history -lrb- but not the law -rrb- books . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .

germany ’ s six leading economic institutes on tuesday dramatically cut their growth forecast for 2003 and urged the government to press ahead with painful social security and labor market reforms . in their spring report , the economic institutes said they only expected the german economy to grow 0.5 percent this year .
only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .
for 2004 , they cut their growth forecast from 2.25 percent to only 1.8 percent . the institutes said europe ’ s largest economy was likely to be blighted with sluggish growth and increasing unemployment for the foreseeable future , unless the german government continued with painful reforms to cut back the welfare state and liberalize the labor market . schröder ’ s reform package german chancellor gerhard schröder last month announced a package of sweeping proposals to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . though the six think-tanks endorsed the direction of the government ’ s reform proposals , the spring report also made clear that the institutes didn ’ t believe they went far enough to re-ignite the economy : “ if this agenda contains everything that is supposed to be implemented by 2010 , then conditions for growth will not improve considerably . ” in recent years , the german economy has stalled under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . increased pressure on the government the slashed 2003 growth forecast will likely increase pressure on the government to lower its own official forecast of one percent growth for this year .
that in turn could spell trouble for berlin and its budget deficit , which the institutes expect to reach 3.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 .
that would mean germany would break the european union ’ s three-percent limit for a second consecutive year . the institutes expect unemployment to average 4.45 million this year , compared with the government 's official forecast of 4.14 million .
unemployment is seen rising even further in 2004 to average 4.5 million , which would be an all-time record .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economy minister wolfgang clement but german economy and labor minister wolfgang clement dismissed the bleak outlook for the country ’ s joblessness , saying the government was on the right course . “ the institutes underestimate how dynamic our labor market reforms are , ” he said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

germany ’ s six leading economic institutes on tuesday dramatically cut their growth forecast for 2003 and urged the government to press ahead with painful social security and labor market reforms . in their spring report , the economic institutes said they only expected the german economy to grow 0.5 percent this year .
only six months ago they had expected 2003 growth at 1.4 percent . “ the german economy is stuck in a period of continuing weakness , ” said the report , which was officially presented by the institutes ’ chief economists in berlin on tuesday .
for 2004 , they cut their growth forecast from 2.25 percent to only 1.8 percent . the institutes said europe ’ s largest economy was likely to be blighted with sluggish growth and increasing unemployment for the foreseeable future , unless the german government continued with painful reforms to cut back the welfare state and liberalize the labor market . schröder ’ s reform package german chancellor gerhard schröder last month announced a package of sweeping proposals to revive flagging german growth and shore up the country ’ s creaky social security system . but his “ agenda 2010 ” plan has encountered massive criticism from trade unions and the left-wing faction of his own social democratic party .
at the heart of the reforms are proposals to cap unemployment benefits at 12 months and make it easier for small firms to hire and fire new workers . though the six think-tanks endorsed the direction of the government ’ s reform proposals , the spring report also made clear that the institutes didn ’ t believe they went far enough to re-ignite the economy : “ if this agenda contains everything that is supposed to be implemented by 2010 , then conditions for growth will not improve considerably . ” in recent years , the german economy has stalled under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 , its lowest annual rate since a recession in 1993 , and german unemployment is running at a five-year high of 11 percent . increased pressure on the government the slashed 2003 growth forecast will likely increase pressure on the government to lower its own official forecast of one percent growth for this year .
that in turn could spell trouble for berlin and its budget deficit , which the institutes expect to reach 3.4 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 .
that would mean germany would break the european union ’ s three-percent limit for a second consecutive year . the institutes expect unemployment to average 4.45 million this year , compared with the government 's official forecast of 4.14 million .
unemployment is seen rising even further in 2004 to average 4.5 million , which would be an all-time record .

recent efforts to modernize healthcare - a mainstay of the country ’ s social welfare system - illuminate the minefield awaiting would-be pension reformers .
the latest plan offers small relief . the rürup commission , a special government panel convened to address the healthcare and pension crisis facing germany , filed their first report on april 9 , consisting of their recommendations for germany ’ s ailing healthcare system . the plan is expected to reduce the cost of the public health care system - which has ballooned over the past decade - by € 24 billion -lrb- $ 25.9 billion -rrb- . taxpayers and patients would have to take on additional costs , such as paying a € 15 co-pay for trips to the doctor . the road to compromise was plagued by problems , with the panel ’ s 26 members battling to reconcile competing visions of the future . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bert rürup -lrb- left -rrb- and karl lauterbach have different visions of the future .
notably , the commission ’ s head , bert rürup , was involved in a very public debate with another member of the panel , karl lauterbach , an advisor to health minister ulla schmidt .
lauterbach lobbied to preserve but reform the current system , while rürup wanted more fundamental changes . as the public debate raged , chancellor schröder threatened to dissolve the panel , as a trickle of news stories in the press - such as a suggestion to introduce a € 200 flat rate premium - was alarming the public . the sensitive nature and political volatility of health care reform and relative light hand taken with this latest round of efforts demonstrates the difficulties that lie ahead .
the system needs to change - most experts agree - but its not clear that politicians have the political muscle to make it happen . a 19th century relic germany ’ s pension system is a product of the 19th century .
at that time the world was still a relatively orderly place : employment increased from generation to generation - as did the number of children . the working generation could comfortably finance - as part of the so-called “ contract between the generations ” - the retirement of those who preceded them .
and they were happy to do so , confident that the following generation would bankroll their twilight years . and so , in the 1950s , the “ pay as you go system ” evolved , with each generation devoting a percentage of their income to finance the public statutory pensions of the generation that preceded them .
at the time the contribution consisted of about 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income - a very manageable figure . in fact , the german pension system was so good , that the allies felt no need to fiddle with it following wwii .
but time marches on , and now this model , which was largely dependent on consistent growth and high employment , is under stress - a demographic and economic crisis are the culprits . system under stress over time , german citizens have become largely dependent on publicly funded statutory pension schemes - as opposed to taking out private insurance or relying on company schemes .
by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .
holding onto and extending power takes priority over problem solving , ” bert rürup recently told the german weekly stern . that 's why - instead of proposing revolutionary change all at once - rürup says he prefers incremental steps , hoping each will take hold and pave the way for further reforms : “ i would rather put through powerful reforms in small steps than propose a ‘ brilliant concept ’ likely to end up in the history -lrb- but not the law -rrb- books . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 16.04.2003 iraq threatens to overshadow eu expansion summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europeans want to make history for the second time at athens ' acropolis .
eu expansion architects in brussels intended for this week 's summit in athens to mark an unprecedented moment in the growth of the union .
but with members still split over the iraq war , tensions could flare . originally , it was meant to be a photo op .
the european union wanted to celebrate the ceremonious signing of the accession treaty for its 10 new member states at the acropolis in athens , the cradle of ancient greek democracy .
the expansion will increase membership in the eu from 15 to 25 , bringing in many formerly communist eastern european countries into the fray and driving the final nail in the coffin of the cold war . " this step finally breaks through the east and west divide of the european continent , the political division of its states and the painful division of its people , that resulted as a consequence of world war ii , " stated the draft of a speech to be given by german chancellor gerhard schröder on wednesday . though the popping of flashes is still on the calendar , what was intended as a historical gesture has now spun into a full-fledged eu summit with the war in iraq wresting control of the agenda . for weeks now , the eu has been divided by seemingly irreconcilable differences over the washington-led campaign against iraq .
the difficulties were exacerbated when a number of accession states publicly lined up in support of the united states and britain in an open letter published by the wall street journal europe . " irresponsible behaviour " incensed by the move , french president jacques chirac issued a terse warning to the eastern europeans in february : " it is not really responsible behavior .
they missed a good opportunity to keep quiet . " since then , the chief architect of the eu 's eastward expansion , günter verheugen , has pleaded with his colleagues in brussels and other european capitals to look ahead rather than to dwell on temporary divisions and to avoid forcing the future eu members to make a difficult choice between their alliance with europe and their transatlantic ally , the united states . " in principle , it 's right for a number of the new member states to have a very strong , very emotional relationship to the united states that they do n't want to abandon , " verheugen said .
" and why not ?
it 's certainly not anti-european to have a good relationship with america . ...
we need to avoid situations where countries are forced to choose between europe and america . " global responsibilities in athens , europe 's heads of states and governments are meeting for the first time after the de facto end of the war in iraq .
against that backdrop , the issue threatens to overshadow the signing of the accession treaty . the greek presidency of the european union directly addressed the conflict in a draft of a declaration expected to be released on wednesday afternoon after the treaties of accession are signed .
" in the wake of the war in iraq , we are committed to facing up to our global responsibilities , " it read .
" we will support conflict prevention , promote justice , help secure peace and defend global stability . "
the declaration calls for an " important " or " essential " role for the united nations in postwar iraq . but it 's clear the eu wants to make reconciliatory overtures to washington .
speaking on the eve of the summit tuesday , greek prime minister costas simitas told reporters : " we must do everything to reinforce the transatlantic dialogue and avoid any worsening of relations between europe and the united states . " and on his way to athens on tuesday , british prime minister tony blair stopped in hanover in an effort to forge a common position with german chancellor gerhard schröder , one of the most vocal opponents of the iraq war .
members of the british delegation told reuters the meeting , which focused primarily on reconstruction efforts , was " very good and very constructive . "
both blair and schröder have lobbied washington to give the green light for a u.n. role in rebuilding iraq . however , differences of opinion between washington and brussels are expected to persist - at least in the short run . the most-heated issues expected to be tabled at the summit already surfaced at a meeting between eu foreign ministers in luxembourg on monday .
topping the agenda is the role the eu should play in the reconstruction of iraq and deployment of humanitarian aid .
the majority of european countries are pleading for a leading role for the united nations - a demand the united states has viewed with considerable scepticism .
washington 's key european allies in the iraq war - britain , spain and denmark - have also questioned the extent to which the un should be engaged in the postwar persian gulf region . " the fulfilment of a dream " but bureaucrats in brussels like verheugen are optimistic that tensions over iraq wo n't distract from the historical magnitude of the athens summit .
there have been four previous expansions of the european union from the original six member states , but this will by far be the largest , with 10 new members . for the moment , at least , as the heads of state gather beneath the acropolis , the historical importance of european expansion will likely paper over the deep chasm in thinking between eu member states .
in addition to the heads of states from the existing 15 eu member states and 10 future members , united nations secretary general kofi annan will also attend the ceremony as well as the leaders of turkey , bulgaria , romania , croatia and serbia . " i have to say , this is really the fulfilment of a dream , " verheugen said .
" when i first got started in brussels , i did n't think this would be possible , but we 've succeeded .

by 2002 , 80 percent of retired germans relied on public pensions , while only 15 percent turned to private plans and an even smaller number -lrb- 5 percent -rrb- to company schemes . yet the price the current working generation pays to sustain these benefits has steadily increased .
as opposed to the original 7 percent of an employee ’ s gross income , today that figure is 20 percent .
“ things are worse than suggested even a year ago , ” says christian zahn , a board member of the bfa , germany 's social security office . “ if you go according to the government ’ s own figures about economic development , the contribution rate will remain steady at about 19.5 percent over the next few years -lrb- not decline , as many politicians are promising -rrb- .
and if economic circumstances change for the worse , one can ’ t rule out even higher rates by 2006 . ” what ’ s more , the pay-as-you go system has been stressed by rising unemployment , falling birthrates and increased life expectancy .
and the costs of german re-unification have compounded the problem .
when the pension system was conceived in 1957 , one hundred working age citizens financed the benefits of 31.4 retirees . today that figure is 52 . the pension system only functions today because it is subsidized by the federal government and the benefits paid out have been decreased , changing from a percentage of one ’ s -lrb- considerably higher -rrb- gross pay to a percentage of net pay .
despite all the problems , change has been slow . a sacred cow “ take note : pensions are safe . ”
so goes the familiar quote from norbert blüm , the long-serving labor and social minister under helmut kohl .
these words became the mantra of other politicians , eager to secure their place in the hearts of voters .
health care and pensions were largely considered hallowed ground . but when blüm vacated his post in 1997 cracks in the façade were clearly visible . a year later gerhard schröder was elected chancellor , and a coalition of social democrats and greens made tentative steps to tackle the issue .
expectations were high , and many political observers wondered if the new government had the necessary backbone to push through change . first efforts at reform one of the new governing coalition 's first acts was to introduce an “ environmental tax ” on energy , electricity , and , most importantly , gasoline .
they hoped the proceeds from this tax would help decrease pension contributions , and , as a consequence , the percentage deducted from each working person ’ s salary . and indeed , it did - if only slightly .
the percentage deducted sank from 20.3 percent of gross income in 1998 to 19.1 percent in 2001 . but it soon become clear that this trend would not continue , and further reforms were necessary .
next the social democrats and greens proposed the so-called “ riester rente ” in 2001 , named after then-labor minister walter riester .
by offering incentives , the reform was meant to encourage people to take out private pensions or turn to company options . two years later , in march 2003 , chancellor schröder commended them as a benchmark of change . “ the pension reform of 2001 is the most important pension-related decision since the introduction of the pay-as-you go system in 1957 .
by the end of last year , the number of private pension programs taken out by individuals has grown to 3.4 million , and the number of company pension schemes has increased to 2.4 million .
of the 35 million workerrrs in this country , these figures represent 15 percent .
that ’ s surely not enough , but given that it ’ s only been a year , these are impressive results . ” the latest efforts however , critics claimed the riester reforms were too confusing and complicated for the average citizen , and low-income families were at a disadvantage .
thus , after the november elections in 2002 , schröder and the spd voiced a new commitment to further reform , subsequently establishing the rürup commission and empowering its members to come up with solutions to finance germany ’ s unwieldy social welfare system - both healthcare and pensions . but if the recent report is anything to go by , progress will be slow . “ you can only sell reform to politicians when you can guarantee results within their term .
holding onto and extending power takes priority over problem solving , ” bert rürup recently told the german weekly stern . that 's why - instead of proposing revolutionary change all at once - rürup says he prefers incremental steps , hoping each will take hold and pave the way for further reforms : “ i would rather put through powerful reforms in small steps than propose a ‘ brilliant concept ’ likely to end up in the history -lrb- but not the law -rrb- books . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder faces fight at spd congress on reform agenda german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday tied his political fate to a special party congress on the government ’ s controversial plans to reform the welfare state and spur the economy .

in a speech before the european parliament , european commission president romano prodi rejected calls for the creation of a powerful eu president by countries like great britain and france .
prodi said the power should reside with the policy-initiating commission and the 626-member european parliament .
he proposed establishing a foreign minister for the eu who would become the body 's " single voice " on international issues .
" it is no longer just a question of ensuring the institutions work properly after enlargement , " prodi said .
" it must work out the overall shape of the union for generations to come . "
" prodi 's bible " the commission president submitted his draft to parliament in a 17-page , bound red pocket book , which has been dubbed " prodi 's bible . "
among the primary commandments listed is prodi 's call for the abolition of the right to veto held by member states .
describing unanimity as one of the " bleakest periods " of eu history , prodi said he would only support the requirement in cases of " constitutional importance " and instead insisted on the acceptance of qualified majorities in most eu decisions .
the right of member nations to veto legislation and regulations has made it difficult for the commission to assert authority in crucial areas ranging from contentious agricultural policies to defense . the shift would likely provide the eu with more authority on home and judicial affairs that could extend into taxation and defense .
simple majorities are the best way of avoiding legislative gridlock after the eu grows from 15 to 25 member states in 2004 , he argued .
no need for an eu president saying it would " cause more problems than it would solve , " prodi also rejected calls for a democratically elected european president and instead suggested that the commission president should be elected by a two-thirds majority in parliament , thus providing democratic legitimacy for the position .
an elected president " may enhance continuity and visibility of the union 's work , " said prodi .
" but it divests the member states - and it deprives us all - of an opportunity for close involvement in the european project .
quite frankly , such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure . "

names from british prime minister tony blair to spanish prime minister jose maria aznar have been bandied about for the top slot .
but prodi said thursday he is in favor of maintaining the current six-month rotating eu presidency .
a single face for foreign policy but there is one area where prodi clearly sees the need for a single voice : foreign policy .
he is calling for the creation of a single , powerful eu foreign minister who would be given more power and merge the global duties currently shared by javier solana , the eu 's high foreign policy representative , and chris patten , it 's external relations commissioner .
the position would be appointed by the commission president and eu member states and would be considered the commission 's vice president .
" national leaders should act on their commitment to make europe a superpower , " he told the parliament .
" speaking with one voice is essential to defend europe 's social model in a globalized world and protect our values . "
support may be limited prodi 's vision for a european constitutional framework with a strong federalist backbone is likely to create conflict with britain , france and spain , which favor greater sovereignty for member states .
but it is likely to be supported by germany and many of the smaller eu states , which prefer strengthening the triumvirate of power in brussels .
" he 's delivered an integrationist agenda with useful ideas , but one where member states are worried about the commission 's ability to take over those responsibilities , " heather grabbe , research director at the london-based center for european reform , told dw-world : " the commission 's proposal is acceptable to some of the member states , especially the benelux countries -lrb- belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg -rrb- , but many others including france and britain are opposed to having more power for the commission - especially in areas of defense , foreign policy and taxation . "
grabbe believes opponents to prodi 's vision want to maintain veto powers in those policy areas . the commission released its plan just one month after giscard d 'estaing , who is heading the european constitutional convention , unveiled his own blueprint for a future european constitution .

no need for an eu president saying it would " cause more problems than it would solve , " prodi also rejected calls for a democratically elected european president and instead suggested that the commission president should be elected by a two-thirds majority in parliament , thus providing democratic legitimacy for the position .
an elected president " may enhance continuity and visibility of the union 's work , " said prodi .

in a speech before the european parliament , european commission president romano prodi rejected calls for the creation of a powerful eu president by countries like great britain and france .
prodi said the power should reside with the policy-initiating commission and the 626-member european parliament .
he proposed establishing a foreign minister for the eu who would become the body 's " single voice " on international issues .
" it is no longer just a question of ensuring the institutions work properly after enlargement , " prodi said .
" it must work out the overall shape of the union for generations to come . "
" prodi 's bible " the commission president submitted his draft to parliament in a 17-page , bound red pocket book , which has been dubbed " prodi 's bible . "
among the primary commandments listed is prodi 's call for the abolition of the right to veto held by member states .
describing unanimity as one of the " bleakest periods " of eu history , prodi said he would only support the requirement in cases of " constitutional importance " and instead insisted on the acceptance of qualified majorities in most eu decisions .
the right of member nations to veto legislation and regulations has made it difficult for the commission to assert authority in crucial areas ranging from contentious agricultural policies to defense . the shift would likely provide the eu with more authority on home and judicial affairs that could extend into taxation and defense .
simple majorities are the best way of avoiding legislative gridlock after the eu grows from 15 to 25 member states in 2004 , he argued .
no need for an eu president saying it would " cause more problems than it would solve , " prodi also rejected calls for a democratically elected european president and instead suggested that the commission president should be elected by a two-thirds majority in parliament , thus providing democratic legitimacy for the position .
an elected president " may enhance continuity and visibility of the union 's work , " said prodi .
" but it divests the member states - and it deprives us all - of an opportunity for close involvement in the european project .
quite frankly , such a position would open a rift in our institutional structure . "

names from british prime minister tony blair to spanish prime minister jose maria aznar have been bandied about for the top slot .
but prodi said thursday he is in favor of maintaining the current six-month rotating eu presidency .
a single face for foreign policy but there is one area where prodi clearly sees the need for a single voice : foreign policy .
he is calling for the creation of a single , powerful eu foreign minister who would be given more power and merge the global duties currently shared by javier solana , the eu 's high foreign policy representative , and chris patten , it 's external relations commissioner .
the position would be appointed by the commission president and eu member states and would be considered the commission 's vice president .

the gulf co-operation council -lrb- gcc -rrb- - whose members control nearly half the world 's known oil reserves - also said that setting up a transitional government in us-occupied iraq was an urgent priority .
us officials have accused syria of harbouring members of the former iraqi regime and developing weapons of mass destruction - allegations that damascus denies .
economic and diplomatic sanctions have been threatened , and some us government spokesmen have refused to rule out military action .
tuesday saw us defence secretary donald rumsfeld confirm that a pipeline supplying iraqi oil to syria , apparently in contravention of united nations sanctions , had been " shut off " .
later , us officials said a former leading member of the iraqi intelligence service , farouk hijazi , was believed to be in syria .

rumsfeld has accused the syrians of supplying the iraqi military " we hope that syria understands now that there is a new environment in the region with the end of the regime of saddam hussein , and that syria will reconsider its policies of past years , " he said .
ties between the us and syria have long been strained by us support for israel and syria 's backing of the lebanese group hezbollah and radical palestinian groups , which washington considers terrorist organisations .
a statement released by the syrian government on tuesday condemned us " threats and falsifications " , saying that the " escalated language of threats and accusations by some american officials against syria " was aimed at " damaging its steadfastness " .

rumsfeld has accused the syrians of supplying the iraqi military " we hope that syria understands now that there is a new environment in the region with the end of the regime of saddam hussein , and that syria will reconsider its policies of past years , " he said .
ties between the us and syria have long been strained by us support for israel and syria 's backing of the lebanese group hezbollah and radical palestinian groups , which washington considers terrorist organisations .
a statement released by the syrian government on tuesday condemned us " threats and falsifications " , saying that the " escalated language of threats and accusations by some american officials against syria " was aimed at " damaging its steadfastness " .
" the cabinet rejected these accusations and allegations and saw them as a response to israeli stimulus and a service to its -lsb- israel 's -rsb- goals and expansive greed , " the statement added .
un resolution and in an apparent response to the us accusations , syria is preparing to introduce a resolution at the un security council on wednesday , calling for the middle east to be declared a " zone free of weapons of mass destruction " - a clear reference to israel 's nuclear weapons programme .
the arab league ambassador to the un , yahya mahmassani , said us allegations against syria were " unacceptable and unfounded " .
" the arab world is already engulfed with anger and frustration , " he said .
both the uk and spain , crucial us allies in the war in iraq , have declined to support the us over syria .
un secretary general kofi annan has expressed concern that recent statements about syria may further destabilise the middle east .

by james arnold bbc news online business reporter a threat to western prosperity ?
in february , the european commission advertised for 1,000 temporary workers to stuff envelopes and lick stamps during the eu enlargement process .
but instead of the couple of thousand applications the eurocrats were expecting , 25,000 cvs gushed into brussels - more than 21,000 of which were from poland , hungary , the czech republic and the eu 's other prospective new members .
for many west of the former iron curtain , incidents like this sound an economic warning bell .
this week , those countries ' leaders are gathering in athens to sign the enlargement process irrevocably into being .
could they - as many sceptics fear - also be signing away europe 's cosy prosperity ?
labour pains politically , the athens gathering is something of a triumph .
getting 15 argumentative nations to agree terms with 10 equally quarrelsome former enemies is a huge achievement , notwithstanding the fact that much remains to be finalised .
but it is economics , rather than politics , that gives critics of eu enlargement sleepless nights .
concerns over the fall-out from enlargement are in three broad categories .
first , there are worries that europe 's labour markets will be put under strain .
the unemployed or underpaid millions of eastern europe , it is felt , are already pouring west ; throwing the labour market open will only accelerate that exodus , swamping the west while draining the east of precious talent .
at the same time , workers in the west , especially germany and austria , fear that ever more of their jobs will be exported to hungary and poland , where labour costs are about one-fifth of the eu average .
not to be trusted second , westerners fret that eu enlargement could dent the union 's economic prestige .
not sophisticated enough for the west ?
east europeans certainly are poor : the accession of the 10 leading candidates will raise the eu 's population by one-quarter , but its total economic output will increase only by 4 % .
all the candidates have slick-seeming economic machinery - central banks , stock markets , bond markets and the like - but few in the west feel they have the wisdom or experience to inspire the trust of the financial community .
the fact that few east european countries seem to stick with the same government for more than one term , and that the region 's communists and other extremists refuse to lie down and die , means the candidate countries still have a faintly maverick reputation .
many hands make heavy work third and most pressing , no-one is sure what enlargement will do to the eu 's already unwieldy administration .
we 'll need some more seats in here for a start poorer regions in the west fret that brussels subsidies will be diverted to plainly needier recipients in the east ; farmers fear that europe 's vast agricultural budget will be guzzled away by the numberless and inefficient smallholders of central europe .
nor is it trivial to be concerned about how the eu will make decisions when it has 25 members .
even the logistics of arranging translation into 21 official languages , rather than the current 11 , boggle the mind .
flexible friends in fact , none of these three bundles of worries are as knotty as they seem .
labour markets certainly are due for a shake-up ; many east europeans , especially young people , are far more desperate to work in the west than their governments like to admit .
but the much-feared barbarian invasion is unlikely : wage differentials on either side of the divide are already equalising , and western governments have done their best to dissuade casual job-seekers .
in any case , the european economy is in sore need of freer movement of labour .
one of the issues that has prevented the eurozone becoming a homogeneous continental economy like the united states is that its population has been reluctant to move in search of work .
up to speed nor should the west fear the loss of its prestige too much .
eastern europe may be poor , but it is willing .
behind the occasionally ramshackle facades of the candidate countries lie bodies of legislation that in most cases way exceed eu standards .
almost all the countries fulfil maastricht criteria for adoption of the single currency , although they do not have to do that until two years after they join the eu .
and while western europe 's economy is growing at just over 1 % a year , the east is expanding at four times the rate .
the financial markets certainly anticipate no loss of prestige : most east european currencies have appreciated against the euro in recent years , and the region 's credit is reckoned as good as much in the west .
poverty row justified worries still hang over the eu 's budget , however , despite a deal struck last year to delay subsidies to candidate countries .
brussels wo n't make hungary 's farmers rich it is still far from clear how seriously voters in poor western regions such as extremadura in spain or calabria in italy will react to the enrichment of the east .
so far , concern seems only marginal , reflecting perhaps the fact that most europeans have only a hazy engagement with eu issues .
indeed , brussels may get away without a major fuss on the issue : the current policy of niggardliness and jam-tomorrow promises has prevented the issue taking off in the west , and most candidate countries have been too polite to kick up a storm .
cuts both ways which raises a question : just why is eu enlargement seen as such a one-way street ?
in some ways , brussels has more to gain from expanding the union than the new members have from joining .
about to get tied up in red tape the 10 candidate countries already enjoy the trade privileges , and quite a bit of the subsidy , that they would get as eu members .
nor is the promise of future subsidy quite as generous as it was : thanks to reductions and delays , most candidate countries will be worse off in their first year of eu membership than they were before , according to a commission report last year .
tied down at the same time , new members will have to tighten their belts to fit in with eu strictures .
imposing maastricht rules on budget deficits will crimp government spending at a time when many in the east are still reliant on the state for their livelihood .
eastern europe 's relatively free-and-easy economies will have to become more bundled in red tape , especially regarding environmental regulations .
and if anyone is worried about a loss of economic prestige , surely it should be the east europeans - after all , the eu 's sluggish growth and unbudgeably high unemployment are scarcely something to aspire towards .
forget working in brussels ; the clever cvs will be heading in the other direction .

by james arnold bbc news online business reporter a threat to western prosperity ?
in february , the european commission advertised for 1,000 temporary workers to stuff envelopes and lick stamps during the eu enlargement process .
but instead of the couple of thousand applications the eurocrats were expecting , 25,000 cvs gushed into brussels - more than 21,000 of which were from poland , hungary , the czech republic and the eu 's other prospective new members .
for many west of the former iron curtain , incidents like this sound an economic warning bell .
this week , those countries ' leaders are gathering in athens to sign the enlargement process irrevocably into being .
could they - as many sceptics fear - also be signing away europe 's cosy prosperity ?
labour pains politically , the athens gathering is something of a triumph .
getting 15 argumentative nations to agree terms with 10 equally quarrelsome former enemies is a huge achievement , notwithstanding the fact that much remains to be finalised .
but it is economics , rather than politics , that gives critics of eu enlargement sleepless nights .
concerns over the fall-out from enlargement are in three broad categories .
first , there are worries that europe 's labour markets will be put under strain .
the unemployed or underpaid millions of eastern europe , it is felt , are already pouring west ; throwing the labour market open will only accelerate that exodus , swamping the west while draining the east of precious talent .
at the same time , workers in the west , especially germany and austria , fear that ever more of their jobs will be exported to hungary and poland , where labour costs are about one-fifth of the eu average .
not to be trusted second , westerners fret that eu enlargement could dent the union 's economic prestige .
not sophisticated enough for the west ?
east europeans certainly are poor : the accession of the 10 leading candidates will raise the eu 's population by one-quarter , but its total economic output will increase only by 4 % .
all the candidates have slick-seeming economic machinery - central banks , stock markets , bond markets and the like - but few in the west feel they have the wisdom or experience to inspire the trust of the financial community .
the fact that few east european countries seem to stick with the same government for more than one term , and that the region 's communists and other extremists refuse to lie down and die , means the candidate countries still have a faintly maverick reputation .
many hands make heavy work third and most pressing , no-one is sure what enlargement will do to the eu 's already unwieldy administration .
we 'll need some more seats in here for a start poorer regions in the west fret that brussels subsidies will be diverted to plainly needier recipients in the east ; farmers fear that europe 's vast agricultural budget will be guzzled away by the numberless and inefficient smallholders of central europe .
nor is it trivial to be concerned about how the eu will make decisions when it has 25 members .
even the logistics of arranging translation into 21 official languages , rather than the current 11 , boggle the mind .
flexible friends in fact , none of these three bundles of worries are as knotty as they seem .
labour markets certainly are due for a shake-up ; many east europeans , especially young people , are far more desperate to work in the west than their governments like to admit .
but the much-feared barbarian invasion is unlikely : wage differentials on either side of the divide are already equalising , and western governments have done their best to dissuade casual job-seekers .
in any case , the european economy is in sore need of freer movement of labour .
one of the issues that has prevented the eurozone becoming a homogeneous continental economy like the united states is that its population has been reluctant to move in search of work .
up to speed nor should the west fear the loss of its prestige too much .
eastern europe may be poor , but it is willing .
behind the occasionally ramshackle facades of the candidate countries lie bodies of legislation that in most cases way exceed eu standards .
almost all the countries fulfil maastricht criteria for adoption of the single currency , although they do not have to do that until two years after they join the eu .
and while western europe 's economy is growing at just over 1 % a year , the east is expanding at four times the rate .
the financial markets certainly anticipate no loss of prestige : most east european currencies have appreciated against the euro in recent years , and the region 's credit is reckoned as good as much in the west .
poverty row justified worries still hang over the eu 's budget , however , despite a deal struck last year to delay subsidies to candidate countries .
brussels wo n't make hungary 's farmers rich it is still far from clear how seriously voters in poor western regions such as extremadura in spain or calabria in italy will react to the enrichment of the east .
so far , concern seems only marginal , reflecting perhaps the fact that most europeans have only a hazy engagement with eu issues .
indeed , brussels may get away without a major fuss on the issue : the current policy of niggardliness and jam-tomorrow promises has prevented the issue taking off in the west , and most candidate countries have been too polite to kick up a storm .
cuts both ways which raises a question : just why is eu enlargement seen as such a one-way street ?
in some ways , brussels has more to gain from expanding the union than the new members have from joining .
about to get tied up in red tape the 10 candidate countries already enjoy the trade privileges , and quite a bit of the subsidy , that they would get as eu members .
nor is the promise of future subsidy quite as generous as it was : thanks to reductions and delays , most candidate countries will be worse off in their first year of eu membership than they were before , according to a commission report last year .
tied down at the same time , new members will have to tighten their belts to fit in with eu strictures .
imposing maastricht rules on budget deficits will crimp government spending at a time when many in the east are still reliant on the state for their livelihood .
eastern europe 's relatively free-and-easy economies will have to become more bundled in red tape , especially regarding environmental regulations .

it calls on the kirk 's general assembly to show regret for its record on protecting victims of domestic abuse .
the report from the kirk 's church and nation committee criticises theologians for being " virtually silent " on the issue .
it goes on to ask why the church has " in many instances condoned sexual harassment and even violence within its own institutional life " .
material support the general assembly , which meets next month , is being called upon to recognise that the kirk can do better when it comes to dealing with the problem .
the committee wants pastoral response guidelines to go to all ministers and deacons .
it also wants families who are abused by ministers or church employees to be given financial and material support .
the report highlights the case of a " professional man and church elder " who abused and harassed his wife and children for more than 20 years and a minister who " habitually subjected his wife to degrading sexual demands " .
it states : " christians of goodwill , evangelical and liberal , roman catholic and orthodox are increasingly recognising that violence against women in all its forms including domestic abuse is a sin and offence against god . "
the assembly will also be asked to commend the scottish parliament and scottish executive 's policies on domestic abuse and politicians ' support for the scottish partnership for domestic abuse .
and the committee will recommend an overhaul of the kirk 's approach to domestic violence , including addressing the issue at universities and the department of ministry .
