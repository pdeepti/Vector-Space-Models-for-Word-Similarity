a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a barge navigates around sandbanks in the rhine river near duisburg on july 16 , 2003 , after extreme heat and drought caused the water to dry up .
record draught causes damage germany has received only about half it ’ s normal yearly rainfall .
in many parts of the country the water level in rivers has reached its lowest level in a century .
on parts of the elbe and danube , ship traffic has come to a complete halt .
on the rhine , barges can only travel with reduced loads .
in the eastern half of the country and in parts of eastern europe , not a single drop of rain has fallen in weeks .
the ground is drying up and there ’ s a real danger of forest fires as vegetation becomes brittle .
franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .
making matters worse , the spring started off with unusually cool , wet periods .
" the whole year has really been a bad one .
we have regions , where there was at first a surplus of rain and now a drought , " feitner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matterhorn on july 15 , 2003 , where mountaineers are being evacuated after an avalanche .
geologists say the unusually warm weather is responsible for the rock slide since the permafrost is melting .
climactic warnings or normal ups and downs ?
but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .
in the alps , the record temperatures have caused glaciers , such as the one on the matterhorn , to start melting .
as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .
meteorologists in germany are not anticipating any long-term relief in the heat wave .
after a slight reprieve and a sprinkling of rain at the beginning of the week , temperatures are expected to rise again upwards of 30 degrees .

the showdown in the pyrenees between lance armstrong and jan ullrich just got hotter after third-seated alexander vinokourov launched his attack in the 14th stage .
only 18 seconds separates the trio from one another . jan ullrich , lance armstrong and alexander vinokourov are battling it out for yellow in the pyrenees .
after a second day of head-to-head racing between ullrich , who gave the fight of his life on friday and saturday , and top-ranked armstrong , the race for the yellow jersey kicked up a notch in the 14th stage as vinokourov pushed ahead , taking 43 seconds off the leading duo .
vinokourov , third in the overall tour standing , produced one of his best rides on sunday .
eight kilometers short of the stage ’ s last hill at the peyresourde pass , he launched an all-out attack and crossed the finish line in loudenvielle sixth , 41 seconds behind the stage ’ s surprise winner gilberto simoni of italy .
narrowing the lead at the end of the 191.5 kilometer race over six climbs , armstrong , who came in 11th with ullrich trailing right behind him , just barely managed to hold onto his first-place seating .

the distance between ullrich and vinokourov is even more precarious : just three seconds .
ullrich was speechless after seeing his hopes for the yellow jersey once again slip out of his reach .
his team manager rudy pevenage told reporters he didn ’ t understand why ullrich held back on following vinokourov on the attack .

the showdown in the pyrenees between lance armstrong and jan ullrich just got hotter after third-seated alexander vinokourov launched his attack in the 14th stage .
only 18 seconds separates the trio from one another . jan ullrich , lance armstrong and alexander vinokourov are battling it out for yellow in the pyrenees .
after a second day of head-to-head racing between ullrich , who gave the fight of his life on friday and saturday , and top-ranked armstrong , the race for the yellow jersey kicked up a notch in the 14th stage as vinokourov pushed ahead , taking 43 seconds off the leading duo .

a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a barge navigates around sandbanks in the rhine river near duisburg on july 16 , 2003 , after extreme heat and drought caused the water to dry up .
record draught causes damage germany has received only about half it ’ s normal yearly rainfall .
in many parts of the country the water level in rivers has reached its lowest level in a century .
on parts of the elbe and danube , ship traffic has come to a complete halt .
on the rhine , barges can only travel with reduced loads .
in the eastern half of the country and in parts of eastern europe , not a single drop of rain has fallen in weeks .
the ground is drying up and there ’ s a real danger of forest fires as vegetation becomes brittle .
franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .
making matters worse , the spring started off with unusually cool , wet periods .
" the whole year has really been a bad one .
we have regions , where there was at first a surplus of rain and now a drought , " feitner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matterhorn on july 15 , 2003 , where mountaineers are being evacuated after an avalanche .
geologists say the unusually warm weather is responsible for the rock slide since the permafrost is melting .
climactic warnings or normal ups and downs ?
but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .
in the alps , the record temperatures have caused glaciers , such as the one on the matterhorn , to start melting .
as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .
meteorologists in germany are not anticipating any long-term relief in the heat wave .
after a slight reprieve and a sprinkling of rain at the beginning of the week , temperatures are expected to rise again upwards of 30 degrees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.07.2003 blair refuses to resign over death of iraq expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front pages of london newspapers on saturday july 19 focus on government involvement in the death of david kelly .
british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , left , is welcomed by japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi as he arrives at the mountain hot spring resort of hakone in japan saturday , july 19 , 2003 .
" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .
" there is an assumption running that actually the whole issue ... was just a strange invention of the cia or british intelligence , " he said in japan and then added , " it certainly was not .
i believe that intelligence to be genuine .

on parts of the elbe and danube , ship traffic has come to a complete halt .
on the rhine , barges can only travel with reduced loads .
in the eastern half of the country and in parts of eastern europe , not a single drop of rain has fallen in weeks .
the ground is drying up and there ’ s a real danger of forest fires as vegetation becomes brittle .
franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .
making matters worse , the spring started off with unusually cool , wet periods .
" the whole year has really been a bad one .
we have regions , where there was at first a surplus of rain and now a drought , " feitner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matterhorn on july 15 , 2003 , where mountaineers are being evacuated after an avalanche .
geologists say the unusually warm weather is responsible for the rock slide since the permafrost is melting .
climactic warnings or normal ups and downs ?
but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .
in the alps , the record temperatures have caused glaciers , such as the one on the matterhorn , to start melting .
as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .
meteorologists in germany are not anticipating any long-term relief in the heat wave .
after a slight reprieve and a sprinkling of rain at the beginning of the week , temperatures are expected to rise again upwards of 30 degrees .
that means europe ’ s farmers will continue to wait for rain and everyone else will sweat it out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with a rising disaster dw-world looks at the social , economic and political effects of the century 's worst flood in germany -lrb- aug .

british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .

" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .

british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .

earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .

british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , left , is welcomed by japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi as he arrives at the mountain hot spring resort of hakone in japan saturday , july 19 , 2003 .
" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .

a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a barge navigates around sandbanks in the rhine river near duisburg on july 16 , 2003 , after extreme heat and drought caused the water to dry up .
record draught causes damage germany has received only about half it ’ s normal yearly rainfall .
in many parts of the country the water level in rivers has reached its lowest level in a century .
on parts of the elbe and danube , ship traffic has come to a complete halt .
on the rhine , barges can only travel with reduced loads .
in the eastern half of the country and in parts of eastern europe , not a single drop of rain has fallen in weeks .
the ground is drying up and there ’ s a real danger of forest fires as vegetation becomes brittle .
franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .
making matters worse , the spring started off with unusually cool , wet periods .
" the whole year has really been a bad one .
we have regions , where there was at first a surplus of rain and now a drought , " feitner said .

but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .
in the alps , the record temperatures have caused glaciers , such as the one on the matterhorn , to start melting .
as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .
meteorologists in germany are not anticipating any long-term relief in the heat wave .

with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .

" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.07.2003 blair refuses to resign over death of iraq expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front pages of london newspapers on saturday july 19 focus on government involvement in the death of david kelly .
british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , left , is welcomed by japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi as he arrives at the mountain hot spring resort of hakone in japan saturday , july 19 , 2003 .
" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .
" there is an assumption running that actually the whole issue ... was just a strange invention of the cia or british intelligence , " he said in japan and then added , " it certainly was not .
i believe that intelligence to be genuine .

after a second day of head-to-head racing between ullrich , who gave the fight of his life on friday and saturday , and top-ranked armstrong , the race for the yellow jersey kicked up a notch in the 14th stage as vinokourov pushed ahead , taking 43 seconds off the leading duo .
vinokourov , third in the overall tour standing , produced one of his best rides on sunday .
eight kilometers short of the stage ’ s last hill at the peyresourde pass , he launched an all-out attack and crossed the finish line in loudenvielle sixth , 41 seconds behind the stage ’ s surprise winner gilberto simoni of italy .
narrowing the lead at the end of the 191.5 kilometer race over six climbs , armstrong , who came in 11th with ullrich trailing right behind him , just barely managed to hold onto his first-place seating .

a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a barge navigates around sandbanks in the rhine river near duisburg on july 16 , 2003 , after extreme heat and drought caused the water to dry up .
record draught causes damage germany has received only about half it ’ s normal yearly rainfall .
in many parts of the country the water level in rivers has reached its lowest level in a century .
on parts of the elbe and danube , ship traffic has come to a complete halt .
on the rhine , barges can only travel with reduced loads .
in the eastern half of the country and in parts of eastern europe , not a single drop of rain has fallen in weeks .
the ground is drying up and there ’ s a real danger of forest fires as vegetation becomes brittle .
franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .
making matters worse , the spring started off with unusually cool , wet periods .
" the whole year has really been a bad one .
we have regions , where there was at first a surplus of rain and now a drought , " feitner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matterhorn on july 15 , 2003 , where mountaineers are being evacuated after an avalanche .
geologists say the unusually warm weather is responsible for the rock slide since the permafrost is melting .
climactic warnings or normal ups and downs ?
but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .
in the alps , the record temperatures have caused glaciers , such as the one on the matterhorn , to start melting .
as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .
meteorologists in germany are not anticipating any long-term relief in the heat wave .
after a slight reprieve and a sprinkling of rain at the beginning of the week , temperatures are expected to rise again upwards of 30 degrees .

the showdown in the pyrenees between lance armstrong and jan ullrich just got hotter after third-seated alexander vinokourov launched his attack in the 14th stage .
only 18 seconds separates the trio from one another . jan ullrich , lance armstrong and alexander vinokourov are battling it out for yellow in the pyrenees .
after a second day of head-to-head racing between ullrich , who gave the fight of his life on friday and saturday , and top-ranked armstrong , the race for the yellow jersey kicked up a notch in the 14th stage as vinokourov pushed ahead , taking 43 seconds off the leading duo .
vinokourov , third in the overall tour standing , produced one of his best rides on sunday .
eight kilometers short of the stage ’ s last hill at the peyresourde pass , he launched an all-out attack and crossed the finish line in loudenvielle sixth , 41 seconds behind the stage ’ s surprise winner gilberto simoni of italy .
narrowing the lead at the end of the 191.5 kilometer race over six climbs , armstrong , who came in 11th with ullrich trailing right behind him , just barely managed to hold onto his first-place seating .
now only 18 seconds separate him from third-placed vinokourov .
the distance between ullrich and vinokourov is even more precarious : just three seconds .
ullrich was speechless after seeing his hopes for the yellow jersey once again slip out of his reach .
his team manager rudy pevenage told reporters he didn ’ t understand why ullrich held back on following vinokourov on the attack .
" he knows he ’ s supposed to keep tight on vinokourov , " a somewhat dismayed pevenage said .

the showdown in the pyrenees between lance armstrong and jan ullrich just got hotter after third-seated alexander vinokourov launched his attack in the 14th stage .
only 18 seconds separates the trio from one another . jan ullrich , lance armstrong and alexander vinokourov are battling it out for yellow in the pyrenees .
after a second day of head-to-head racing between ullrich , who gave the fight of his life on friday and saturday , and top-ranked armstrong , the race for the yellow jersey kicked up a notch in the 14th stage as vinokourov pushed ahead , taking 43 seconds off the leading duo .
vinokourov , third in the overall tour standing , produced one of his best rides on sunday .
eight kilometers short of the stage ’ s last hill at the peyresourde pass , he launched an all-out attack and crossed the finish line in loudenvielle sixth , 41 seconds behind the stage ’ s surprise winner gilberto simoni of italy .
narrowing the lead at the end of the 191.5 kilometer race over six climbs , armstrong , who came in 11th with ullrich trailing right behind him , just barely managed to hold onto his first-place seating .
now only 18 seconds separate him from third-placed vinokourov .
the distance between ullrich and vinokourov is even more precarious : just three seconds .

british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , left , is welcomed by japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi as he arrives at the mountain hot spring resort of hakone in japan saturday , july 19 , 2003 .
" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .
" there is an assumption running that actually the whole issue ... was just a strange invention of the cia or british intelligence , " he said in japan and then added , " it certainly was not .
i believe that intelligence to be genuine .

a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .

franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .
making matters worse , the spring started off with unusually cool , wet periods .

climactic warnings or normal ups and downs ?
but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .
in the alps , the record temperatures have caused glaciers , such as the one on the matterhorn , to start melting .
as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .
meteorologists in germany are not anticipating any long-term relief in the heat wave .

record draught causes damage germany has received only about half it ’ s normal yearly rainfall .
in many parts of the country the water level in rivers has reached its lowest level in a century .
on parts of the elbe and danube , ship traffic has come to a complete halt .
on the rhine , barges can only travel with reduced loads .
in the eastern half of the country and in parts of eastern europe , not a single drop of rain has fallen in weeks .
the ground is drying up and there ’ s a real danger of forest fires as vegetation becomes brittle .
franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .
making matters worse , the spring started off with unusually cool , wet periods .
" the whole year has really been a bad one .
we have regions , where there was at first a surplus of rain and now a drought , " feitner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matterhorn on july 15 , 2003 , where mountaineers are being evacuated after an avalanche .
geologists say the unusually warm weather is responsible for the rock slide since the permafrost is melting .
climactic warnings or normal ups and downs ?
but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .
in the alps , the record temperatures have caused glaciers , such as the one on the matterhorn , to start melting .
as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .
meteorologists in germany are not anticipating any long-term relief in the heat wave .
after a slight reprieve and a sprinkling of rain at the beginning of the week , temperatures are expected to rise again upwards of 30 degrees .
that means europe ’ s farmers will continue to wait for rain and everyone else will sweat it out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with a rising disaster dw-world looks at the social , economic and political effects of the century 's worst flood in germany -lrb- aug .

british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .

" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .
" there is an assumption running that actually the whole issue ... was just a strange invention of the cia or british intelligence , " he said in japan and then added , " it certainly was not .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.07.2003 blair refuses to resign over death of iraq expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front pages of london newspapers on saturday july 19 focus on government involvement in the death of david kelly .
british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , left , is welcomed by japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi as he arrives at the mountain hot spring resort of hakone in japan saturday , july 19 , 2003 .
" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .
" there is an assumption running that actually the whole issue ... was just a strange invention of the cia or british intelligence , " he said in japan and then added , " it certainly was not .
i believe that intelligence to be genuine .

a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a barge navigates around sandbanks in the rhine river near duisburg on july 16 , 2003 , after extreme heat and drought caused the water to dry up .
record draught causes damage germany has received only about half it ’ s normal yearly rainfall .
in many parts of the country the water level in rivers has reached its lowest level in a century .
on parts of the elbe and danube , ship traffic has come to a complete halt .
on the rhine , barges can only travel with reduced loads .
in the eastern half of the country and in parts of eastern europe , not a single drop of rain has fallen in weeks .
the ground is drying up and there ’ s a real danger of forest fires as vegetation becomes brittle .
franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .
making matters worse , the spring started off with unusually cool , wet periods .
" the whole year has really been a bad one .
we have regions , where there was at first a surplus of rain and now a drought , " feitner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matterhorn on july 15 , 2003 , where mountaineers are being evacuated after an avalanche .
geologists say the unusually warm weather is responsible for the rock slide since the permafrost is melting .
climactic warnings or normal ups and downs ?
but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .
in the alps , the record temperatures have caused glaciers , such as the one on the matterhorn , to start melting .
as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .

a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.07.2003 blair refuses to resign over death of iraq expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front pages of london newspapers on saturday july 19 focus on government involvement in the death of david kelly .
british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , left , is welcomed by japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi as he arrives at the mountain hot spring resort of hakone in japan saturday , july 19 , 2003 .
" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .
" there is an assumption running that actually the whole issue ... was just a strange invention of the cia or british intelligence , " he said in japan and then added , " it certainly was not .
i believe that intelligence to be genuine .

a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .

record draught causes damage germany has received only about half it ’ s normal yearly rainfall .
in many parts of the country the water level in rivers has reached its lowest level in a century .
on parts of the elbe and danube , ship traffic has come to a complete halt .
on the rhine , barges can only travel with reduced loads .
in the eastern half of the country and in parts of eastern europe , not a single drop of rain has fallen in weeks .
the ground is drying up and there ’ s a real danger of forest fires as vegetation becomes brittle .
franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .
making matters worse , the spring started off with unusually cool , wet periods .
" the whole year has really been a bad one .
we have regions , where there was at first a surplus of rain and now a drought , " feitner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matterhorn on july 15 , 2003 , where mountaineers are being evacuated after an avalanche .
geologists say the unusually warm weather is responsible for the rock slide since the permafrost is melting .
climactic warnings or normal ups and downs ?
but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .
in the alps , the record temperatures have caused glaciers , such as the one on the matterhorn , to start melting .
as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .
meteorologists in germany are not anticipating any long-term relief in the heat wave .
after a slight reprieve and a sprinkling of rain at the beginning of the week , temperatures are expected to rise again upwards of 30 degrees .
that means europe ’ s farmers will continue to wait for rain and everyone else will sweat it out . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dealing with a rising disaster dw-world looks at the social , economic and political effects of the century 's worst flood in germany -lrb- aug .

british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .

" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .
" there is an assumption running that actually the whole issue ... was just a strange invention of the cia or british intelligence , " he said in japan and then added , " it certainly was not .

the showdown in the pyrenees between lance armstrong and jan ullrich just got hotter after third-seated alexander vinokourov launched his attack in the 14th stage .
only 18 seconds separates the trio from one another . jan ullrich , lance armstrong and alexander vinokourov are battling it out for yellow in the pyrenees .
after a second day of head-to-head racing between ullrich , who gave the fight of his life on friday and saturday , and top-ranked armstrong , the race for the yellow jersey kicked up a notch in the 14th stage as vinokourov pushed ahead , taking 43 seconds off the leading duo .
vinokourov , third in the overall tour standing , produced one of his best rides on sunday .
eight kilometers short of the stage ’ s last hill at the peyresourde pass , he launched an all-out attack and crossed the finish line in loudenvielle sixth , 41 seconds behind the stage ’ s surprise winner gilberto simoni of italy .
narrowing the lead at the end of the 191.5 kilometer race over six climbs , armstrong , who came in 11th with ullrich trailing right behind him , just barely managed to hold onto his first-place seating .
now only 18 seconds separate him from third-placed vinokourov .
the distance between ullrich and vinokourov is even more precarious : just three seconds .
ullrich was speechless after seeing his hopes for the yellow jersey once again slip out of his reach .
his team manager rudy pevenage told reporters he didn ’ t understand why ullrich held back on following vinokourov on the attack .
" he knows he ’ s supposed to keep tight on vinokourov , " a somewhat dismayed pevenage said .
as for the kazakh , who rides for ullrich ’ s former team telekom , the chance of victory next sunday in paris seems one step closer .
" the possibility of riding in the yellow jersey , sent me soaring .

a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .

franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .

but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .

climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .

british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , left , is welcomed by japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi as he arrives at the mountain hot spring resort of hakone in japan saturday , july 19 , 2003 .
" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .
" there is an assumption running that actually the whole issue ... was just a strange invention of the cia or british intelligence , " he said in japan and then added , " it certainly was not .
i believe that intelligence to be genuine .

british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .

" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .

the showdown in the pyrenees between lance armstrong and jan ullrich just got hotter after third-seated alexander vinokourov launched his attack in the 14th stage .
only 18 seconds separates the trio from one another . jan ullrich , lance armstrong and alexander vinokourov are battling it out for yellow in the pyrenees .
after a second day of head-to-head racing between ullrich , who gave the fight of his life on friday and saturday , and top-ranked armstrong , the race for the yellow jersey kicked up a notch in the 14th stage as vinokourov pushed ahead , taking 43 seconds off the leading duo .
vinokourov , third in the overall tour standing , produced one of his best rides on sunday .
eight kilometers short of the stage ’ s last hill at the peyresourde pass , he launched an all-out attack and crossed the finish line in loudenvielle sixth , 41 seconds behind the stage ’ s surprise winner gilberto simoni of italy .
narrowing the lead at the end of the 191.5 kilometer race over six climbs , armstrong , who came in 11th with ullrich trailing right behind him , just barely managed to hold onto his first-place seating .
now only 18 seconds separate him from third-placed vinokourov .
the distance between ullrich and vinokourov is even more precarious : just three seconds .
ullrich was speechless after seeing his hopes for the yellow jersey once again slip out of his reach .
his team manager rudy pevenage told reporters he didn ’ t understand why ullrich held back on following vinokourov on the attack .
" he knows he ’ s supposed to keep tight on vinokourov , " a somewhat dismayed pevenage said .
as for the kazakh , who rides for ullrich ’ s former team telekom , the chance of victory next sunday in paris seems one step closer .

a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a barge navigates around sandbanks in the rhine river near duisburg on july 16 , 2003 , after extreme heat and drought caused the water to dry up .
record draught causes damage germany has received only about half it ’ s normal yearly rainfall .
in many parts of the country the water level in rivers has reached its lowest level in a century .
on parts of the elbe and danube , ship traffic has come to a complete halt .
on the rhine , barges can only travel with reduced loads .
in the eastern half of the country and in parts of eastern europe , not a single drop of rain has fallen in weeks .
the ground is drying up and there ’ s a real danger of forest fires as vegetation becomes brittle .
franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .
making matters worse , the spring started off with unusually cool , wet periods .
" the whole year has really been a bad one .
we have regions , where there was at first a surplus of rain and now a drought , " feitner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matterhorn on july 15 , 2003 , where mountaineers are being evacuated after an avalanche .
geologists say the unusually warm weather is responsible for the rock slide since the permafrost is melting .
climactic warnings or normal ups and downs ?
but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .
in the alps , the record temperatures have caused glaciers , such as the one on the matterhorn , to start melting .
as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .
meteorologists in germany are not anticipating any long-term relief in the heat wave .
after a slight reprieve and a sprinkling of rain at the beginning of the week , temperatures are expected to rise again upwards of 30 degrees .

a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .

in many parts of the country the water level in rivers has reached its lowest level in a century .

franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .

as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 20.07.2003 blair refuses to resign over death of iraq expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the front pages of london newspapers on saturday july 19 focus on government involvement in the death of david kelly .
british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british prime minister tony blair , left , is welcomed by japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi as he arrives at the mountain hot spring resort of hakone in japan saturday , july 19 , 2003 .
" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .
" there is an assumption running that actually the whole issue ... was just a strange invention of the cia or british intelligence , " he said in japan and then added , " it certainly was not .
i believe that intelligence to be genuine .

only 18 seconds separates the trio from one another . jan ullrich , lance armstrong and alexander vinokourov are battling it out for yellow in the pyrenees .
after a second day of head-to-head racing between ullrich , who gave the fight of his life on friday and saturday , and top-ranked armstrong , the race for the yellow jersey kicked up a notch in the 14th stage as vinokourov pushed ahead , taking 43 seconds off the leading duo .
vinokourov , third in the overall tour standing , produced one of his best rides on sunday .
eight kilometers short of the stage ’ s last hill at the peyresourde pass , he launched an all-out attack and crossed the finish line in loudenvielle sixth , 41 seconds behind the stage ’ s surprise winner gilberto simoni of italy .
narrowing the lead at the end of the 191.5 kilometer race over six climbs , armstrong , who came in 11th with ullrich trailing right behind him , just barely managed to hold onto his first-place seating .
now only 18 seconds separate him from third-placed vinokourov .
the distance between ullrich and vinokourov is even more precarious : just three seconds .
ullrich was speechless after seeing his hopes for the yellow jersey once again slip out of his reach .

the showdown in the pyrenees between lance armstrong and jan ullrich just got hotter after third-seated alexander vinokourov launched his attack in the 14th stage .
only 18 seconds separates the trio from one another . jan ullrich , lance armstrong and alexander vinokourov are battling it out for yellow in the pyrenees .
after a second day of head-to-head racing between ullrich , who gave the fight of his life on friday and saturday , and top-ranked armstrong , the race for the yellow jersey kicked up a notch in the 14th stage as vinokourov pushed ahead , taking 43 seconds off the leading duo .
vinokourov , third in the overall tour standing , produced one of his best rides on sunday .
eight kilometers short of the stage ’ s last hill at the peyresourde pass , he launched an all-out attack and crossed the finish line in loudenvielle sixth , 41 seconds behind the stage ’ s surprise winner gilberto simoni of italy .
narrowing the lead at the end of the 191.5 kilometer race over six climbs , armstrong , who came in 11th with ullrich trailing right behind him , just barely managed to hold onto his first-place seating .
now only 18 seconds separate him from third-placed vinokourov .
the distance between ullrich and vinokourov is even more precarious : just three seconds .
ullrich was speechless after seeing his hopes for the yellow jersey once again slip out of his reach .
his team manager rudy pevenage told reporters he didn ’ t understand why ullrich held back on following vinokourov on the attack .
" he knows he ’ s supposed to keep tight on vinokourov , " a somewhat dismayed pevenage said .
as for the kazakh , who rides for ullrich ’ s former team telekom , the chance of victory next sunday in paris seems one step closer .
" the possibility of riding in the yellow jersey , sent me soaring .

a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a barge navigates around sandbanks in the rhine river near duisburg on july 16 , 2003 , after extreme heat and drought caused the water to dry up .
record draught causes damage germany has received only about half it ’ s normal yearly rainfall .
in many parts of the country the water level in rivers has reached its lowest level in a century .
on parts of the elbe and danube , ship traffic has come to a complete halt .
on the rhine , barges can only travel with reduced loads .
in the eastern half of the country and in parts of eastern europe , not a single drop of rain has fallen in weeks .
the ground is drying up and there ’ s a real danger of forest fires as vegetation becomes brittle .
franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .
making matters worse , the spring started off with unusually cool , wet periods .
" the whole year has really been a bad one .
we have regions , where there was at first a surplus of rain and now a drought , " feitner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matterhorn on july 15 , 2003 , where mountaineers are being evacuated after an avalanche .
geologists say the unusually warm weather is responsible for the rock slide since the permafrost is melting .
climactic warnings or normal ups and downs ?
but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .
in the alps , the record temperatures have caused glaciers , such as the one on the matterhorn , to start melting .
as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .
meteorologists in germany are not anticipating any long-term relief in the heat wave .
after a slight reprieve and a sprinkling of rain at the beginning of the week , temperatures are expected to rise again upwards of 30 degrees .

a year ago large portions of europe were battling torrential rainfalls and record flooding .
this year they ’ re suffering from intense heat and an absence of rain .
experts say it could be a sign of more climate extremes . from the mediterranean to the north sea , europeans are complaining about the oven-like temperatures this summer .
with the mercury rising 15 to 20 degrees above the usual seasonal highs , life is no longer a pleasant sunshiny day .
in italy , for instance , six million households were temporarily out of electricity after numerous air conditioners and fans churning out cool breezes caused an overload on the power stations .
in southern france , residents have been told to limit consumption of water and electricity in order to avoid a shortage .
and farmers in eastern germany are saying they ’ ll harvest little more than dust this year .
because of the unusually low rainfall , they ’ re expecting up to 80 percent fewer crops .
climatologists are concerned about the unseasonable lack of rainfall .
" the record temperatures are not really a problem , " helmut malewski from the german wetterdienst told news service dpa .
" much more problematic is the drought , " the meteorologist added , pointing to the fact that water sources could start running dry .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a barge navigates around sandbanks in the rhine river near duisburg on july 16 , 2003 , after extreme heat and drought caused the water to dry up .
record draught causes damage germany has received only about half it ’ s normal yearly rainfall .
in many parts of the country the water level in rivers has reached its lowest level in a century .
on parts of the elbe and danube , ship traffic has come to a complete halt .
on the rhine , barges can only travel with reduced loads .
in the eastern half of the country and in parts of eastern europe , not a single drop of rain has fallen in weeks .
the ground is drying up and there ’ s a real danger of forest fires as vegetation becomes brittle .
franz josef feitner from the european agricultural association copa-cogeca told deutsche welle the drought has been particularly rough for farmers " in regions east of the line between hamburg and munich – including germany ’ s neighbors poland , hungary and slovakia . "
farmers with grain and cattle fodder have been especially hard hit this year .
in some eastern regions the heat and drought have continued non-stop since may .
making matters worse , the spring started off with unusually cool , wet periods .
" the whole year has really been a bad one .
we have regions , where there was at first a surplus of rain and now a drought , " feitner said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matterhorn on july 15 , 2003 , where mountaineers are being evacuated after an avalanche .
geologists say the unusually warm weather is responsible for the rock slide since the permafrost is melting .
climactic warnings or normal ups and downs ?
but the heat and dryness aren ’ t only a problem for agriculture ’ s ecological balance .
in the alps , the record temperatures have caused glaciers , such as the one on the matterhorn , to start melting .
as the layer of permafrost begins to recede , it exposes the barren rock face , which in turn becomes erosive and starts to break off .
in switzerland , avalanches on the mountain ’ s peak have wrecked havoc with flash floods further down in the valleys .
climatologists , however , aren ’ t unanimous in their interpretation of the season ’ s unusual heat and dryness .
not all of them see the conditions as catastrophic warnings of a global warming trend .
" it ’ s something that reoccurs every 15 to 20 years , " helmut malewski from germany ’ s wetterdienst said .
" it looks like we ’ re again in for another one of the so-called hottest summers of the century . "
but friedrich-wilhelm gerstengarbe , a climatologist at the potsdam center for climate change research thinks otherwise .
" we can expect more dry spells like the current one , more flooding , more mild winters – something we don ’ t usually have – and cold winters will be more severe .
we ’ ll see more of these extremes , " he said in an interview with deutsche welle .
a study by the potsdam institute projects weather trends up to the year 2055 .
looking at probable changes to the climate around berlin and brandenburg , it concludes that hours of sunshine will increase and temperatures will rise .
more heat and less rain for this summer at least , the warnings seem like they ’ ll hold true .
meteorologists in germany are not anticipating any long-term relief in the heat wave .
after a slight reprieve and a sprinkling of rain at the beginning of the week , temperatures are expected to rise again upwards of 30 degrees .

british prime minister tony blair has said he has no intention of stepping down after the death of a defense ministry expert widens the growing controversy over britain ’ s justification for invading iraq . pressure continues to mount on british prime minister tony blair after the apparent suicide of defense ministry weapons expert dr. david kelly shocked the nation this weekend and raised uncomfortable questions about the government ’ s responsibility .
the prime minister , who is currently touring east asia , has called for an end to speculation on the circumstances of kelly ’ s death until an independent inquiry is completed .
on saturday , police investigating the case said the biologist and former un weapons inspector had been found dead in the woods near his home of southmoore in oxfordshire with a slit wrist and a box of pain killers , most likely indicating suicide .
they say there ’ s no evidence that anybody else was involved in the death .
" many dark actors playing games " friends and family say the 59-year-old kelly , who was thought to be the anonymous source for a may 29 bbc news report claiming tony blair ’ s government had grossly exaggerated the threat of saddam hussein ’ s weapons arsenal to justify war , was under a great deal of pressure .
kelly ’ s widow confirmed her husband ’ s distress after being thrust into the spotlight .
in a statement read by a police spokesman she said , " events over recent weeks have made david ’ s life intolerable and all of those involved should reflect long and hard over that fact . "
the new york times reported on saturday that kelly had e-mailed a reporter shortly before his disappearance describing " many dark actors playing games . "
the paper 's reporter believed kelly meant officials with whom he had often disagreed over intelligence assessments on iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david kelly , british ministry of defense weapons expert is questioned by the foreign affairs select committee , july 15 .
earlier in the week , kelly had been called before a british parliamentary committee investigating his involvement in the televised report , which has cast a long shadow over downing street and its role in " sexing up " intelligence evidence in order to get the british public to rally behind a war on iraq .
kelly denied that he was the main source of the bbc ’ s information , but the bbc on sunday admitted kelly was in fact their primary informant .
bloody hands after recovering from the initial shock , tony blair said on sunday he had ordered an independent judicial inquiry into kelly ’ s death .
led by the respected judge lord hutton , the inquiry would have full governmental cooperation .
" i can assure you the judge will be able to get to all the facts , and all the people and all the papers that he wants , " blair said in an interview recorded with sky news in japan .

" what has happened is absolutely awful ...
i don ’ t think anybody in any quarter wanted or anticipated this happening , " blair explained and emphasized that the independent inquiry had to be allowed to carry out its full investigation before any conclusions were drawn .
" in the end the government is my responsibility , " the prime minister said when asked if he would accept blame if the investigation pointed to any wrongdoing by members of his government .
but at the same time blair emphatically dismissed demands for his resignation and rejected calls to ask members of parliament to return from their summer recess .
" i don ’ t really think we would gain anything by having parliamentarians coming back and debating something before they have actually got the judge ’ s report , " blair said while brushing aside calls from opposition conservative leader iain duncan smith that the prime minister cut short his asian trip and recall parliament to discuss the matter .
on saturday , blair dramatically refused to speak to reporters when asked at a press conference in japan , " have you got blood on your hands mr. prime minister ?
are you going to resign over this ? "
political crisis the failure to discover iraq ’ s weapons of mass destruction , the public dispute over the bbc report and now kelly ’ s death have plunged blair into the worst political crisis of his six-year administration .
even members from his own party are criticizing him and calling for him to step down .
glenda jackson , a former junior minister in the labor party , said blair " should bite the bullet and resign . "
it will be nearly impossible for the government to continue working effectively while the inquiry conducts it ’ s investigation , she said .
blair , for his part , is sticking to his government ’ s intelligence reports and the country ’ s involvement in the war on iraq .
" there is an assumption running that actually the whole issue ... was just a strange invention of the cia or british intelligence , " he said in japan and then added , " it certainly was not .

the request comes several days after mr annan appealed to the farc to free all its hostages .
a un spokesman said mr annan regarded the farc request for a meeting as a positive sign .

technical glitches with the student and exchange visitor information service mean students might miss a crucial 1 august registration deadline that was imposed in the wake of the 11 september 2001 attacks .
after learning that two of the hijackers had entered america on student visas , the us administration ordered the computerisation of all overseas applications for college places .
campus officers dealing with foreign students say they still are being hampered by problems with loading information into the system called sevis .
" the database is flawed .
it could n't have been done worse , " gail szenes - director of new york university 's office for international students and scholars - told associated press news agency .
foreigners omitted from the database will face strict scrutiny before their visas are renewed , and administrators fear some students will be denied visas unfairly simply because their names are not properly registered .
' damage done ' critics of sevis say it was introduced too quickly and , as a result , many foreign students are abandoning america for other countries .
michael brzezinski , director of the international students office at purdue university , told ap : " there has been some damage done .
i am aware of at least two government programs , in malaysia and saudi arabia , that are now sending their students to other countries . "
however chris bentley , spokesman for the us bureau of immigration and customs enforcement , said he expected sevis to improve the registration process .

military base the diego garcians were forced to leave their home in the 1970s when it was taken over by the british government for a british and american military base .

last october , aol time warner admitted that sales at aol had been overstated by about $ 170m in the two years to june 2002 .
