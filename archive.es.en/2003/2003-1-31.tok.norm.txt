the court 's seven judges , led by albrecht mentz , must determine in these final days of the trial whether motassadeq -lrb- illustration -rrb- , an electrical engineering student , should spend up to 15 years in prison for his alleged role as an accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people who died in the attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center and on the united airlines flight 93 jet that crashed in a pennsylvania field . families speak german law allows for survivors of crimes and relatives of murder victims to join the prosecution as co-plaintiffs in criminal cases .
fanning , stephen push , who leads the survivors advocacy group families of september 11 , and 19 other people who lost relatives in the attacks recently signed on to the case . “ to give the trial that personal testimony is essential , ” said andreas schulz , who is co-representing the majority of the co-plaintiffs in the trial .
“ this trial was very abstract .

but prosecutors are convinced he played a more integral role , taking care of the cell ’ s financial matters , handling bank accounts and paying some of their bills . fanning thinks the same .
she didn ’ t hesitate when push asked her three weeks ago whether she wanted to come and testify .
thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .

here are translated excerpts from the interview conducted by the public television station zdf .
zdf : a decision about iraq is about to be made .
will you maintain your position that germany will not vote for a war against iraq in the u.n. security council ?
schröder : the german position is unchanged .
by the way , i do n't think that a decision will be made immediately .
we are working on the issue of getting the inspectors the extra time they need .
that means that -lrb- a decision -rrb- naturally is not about to be made .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a zdf interview that he would turn over new evidence next wednesday .
could that change your mind ?
first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .
our american allies likely see that differently , mr. chancellor .
i think that i have made the german position clear .
i also know colin powell to be one of the most serious international discussion partners i have ever met , and i am rather certain that the americans will understand the position i have just described . ...
the americans know in particular that on similar matters , such as our participation in enduring freedom or our engagement in afghanistan , we have given no one reason to doubt our commitment to the fight against terrorism or to go so far as to question our commitment to fulfilling our obligations to the alliance -lrb- north atlantic treaty organization -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

11 attacks that claimed her husband jack 's life at the age of 54 . but she did n't want to miss the opportunity to let the 28-year-old moroccan - who german federal prosecutors believe provided logistical expertise to presumed sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta - know what sort of damage he and “ his friends ” had done . and she traveled 3,000 miles to hamburg to do it - at her own expense . “ the world has to be protected from the suicidal , murderous inclinations of the defendant and his friends , ” she told the judges at hamburg ’ s higher regional court on thursday , pausing as a translator delivered the message in german .
“ my heart was broken on 9/11 , but not my spirit .
until i take my last breath , i will not let this incredible loss of human life go in vain . ” mounir motassadeq looked on impassively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this courtroom drawing taken during the trial against mounir el motassadeq in hamburg , northern germany , on tuesday , oct .
22 , 2002 , shows in foreground the defendant mounir el motassadeq and in rear from left the defendant 's lawyers hartmut jacobi and hans leitstritz , the judges lutz von selle and albrecht mentz .
mounir el motassadeq is accused of aiding the hamburg terrorist cell involved in the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
-lrb- ap photo / zeichnung : juliane garstka -rrb- it was the same reaction he had for each of the five americans who testified thursday as representatives of 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
the court 's seven judges , led by albrecht mentz , must determine in these final days of the trial whether motassadeq -lrb- illustration -rrb- , an electrical engineering student , should spend up to 15 years in prison for his alleged role as an accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people who died in the attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center and on the united airlines flight 93 jet that crashed in a pennsylvania field . families speak german law allows for survivors of crimes and relatives of murder victims to join the prosecution as co-plaintiffs in criminal cases .
fanning , stephen push , who leads the survivors advocacy group families of september 11 , and 19 other people who lost relatives in the attacks recently signed on to the case . “ to give the trial that personal testimony is essential , ” said andreas schulz , who is co-representing the majority of the co-plaintiffs in the trial .
“ this trial was very abstract .
you see that nice young arab student and you can ’ t connect him to any mujahedeen warriors .
you can ’ t connect him to the 9/11 tragedy . ” defense attorneys for motassadeq , in jail since his arrest shortly after the attacks , maintain their client was merely friends with the hamburg-based al qaeda sleeper cell and had no knowledge of their plans .
but prosecutors are convinced he played a more integral role , taking care of the cell ’ s financial matters , handling bank accounts and paying some of their bills . fanning thinks the same .
she didn ’ t hesitate when push asked her three weeks ago whether she wanted to come and testify .
thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .
“ thanks for representing my dad , ” deangelis told fanning as she was about to board the plane .
on thursday in court , she wore a pin that deangelis had made to honor her dad . after all , fanning said , “ it ’ s not just about jack fanning , it ’ s about every single innocent victim , about every family that ’ s been destroyed .
it ’ s about the world at large . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but other leaders on the continent are still strongly opposed to a war in the region . european leaders were deeply divided on thursday over the possibility that the united states would launch a war against the regime of saddam hussein .
in an appeal that appeared in 12 continental newspapers , the leaders of eight european countries called on their citizens to support the united states in its effort to find any weapons of mass destruction held by iraq .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the article , which appeared on the newspaper 's opinion pages .
the call of support was signed by british prime minister tony blair , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , outgoing czech republic president vaclav havel and the leaders of portugal , denmark , hungary and poland .
the appeal was issued three days after u.n. weapons inspectors issued their first report on their work and said iraq had failed to cooperate adequately with teams seeking to assess its ability to produce and use weapons of mass destruction .
in thursday 's appeal , the european leaders said saddam was continuing his deceptive practices .
" we can not allow a dictator to systematically violate u.n. resolutions , " the appeal said .
critics respond to appeal the article generated an immediate reply from european critics of bush and his possible war plans .
in brussels , members of the european union 's parliament passed a resolution in which they warned the united states against carrying out an attack without authorization of the united nations .
the lawmakers , voting 287-209 , also acknowledged that the weapons inspectors had uncovered violations of u.n. resolutions , but that these violations did not justify a military operation .
members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .
the chancellor 's decision was based on germany 's obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization .
but a second parliamentary study conducted into the issue contradicted this position .
it said that an attack against iraq would not involve defense of the alliance and that a u.n. resolution that goes beyond previous decisions would be necessary .
after the reports were released , a u.s.spokeswoman told dw-world that american leaders expected no changes in the german position on use of the bases .

thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .
“ thanks for representing my dad , ” deangelis told fanning as she was about to board the plane .
on thursday in court , she wore a pin that deangelis had made to honor her dad . after all , fanning said , “ it ’ s not just about jack fanning , it ’ s about every single innocent victim , about every family that ’ s been destroyed .
it ’ s about the world at large . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

here are translated excerpts from the interview conducted by the public television station zdf .
zdf : a decision about iraq is about to be made .
will you maintain your position that germany will not vote for a war against iraq in the u.n. security council ?
schröder : the german position is unchanged .
by the way , i do n't think that a decision will be made immediately .
we are working on the issue of getting the inspectors the extra time they need .
that means that -lrb- a decision -rrb- naturally is not about to be made .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a zdf interview that he would turn over new evidence next wednesday .
could that change your mind ?
first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.01.2003 europeans leaders split on u.s. support in iraq debate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : on guard : german soldiers provide security at a u.s. facility near frankfurt the heads of eight european governments have expressed support for a u.s.-led military attack against iraq .
but other leaders on the continent are still strongly opposed to a war in the region . european leaders were deeply divided on thursday over the possibility that the united states would launch a war against the regime of saddam hussein .
in an appeal that appeared in 12 continental newspapers , the leaders of eight european countries called on their citizens to support the united states in its effort to find any weapons of mass destruction held by iraq .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the article , which appeared on the newspaper 's opinion pages .
the call of support was signed by british prime minister tony blair , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , outgoing czech republic president vaclav havel and the leaders of portugal , denmark , hungary and poland .
the appeal was issued three days after u.n. weapons inspectors issued their first report on their work and said iraq had failed to cooperate adequately with teams seeking to assess its ability to produce and use weapons of mass destruction .
in thursday 's appeal , the european leaders said saddam was continuing his deceptive practices .
" we can not allow a dictator to systematically violate u.n. resolutions , " the appeal said .
critics respond to appeal the article generated an immediate reply from european critics of bush and his possible war plans .
in brussels , members of the european union 's parliament passed a resolution in which they warned the united states against carrying out an attack without authorization of the united nations .
the lawmakers , voting 287-209 , also acknowledged that the weapons inspectors had uncovered violations of u.n. resolutions , but that these violations did not justify a military operation .
members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .
the chancellor 's decision was based on germany 's obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization .
but a second parliamentary study conducted into the issue contradicted this position .
it said that an attack against iraq would not involve defense of the alliance and that a u.n. resolution that goes beyond previous decisions would be necessary .
after the reports were released , a u.s.spokeswoman told dw-world that american leaders expected no changes in the german position on use of the bases .
" we are relying on the german government to keep its word , " the spokesman for the u.s. embassy in berlin said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder remains opposed to war on iraq 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but other leaders on the continent are still strongly opposed to a war in the region . european leaders were deeply divided on thursday over the possibility that the united states would launch a war against the regime of saddam hussein .
in an appeal that appeared in 12 continental newspapers , the leaders of eight european countries called on their citizens to support the united states in its effort to find any weapons of mass destruction held by iraq .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the article , which appeared on the newspaper 's opinion pages .
the call of support was signed by british prime minister tony blair , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , outgoing czech republic president vaclav havel and the leaders of portugal , denmark , hungary and poland .
the appeal was issued three days after u.n. weapons inspectors issued their first report on their work and said iraq had failed to cooperate adequately with teams seeking to assess its ability to produce and use weapons of mass destruction .
in thursday 's appeal , the european leaders said saddam was continuing his deceptive practices .
" we can not allow a dictator to systematically violate u.n. resolutions , " the appeal said .
critics respond to appeal the article generated an immediate reply from european critics of bush and his possible war plans .
in brussels , members of the european union 's parliament passed a resolution in which they warned the united states against carrying out an attack without authorization of the united nations .
the lawmakers , voting 287-209 , also acknowledged that the weapons inspectors had uncovered violations of u.n. resolutions , but that these violations did not justify a military operation .
members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .
the chancellor 's decision was based on germany 's obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization .
but a second parliamentary study conducted into the issue contradicted this position .
it said that an attack against iraq would not involve defense of the alliance and that a u.n. resolution that goes beyond previous decisions would be necessary .
after the reports were released , a u.s.spokeswoman told dw-world that american leaders expected no changes in the german position on use of the bases .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.01.2003 schröder pledges not to change iraq stance großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : happier times : u.s. president bush and german chancellor schröder last may german chancellor gerhard schröder defends his views on a potential military conflict with iraq and asks the united states to recogize his previous support for it . under increasing pressure from the united states , german chancellor gerhard schröder defended his opposition to a possible war on iraq during a wednesday night interview .
here are translated excerpts from the interview conducted by the public television station zdf .
zdf : a decision about iraq is about to be made .
will you maintain your position that germany will not vote for a war against iraq in the u.n. security council ?
schröder : the german position is unchanged .
by the way , i do n't think that a decision will be made immediately .
we are working on the issue of getting the inspectors the extra time they need .
that means that -lrb- a decision -rrb- naturally is not about to be made .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a zdf interview that he would turn over new evidence next wednesday .
could that change your mind ?
first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .
our american allies likely see that differently , mr. chancellor .
i think that i have made the german position clear .
i also know colin powell to be one of the most serious international discussion partners i have ever met , and i am rather certain that the americans will understand the position i have just described . ...
the americans know in particular that on similar matters , such as our participation in enduring freedom or our engagement in afghanistan , we have given no one reason to doubt our commitment to the fight against terrorism or to go so far as to question our commitment to fulfilling our obligations to the alliance -lrb- north atlantic treaty organization -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

“ my heart was broken on 9/11 , but not my spirit .
until i take my last breath , i will not let this incredible loss of human life go in vain . ” mounir motassadeq looked on impassively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this courtroom drawing taken during the trial against mounir el motassadeq in hamburg , northern germany , on tuesday , oct .
22 , 2002 , shows in foreground the defendant mounir el motassadeq and in rear from left the defendant 's lawyers hartmut jacobi and hans leitstritz , the judges lutz von selle and albrecht mentz .
mounir el motassadeq is accused of aiding the hamburg terrorist cell involved in the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
-lrb- ap photo / zeichnung : juliane garstka -rrb- it was the same reaction he had for each of the five americans who testified thursday as representatives of 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
the court 's seven judges , led by albrecht mentz , must determine in these final days of the trial whether motassadeq -lrb- illustration -rrb- , an electrical engineering student , should spend up to 15 years in prison for his alleged role as an accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people who died in the attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center and on the united airlines flight 93 jet that crashed in a pennsylvania field . families speak german law allows for survivors of crimes and relatives of murder victims to join the prosecution as co-plaintiffs in criminal cases .
fanning , stephen push , who leads the survivors advocacy group families of september 11 , and 19 other people who lost relatives in the attacks recently signed on to the case . “ to give the trial that personal testimony is essential , ” said andreas schulz , who is co-representing the majority of the co-plaintiffs in the trial .
“ this trial was very abstract .
you see that nice young arab student and you can ’ t connect him to any mujahedeen warriors .
you can ’ t connect him to the 9/11 tragedy . ” defense attorneys for motassadeq , in jail since his arrest shortly after the attacks , maintain their client was merely friends with the hamburg-based al qaeda sleeper cell and had no knowledge of their plans .
but prosecutors are convinced he played a more integral role , taking care of the cell ’ s financial matters , handling bank accounts and paying some of their bills . fanning thinks the same .
she didn ’ t hesitate when push asked her three weeks ago whether she wanted to come and testify .
thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .
“ thanks for representing my dad , ” deangelis told fanning as she was about to board the plane .
on thursday in court , she wore a pin that deangelis had made to honor her dad . after all , fanning said , “ it ’ s not just about jack fanning , it ’ s about every single innocent victim , about every family that ’ s been destroyed .
it ’ s about the world at large . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

here are translated excerpts from the interview conducted by the public television station zdf .
zdf : a decision about iraq is about to be made .
will you maintain your position that germany will not vote for a war against iraq in the u.n. security council ?
schröder : the german position is unchanged .
by the way , i do n't think that a decision will be made immediately .
we are working on the issue of getting the inspectors the extra time they need .
that means that -lrb- a decision -rrb- naturally is not about to be made .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a zdf interview that he would turn over new evidence next wednesday .
could that change your mind ?
first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .
our american allies likely see that differently , mr. chancellor .
i think that i have made the german position clear .
i also know colin powell to be one of the most serious international discussion partners i have ever met , and i am rather certain that the americans will understand the position i have just described . ...
the americans know in particular that on similar matters , such as our participation in enduring freedom or our engagement in afghanistan , we have given no one reason to doubt our commitment to the fight against terrorism or to go so far as to question our commitment to fulfilling our obligations to the alliance -lrb- north atlantic treaty organization -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

here are translated excerpts from the interview conducted by the public television station zdf .
zdf : a decision about iraq is about to be made .
will you maintain your position that germany will not vote for a war against iraq in the u.n. security council ?
schröder : the german position is unchanged .
by the way , i do n't think that a decision will be made immediately .
we are working on the issue of getting the inspectors the extra time they need .
that means that -lrb- a decision -rrb- naturally is not about to be made .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a zdf interview that he would turn over new evidence next wednesday .
could that change your mind ?
first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .
our american allies likely see that differently , mr. chancellor .
i think that i have made the german position clear .
i also know colin powell to be one of the most serious international discussion partners i have ever met , and i am rather certain that the americans will understand the position i have just described . ...
the americans know in particular that on similar matters , such as our participation in enduring freedom or our engagement in afghanistan , we have given no one reason to doubt our commitment to the fight against terrorism or to go so far as to question our commitment to fulfilling our obligations to the alliance -lrb- north atlantic treaty organization -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but other leaders on the continent are still strongly opposed to a war in the region . european leaders were deeply divided on thursday over the possibility that the united states would launch a war against the regime of saddam hussein .
in an appeal that appeared in 12 continental newspapers , the leaders of eight european countries called on their citizens to support the united states in its effort to find any weapons of mass destruction held by iraq .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the article , which appeared on the newspaper 's opinion pages .
the call of support was signed by british prime minister tony blair , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , outgoing czech republic president vaclav havel and the leaders of portugal , denmark , hungary and poland .
the appeal was issued three days after u.n. weapons inspectors issued their first report on their work and said iraq had failed to cooperate adequately with teams seeking to assess its ability to produce and use weapons of mass destruction .
in thursday 's appeal , the european leaders said saddam was continuing his deceptive practices .
" we can not allow a dictator to systematically violate u.n. resolutions , " the appeal said .
critics respond to appeal the article generated an immediate reply from european critics of bush and his possible war plans .
in brussels , members of the european union 's parliament passed a resolution in which they warned the united states against carrying out an attack without authorization of the united nations .
the lawmakers , voting 287-209 , also acknowledged that the weapons inspectors had uncovered violations of u.n. resolutions , but that these violations did not justify a military operation .
members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .
the chancellor 's decision was based on germany 's obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization .
but a second parliamentary study conducted into the issue contradicted this position .
it said that an attack against iraq would not involve defense of the alliance and that a u.n. resolution that goes beyond previous decisions would be necessary .
after the reports were released , a u.s.spokeswoman told dw-world that american leaders expected no changes in the german position on use of the bases .

the appeal was issued three days after u.n. weapons inspectors issued their first report on their work and said iraq had failed to cooperate adequately with teams seeking to assess its ability to produce and use weapons of mass destruction .
in thursday 's appeal , the european leaders said saddam was continuing his deceptive practices .
" we can not allow a dictator to systematically violate u.n. resolutions , " the appeal said .
critics respond to appeal the article generated an immediate reply from european critics of bush and his possible war plans .
in brussels , members of the european union 's parliament passed a resolution in which they warned the united states against carrying out an attack without authorization of the united nations .
the lawmakers , voting 287-209 , also acknowledged that the weapons inspectors had uncovered violations of u.n. resolutions , but that these violations did not justify a military operation .
members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .
the chancellor 's decision was based on germany 's obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization .
but a second parliamentary study conducted into the issue contradicted this position .
it said that an attack against iraq would not involve defense of the alliance and that a u.n. resolution that goes beyond previous decisions would be necessary .
after the reports were released , a u.s.spokeswoman told dw-world that american leaders expected no changes in the german position on use of the bases .

but other leaders on the continent are still strongly opposed to a war in the region . european leaders were deeply divided on thursday over the possibility that the united states would launch a war against the regime of saddam hussein .
in an appeal that appeared in 12 continental newspapers , the leaders of eight european countries called on their citizens to support the united states in its effort to find any weapons of mass destruction held by iraq .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the article , which appeared on the newspaper 's opinion pages .
the call of support was signed by british prime minister tony blair , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , outgoing czech republic president vaclav havel and the leaders of portugal , denmark , hungary and poland .
the appeal was issued three days after u.n. weapons inspectors issued their first report on their work and said iraq had failed to cooperate adequately with teams seeking to assess its ability to produce and use weapons of mass destruction .
in thursday 's appeal , the european leaders said saddam was continuing his deceptive practices .
" we can not allow a dictator to systematically violate u.n. resolutions , " the appeal said .
critics respond to appeal the article generated an immediate reply from european critics of bush and his possible war plans .
in brussels , members of the european union 's parliament passed a resolution in which they warned the united states against carrying out an attack without authorization of the united nations .
the lawmakers , voting 287-209 , also acknowledged that the weapons inspectors had uncovered violations of u.n. resolutions , but that these violations did not justify a military operation .
members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .
the chancellor 's decision was based on germany 's obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization .
but a second parliamentary study conducted into the issue contradicted this position .
it said that an attack against iraq would not involve defense of the alliance and that a u.n. resolution that goes beyond previous decisions would be necessary .
after the reports were released , a u.s.spokeswoman told dw-world that american leaders expected no changes in the german position on use of the bases .

here are translated excerpts from the interview conducted by the public television station zdf .
zdf : a decision about iraq is about to be made .
will you maintain your position that germany will not vote for a war against iraq in the u.n. security council ?
schröder : the german position is unchanged .
by the way , i do n't think that a decision will be made immediately .
we are working on the issue of getting the inspectors the extra time they need .
that means that -lrb- a decision -rrb- naturally is not about to be made .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a zdf interview that he would turn over new evidence next wednesday .
could that change your mind ?
first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .
our american allies likely see that differently , mr. chancellor .
i think that i have made the german position clear .
i also know colin powell to be one of the most serious international discussion partners i have ever met , and i am rather certain that the americans will understand the position i have just described . ...
the americans know in particular that on similar matters , such as our participation in enduring freedom or our engagement in afghanistan , we have given no one reason to doubt our commitment to the fight against terrorism or to go so far as to question our commitment to fulfilling our obligations to the alliance -lrb- north atlantic treaty organization -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .
our american allies likely see that differently , mr. chancellor .
i think that i have made the german position clear .
i also know colin powell to be one of the most serious international discussion partners i have ever met , and i am rather certain that the americans will understand the position i have just described . ...
the americans know in particular that on similar matters , such as our participation in enduring freedom or our engagement in afghanistan , we have given no one reason to doubt our commitment to the fight against terrorism or to go so far as to question our commitment to fulfilling our obligations to the alliance -lrb- north atlantic treaty organization -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

11 attacks on the united states .
-lrb- ap photo / zeichnung : juliane garstka -rrb- it was the same reaction he had for each of the five americans who testified thursday as representatives of 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
the court 's seven judges , led by albrecht mentz , must determine in these final days of the trial whether motassadeq -lrb- illustration -rrb- , an electrical engineering student , should spend up to 15 years in prison for his alleged role as an accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people who died in the attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center and on the united airlines flight 93 jet that crashed in a pennsylvania field . families speak german law allows for survivors of crimes and relatives of murder victims to join the prosecution as co-plaintiffs in criminal cases .
fanning , stephen push , who leads the survivors advocacy group families of september 11 , and 19 other people who lost relatives in the attacks recently signed on to the case . “ to give the trial that personal testimony is essential , ” said andreas schulz , who is co-representing the majority of the co-plaintiffs in the trial .
“ this trial was very abstract .
you see that nice young arab student and you can ’ t connect him to any mujahedeen warriors .
you can ’ t connect him to the 9/11 tragedy . ” defense attorneys for motassadeq , in jail since his arrest shortly after the attacks , maintain their client was merely friends with the hamburg-based al qaeda sleeper cell and had no knowledge of their plans .
but prosecutors are convinced he played a more integral role , taking care of the cell ’ s financial matters , handling bank accounts and paying some of their bills . fanning thinks the same .
she didn ’ t hesitate when push asked her three weeks ago whether she wanted to come and testify .
thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .
“ thanks for representing my dad , ” deangelis told fanning as she was about to board the plane .
on thursday in court , she wore a pin that deangelis had made to honor her dad . after all , fanning said , “ it ’ s not just about jack fanning , it ’ s about every single innocent victim , about every family that ’ s been destroyed .

thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .
“ thanks for representing my dad , ” deangelis told fanning as she was about to board the plane .
on thursday in court , she wore a pin that deangelis had made to honor her dad . after all , fanning said , “ it ’ s not just about jack fanning , it ’ s about every single innocent victim , about every family that ’ s been destroyed .
it ’ s about the world at large . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but other leaders on the continent are still strongly opposed to a war in the region . european leaders were deeply divided on thursday over the possibility that the united states would launch a war against the regime of saddam hussein .
in an appeal that appeared in 12 continental newspapers , the leaders of eight european countries called on their citizens to support the united states in its effort to find any weapons of mass destruction held by iraq .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the article , which appeared on the newspaper 's opinion pages .
the call of support was signed by british prime minister tony blair , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , outgoing czech republic president vaclav havel and the leaders of portugal , denmark , hungary and poland .
the appeal was issued three days after u.n. weapons inspectors issued their first report on their work and said iraq had failed to cooperate adequately with teams seeking to assess its ability to produce and use weapons of mass destruction .
in thursday 's appeal , the european leaders said saddam was continuing his deceptive practices .
" we can not allow a dictator to systematically violate u.n. resolutions , " the appeal said .
critics respond to appeal the article generated an immediate reply from european critics of bush and his possible war plans .
in brussels , members of the european union 's parliament passed a resolution in which they warned the united states against carrying out an attack without authorization of the united nations .
the lawmakers , voting 287-209 , also acknowledged that the weapons inspectors had uncovered violations of u.n. resolutions , but that these violations did not justify a military operation .
members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .
the chancellor 's decision was based on germany 's obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization .
but a second parliamentary study conducted into the issue contradicted this position .
it said that an attack against iraq would not involve defense of the alliance and that a u.n. resolution that goes beyond previous decisions would be necessary .
after the reports were released , a u.s.spokeswoman told dw-world that american leaders expected no changes in the german position on use of the bases .
" we are relying on the german government to keep its word , " the spokesman for the u.s. embassy in berlin said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder remains opposed to war on iraq radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but other leaders on the continent are still strongly opposed to a war in the region . european leaders were deeply divided on thursday over the possibility that the united states would launch a war against the regime of saddam hussein .
in an appeal that appeared in 12 continental newspapers , the leaders of eight european countries called on their citizens to support the united states in its effort to find any weapons of mass destruction held by iraq .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the article , which appeared on the newspaper 's opinion pages .
the call of support was signed by british prime minister tony blair , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , outgoing czech republic president vaclav havel and the leaders of portugal , denmark , hungary and poland .
the appeal was issued three days after u.n. weapons inspectors issued their first report on their work and said iraq had failed to cooperate adequately with teams seeking to assess its ability to produce and use weapons of mass destruction .
in thursday 's appeal , the european leaders said saddam was continuing his deceptive practices .
" we can not allow a dictator to systematically violate u.n. resolutions , " the appeal said .
critics respond to appeal the article generated an immediate reply from european critics of bush and his possible war plans .
in brussels , members of the european union 's parliament passed a resolution in which they warned the united states against carrying out an attack without authorization of the united nations .
the lawmakers , voting 287-209 , also acknowledged that the weapons inspectors had uncovered violations of u.n. resolutions , but that these violations did not justify a military operation .
members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .
the chancellor 's decision was based on germany 's obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization .
but a second parliamentary study conducted into the issue contradicted this position .
it said that an attack against iraq would not involve defense of the alliance and that a u.n. resolution that goes beyond previous decisions would be necessary .
after the reports were released , a u.s.spokeswoman told dw-world that american leaders expected no changes in the german position on use of the bases .

members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .
the chancellor 's decision was based on germany 's obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization .
but a second parliamentary study conducted into the issue contradicted this position .
it said that an attack against iraq would not involve defense of the alliance and that a u.n. resolution that goes beyond previous decisions would be necessary .
after the reports were released , a u.s.spokeswoman told dw-world that american leaders expected no changes in the german position on use of the bases .
" we are relying on the german government to keep its word , " the spokesman for the u.s. embassy in berlin said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder remains opposed to war on iraq radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in exchange , the nine companies removed their complaint from düsseldorf ’ s higher regional court . “ this deal allows us to kickstart the expansion of our gas business , enabling us to compete effectively against other major european gas companies , ” said e.on ceo ulrich hartmann .
“ against this background , the commitments we have made to the opponents are reasonably bearable . ” düsseldorf-based e.on is the world ’ s second-largest electric company , following only france ’ s state-run edf in size .
based on energy revenues , e.on ’ s takeover of ruhrgas , germany ’ s leading natural gas provider , will make it the world ’ s largest energy company . as part of the deal , e.on has agreed to pay six of the nine plaintiffs in the case € 90 million -lrb- $ 96.65 million -rrb- .
but the company said the non-cash settlement will be paid for through a barter system – including gas and electricity supplies , giving away some of its facilities and interests , marketing subsidies as well as some cash benefits .
the agreement followed days of negotiations between e.on and its competitors over ways to compensate for what would amount to competitive disadvantages for the companies . e.on said it would take over the remaining shares of ruhrgas from the company rag by the end of the day friday , thus taking over the controlling interest in the natural gas giant .
e.on has also said it would seek to purchase shares of ruhrgas owned by shell , exxonmobil and other companies . hard-fought battle draws to a close e.on fought for more than two years to take control of ruhrgas , and friday ’ s surprise agreement came only one hour before the düsseldorf court had been scheduled to issue its own ruling over whether or not the federal ministerial approval for the merger was valid .
the court had previously issued a temporary injunction banning the ruhrgas takeover , and observers say the court would likely have ruled against the merger despite the fact that germany ’ s economics ministry twice approved the deal . the deal also comes as a surprise for the essen-based mining company rag .
the company will now swap its ruhrgas shares with e.on for control of the world ’ s biggest specialty chemical-maker , degussa . on friday , the federation of german consumer organizations criticized the deal , calling it a “ setback for fair competition and for consumers . ”
the consumer lobby said the deal could lead to the creation of an overly powerful juggernaut that could damage competition .
and in the end , it said , consumers would be the ones who paid . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

11 attacks that claimed her husband jack 's life at the age of 54 . but she did n't want to miss the opportunity to let the 28-year-old moroccan - who german federal prosecutors believe provided logistical expertise to presumed sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta - know what sort of damage he and “ his friends ” had done . and she traveled 3,000 miles to hamburg to do it - at her own expense . “ the world has to be protected from the suicidal , murderous inclinations of the defendant and his friends , ” she told the judges at hamburg ’ s higher regional court on thursday , pausing as a translator delivered the message in german .
“ my heart was broken on 9/11 , but not my spirit .
until i take my last breath , i will not let this incredible loss of human life go in vain . ” mounir motassadeq looked on impassively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this courtroom drawing taken during the trial against mounir el motassadeq in hamburg , northern germany , on tuesday , oct .
22 , 2002 , shows in foreground the defendant mounir el motassadeq and in rear from left the defendant 's lawyers hartmut jacobi and hans leitstritz , the judges lutz von selle and albrecht mentz .
mounir el motassadeq is accused of aiding the hamburg terrorist cell involved in the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
-lrb- ap photo / zeichnung : juliane garstka -rrb- it was the same reaction he had for each of the five americans who testified thursday as representatives of 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
the court 's seven judges , led by albrecht mentz , must determine in these final days of the trial whether motassadeq -lrb- illustration -rrb- , an electrical engineering student , should spend up to 15 years in prison for his alleged role as an accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people who died in the attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center and on the united airlines flight 93 jet that crashed in a pennsylvania field . families speak german law allows for survivors of crimes and relatives of murder victims to join the prosecution as co-plaintiffs in criminal cases .
fanning , stephen push , who leads the survivors advocacy group families of september 11 , and 19 other people who lost relatives in the attacks recently signed on to the case . “ to give the trial that personal testimony is essential , ” said andreas schulz , who is co-representing the majority of the co-plaintiffs in the trial .
“ this trial was very abstract .
you see that nice young arab student and you can ’ t connect him to any mujahedeen warriors .
you can ’ t connect him to the 9/11 tragedy . ” defense attorneys for motassadeq , in jail since his arrest shortly after the attacks , maintain their client was merely friends with the hamburg-based al qaeda sleeper cell and had no knowledge of their plans .
but prosecutors are convinced he played a more integral role , taking care of the cell ’ s financial matters , handling bank accounts and paying some of their bills . fanning thinks the same .
she didn ’ t hesitate when push asked her three weeks ago whether she wanted to come and testify .
thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .
“ thanks for representing my dad , ” deangelis told fanning as she was about to board the plane .
on thursday in court , she wore a pin that deangelis had made to honor her dad . after all , fanning said , “ it ’ s not just about jack fanning , it ’ s about every single innocent victim , about every family that ’ s been destroyed .
it ’ s about the world at large . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

here are translated excerpts from the interview conducted by the public television station zdf .
zdf : a decision about iraq is about to be made .
will you maintain your position that germany will not vote for a war against iraq in the u.n. security council ?
schröder : the german position is unchanged .
by the way , i do n't think that a decision will be made immediately .
we are working on the issue of getting the inspectors the extra time they need .
that means that -lrb- a decision -rrb- naturally is not about to be made .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a zdf interview that he would turn over new evidence next wednesday .
could that change your mind ?
first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .
our american allies likely see that differently , mr. chancellor .
i think that i have made the german position clear .
i also know colin powell to be one of the most serious international discussion partners i have ever met , and i am rather certain that the americans will understand the position i have just described . ...
the americans know in particular that on similar matters , such as our participation in enduring freedom or our engagement in afghanistan , we have given no one reason to doubt our commitment to the fight against terrorism or to go so far as to question our commitment to fulfilling our obligations to the alliance -lrb- north atlantic treaty organization -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

in exchange , the nine companies removed their complaint from düsseldorf ’ s higher regional court . “ this deal allows us to kickstart the expansion of our gas business , enabling us to compete effectively against other major european gas companies , ” said e.on ceo ulrich hartmann .
“ against this background , the commitments we have made to the opponents are reasonably bearable . ” düsseldorf-based e.on is the world ’ s second-largest electric company , following only france ’ s state-run edf in size .
based on energy revenues , e.on ’ s takeover of ruhrgas , germany ’ s leading natural gas provider , will make it the world ’ s largest energy company . as part of the deal , e.on has agreed to pay six of the nine plaintiffs in the case € 90 million -lrb- $ 96.65 million -rrb- .
but the company said the non-cash settlement will be paid for through a barter system – including gas and electricity supplies , giving away some of its facilities and interests , marketing subsidies as well as some cash benefits .
the agreement followed days of negotiations between e.on and its competitors over ways to compensate for what would amount to competitive disadvantages for the companies . e.on said it would take over the remaining shares of ruhrgas from the company rag by the end of the day friday , thus taking over the controlling interest in the natural gas giant .
e.on has also said it would seek to purchase shares of ruhrgas owned by shell , exxonmobil and other companies . hard-fought battle draws to a close e.on fought for more than two years to take control of ruhrgas , and friday ’ s surprise agreement came only one hour before the düsseldorf court had been scheduled to issue its own ruling over whether or not the federal ministerial approval for the merger was valid .
the court had previously issued a temporary injunction banning the ruhrgas takeover , and observers say the court would likely have ruled against the merger despite the fact that germany ’ s economics ministry twice approved the deal . the deal also comes as a surprise for the essen-based mining company rag .
the company will now swap its ruhrgas shares with e.on for control of the world ’ s biggest specialty chemical-maker , degussa . on friday , the federation of german consumer organizations criticized the deal , calling it a “ setback for fair competition and for consumers . ”

but other leaders on the continent are still strongly opposed to a war in the region . european leaders were deeply divided on thursday over the possibility that the united states would launch a war against the regime of saddam hussein .
in an appeal that appeared in 12 continental newspapers , the leaders of eight european countries called on their citizens to support the united states in its effort to find any weapons of mass destruction held by iraq .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the article , which appeared on the newspaper 's opinion pages .
the call of support was signed by british prime minister tony blair , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , outgoing czech republic president vaclav havel and the leaders of portugal , denmark , hungary and poland .
the appeal was issued three days after u.n. weapons inspectors issued their first report on their work and said iraq had failed to cooperate adequately with teams seeking to assess its ability to produce and use weapons of mass destruction .
in thursday 's appeal , the european leaders said saddam was continuing his deceptive practices .
" we can not allow a dictator to systematically violate u.n. resolutions , " the appeal said .
critics respond to appeal the article generated an immediate reply from european critics of bush and his possible war plans .
in brussels , members of the european union 's parliament passed a resolution in which they warned the united states against carrying out an attack without authorization of the united nations .
the lawmakers , voting 287-209 , also acknowledged that the weapons inspectors had uncovered violations of u.n. resolutions , but that these violations did not justify a military operation .
members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .
the chancellor 's decision was based on germany 's obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization .
but a second parliamentary study conducted into the issue contradicted this position .
it said that an attack against iraq would not involve defense of the alliance and that a u.n. resolution that goes beyond previous decisions would be necessary .
after the reports were released , a u.s.spokeswoman told dw-world that american leaders expected no changes in the german position on use of the bases .

but other leaders on the continent are still strongly opposed to a war in the region . european leaders were deeply divided on thursday over the possibility that the united states would launch a war against the regime of saddam hussein .
in an appeal that appeared in 12 continental newspapers , the leaders of eight european countries called on their citizens to support the united states in its effort to find any weapons of mass destruction held by iraq .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the article , which appeared on the newspaper 's opinion pages .
the call of support was signed by british prime minister tony blair , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , outgoing czech republic president vaclav havel and the leaders of portugal , denmark , hungary and poland .
the appeal was issued three days after u.n. weapons inspectors issued their first report on their work and said iraq had failed to cooperate adequately with teams seeking to assess its ability to produce and use weapons of mass destruction .
in thursday 's appeal , the european leaders said saddam was continuing his deceptive practices .
" we can not allow a dictator to systematically violate u.n. resolutions , " the appeal said .
critics respond to appeal the article generated an immediate reply from european critics of bush and his possible war plans .
in brussels , members of the european union 's parliament passed a resolution in which they warned the united states against carrying out an attack without authorization of the united nations .
the lawmakers , voting 287-209 , also acknowledged that the weapons inspectors had uncovered violations of u.n. resolutions , but that these violations did not justify a military operation .
members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .
the chancellor 's decision was based on germany 's obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization .
but a second parliamentary study conducted into the issue contradicted this position .
it said that an attack against iraq would not involve defense of the alliance and that a u.n. resolution that goes beyond previous decisions would be necessary .
after the reports were released , a u.s.spokeswoman told dw-world that american leaders expected no changes in the german position on use of the bases .
" we are relying on the german government to keep its word , " the spokesman for the u.s. embassy in berlin said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder remains opposed to war on iraq 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

11 attacks that claimed her husband jack 's life at the age of 54 . but she did n't want to miss the opportunity to let the 28-year-old moroccan - who german federal prosecutors believe provided logistical expertise to presumed sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta - know what sort of damage he and “ his friends ” had done . and she traveled 3,000 miles to hamburg to do it - at her own expense . “ the world has to be protected from the suicidal , murderous inclinations of the defendant and his friends , ” she told the judges at hamburg ’ s higher regional court on thursday , pausing as a translator delivered the message in german .
“ my heart was broken on 9/11 , but not my spirit .
until i take my last breath , i will not let this incredible loss of human life go in vain . ” mounir motassadeq looked on impassively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this courtroom drawing taken during the trial against mounir el motassadeq in hamburg , northern germany , on tuesday , oct .
22 , 2002 , shows in foreground the defendant mounir el motassadeq and in rear from left the defendant 's lawyers hartmut jacobi and hans leitstritz , the judges lutz von selle and albrecht mentz .
mounir el motassadeq is accused of aiding the hamburg terrorist cell involved in the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
-lrb- ap photo / zeichnung : juliane garstka -rrb- it was the same reaction he had for each of the five americans who testified thursday as representatives of 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
the court 's seven judges , led by albrecht mentz , must determine in these final days of the trial whether motassadeq -lrb- illustration -rrb- , an electrical engineering student , should spend up to 15 years in prison for his alleged role as an accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people who died in the attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center and on the united airlines flight 93 jet that crashed in a pennsylvania field . families speak german law allows for survivors of crimes and relatives of murder victims to join the prosecution as co-plaintiffs in criminal cases .
fanning , stephen push , who leads the survivors advocacy group families of september 11 , and 19 other people who lost relatives in the attacks recently signed on to the case . “ to give the trial that personal testimony is essential , ” said andreas schulz , who is co-representing the majority of the co-plaintiffs in the trial .
“ this trial was very abstract .
you see that nice young arab student and you can ’ t connect him to any mujahedeen warriors .
you can ’ t connect him to the 9/11 tragedy . ” defense attorneys for motassadeq , in jail since his arrest shortly after the attacks , maintain their client was merely friends with the hamburg-based al qaeda sleeper cell and had no knowledge of their plans .
but prosecutors are convinced he played a more integral role , taking care of the cell ’ s financial matters , handling bank accounts and paying some of their bills . fanning thinks the same .
she didn ’ t hesitate when push asked her three weeks ago whether she wanted to come and testify .
thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .
“ thanks for representing my dad , ” deangelis told fanning as she was about to board the plane .
on thursday in court , she wore a pin that deangelis had made to honor her dad . after all , fanning said , “ it ’ s not just about jack fanning , it ’ s about every single innocent victim , about every family that ’ s been destroyed .
it ’ s about the world at large . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

here are translated excerpts from the interview conducted by the public television station zdf .
zdf : a decision about iraq is about to be made .
will you maintain your position that germany will not vote for a war against iraq in the u.n. security council ?
schröder : the german position is unchanged .
by the way , i do n't think that a decision will be made immediately .
we are working on the issue of getting the inspectors the extra time they need .
that means that -lrb- a decision -rrb- naturally is not about to be made .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a zdf interview that he would turn over new evidence next wednesday .
could that change your mind ?
first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .
our american allies likely see that differently , mr. chancellor .
i think that i have made the german position clear .
i also know colin powell to be one of the most serious international discussion partners i have ever met , and i am rather certain that the americans will understand the position i have just described . ...
the americans know in particular that on similar matters , such as our participation in enduring freedom or our engagement in afghanistan , we have given no one reason to doubt our commitment to the fight against terrorism or to go so far as to question our commitment to fulfilling our obligations to the alliance -lrb- north atlantic treaty organization -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

here are translated excerpts from the interview conducted by the public television station zdf .
zdf : a decision about iraq is about to be made .
will you maintain your position that germany will not vote for a war against iraq in the u.n. security council ?
schröder : the german position is unchanged .
by the way , i do n't think that a decision will be made immediately .
we are working on the issue of getting the inspectors the extra time they need .
that means that -lrb- a decision -rrb- naturally is not about to be made .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a zdf interview that he would turn over new evidence next wednesday .
could that change your mind ?
first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .
our american allies likely see that differently , mr. chancellor .
i think that i have made the german position clear .
i also know colin powell to be one of the most serious international discussion partners i have ever met , and i am rather certain that the americans will understand the position i have just described . ...
the americans know in particular that on similar matters , such as our participation in enduring freedom or our engagement in afghanistan , we have given no one reason to doubt our commitment to the fight against terrorism or to go so far as to question our commitment to fulfilling our obligations to the alliance -lrb- north atlantic treaty organization -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

“ my heart was broken on 9/11 , but not my spirit .
until i take my last breath , i will not let this incredible loss of human life go in vain . ” mounir motassadeq looked on impassively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this courtroom drawing taken during the trial against mounir el motassadeq in hamburg , northern germany , on tuesday , oct .
22 , 2002 , shows in foreground the defendant mounir el motassadeq and in rear from left the defendant 's lawyers hartmut jacobi and hans leitstritz , the judges lutz von selle and albrecht mentz .
mounir el motassadeq is accused of aiding the hamburg terrorist cell involved in the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
-lrb- ap photo / zeichnung : juliane garstka -rrb- it was the same reaction he had for each of the five americans who testified thursday as representatives of 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
the court 's seven judges , led by albrecht mentz , must determine in these final days of the trial whether motassadeq -lrb- illustration -rrb- , an electrical engineering student , should spend up to 15 years in prison for his alleged role as an accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people who died in the attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center and on the united airlines flight 93 jet that crashed in a pennsylvania field . families speak german law allows for survivors of crimes and relatives of murder victims to join the prosecution as co-plaintiffs in criminal cases .
fanning , stephen push , who leads the survivors advocacy group families of september 11 , and 19 other people who lost relatives in the attacks recently signed on to the case . “ to give the trial that personal testimony is essential , ” said andreas schulz , who is co-representing the majority of the co-plaintiffs in the trial .
“ this trial was very abstract .
you see that nice young arab student and you can ’ t connect him to any mujahedeen warriors .
you can ’ t connect him to the 9/11 tragedy . ” defense attorneys for motassadeq , in jail since his arrest shortly after the attacks , maintain their client was merely friends with the hamburg-based al qaeda sleeper cell and had no knowledge of their plans .
but prosecutors are convinced he played a more integral role , taking care of the cell ’ s financial matters , handling bank accounts and paying some of their bills . fanning thinks the same .
she didn ’ t hesitate when push asked her three weeks ago whether she wanted to come and testify .
thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .
“ thanks for representing my dad , ” deangelis told fanning as she was about to board the plane .
on thursday in court , she wore a pin that deangelis had made to honor her dad . after all , fanning said , “ it ’ s not just about jack fanning , it ’ s about every single innocent victim , about every family that ’ s been destroyed .

11 attacks on the united states .
-lrb- ap photo / zeichnung : juliane garstka -rrb- it was the same reaction he had for each of the five americans who testified thursday as representatives of 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
the court 's seven judges , led by albrecht mentz , must determine in these final days of the trial whether motassadeq -lrb- illustration -rrb- , an electrical engineering student , should spend up to 15 years in prison for his alleged role as an accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people who died in the attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center and on the united airlines flight 93 jet that crashed in a pennsylvania field . families speak german law allows for survivors of crimes and relatives of murder victims to join the prosecution as co-plaintiffs in criminal cases .
fanning , stephen push , who leads the survivors advocacy group families of september 11 , and 19 other people who lost relatives in the attacks recently signed on to the case . “ to give the trial that personal testimony is essential , ” said andreas schulz , who is co-representing the majority of the co-plaintiffs in the trial .

you can ’ t connect him to the 9/11 tragedy . ” defense attorneys for motassadeq , in jail since his arrest shortly after the attacks , maintain their client was merely friends with the hamburg-based al qaeda sleeper cell and had no knowledge of their plans .
but prosecutors are convinced he played a more integral role , taking care of the cell ’ s financial matters , handling bank accounts and paying some of their bills . fanning thinks the same .
she didn ’ t hesitate when push asked her three weeks ago whether she wanted to come and testify .
thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .

here are translated excerpts from the interview conducted by the public television station zdf .
zdf : a decision about iraq is about to be made .
will you maintain your position that germany will not vote for a war against iraq in the u.n. security council ?
schröder : the german position is unchanged .
by the way , i do n't think that a decision will be made immediately .
we are working on the issue of getting the inspectors the extra time they need .
that means that -lrb- a decision -rrb- naturally is not about to be made .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a zdf interview that he would turn over new evidence next wednesday .
could that change your mind ?
first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .
our american allies likely see that differently , mr. chancellor .
i think that i have made the german position clear .
i also know colin powell to be one of the most serious international discussion partners i have ever met , and i am rather certain that the americans will understand the position i have just described . ...
the americans know in particular that on similar matters , such as our participation in enduring freedom or our engagement in afghanistan , we have given no one reason to doubt our commitment to the fight against terrorism or to go so far as to question our commitment to fulfilling our obligations to the alliance -lrb- north atlantic treaty organization -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

“ my heart was broken on 9/11 , but not my spirit .
until i take my last breath , i will not let this incredible loss of human life go in vain . ” mounir motassadeq looked on impassively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this courtroom drawing taken during the trial against mounir el motassadeq in hamburg , northern germany , on tuesday , oct .
22 , 2002 , shows in foreground the defendant mounir el motassadeq and in rear from left the defendant 's lawyers hartmut jacobi and hans leitstritz , the judges lutz von selle and albrecht mentz .
mounir el motassadeq is accused of aiding the hamburg terrorist cell involved in the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
-lrb- ap photo / zeichnung : juliane garstka -rrb- it was the same reaction he had for each of the five americans who testified thursday as representatives of 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
the court 's seven judges , led by albrecht mentz , must determine in these final days of the trial whether motassadeq -lrb- illustration -rrb- , an electrical engineering student , should spend up to 15 years in prison for his alleged role as an accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people who died in the attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center and on the united airlines flight 93 jet that crashed in a pennsylvania field . families speak german law allows for survivors of crimes and relatives of murder victims to join the prosecution as co-plaintiffs in criminal cases .
fanning , stephen push , who leads the survivors advocacy group families of september 11 , and 19 other people who lost relatives in the attacks recently signed on to the case . “ to give the trial that personal testimony is essential , ” said andreas schulz , who is co-representing the majority of the co-plaintiffs in the trial .
“ this trial was very abstract .
you see that nice young arab student and you can ’ t connect him to any mujahedeen warriors .
you can ’ t connect him to the 9/11 tragedy . ” defense attorneys for motassadeq , in jail since his arrest shortly after the attacks , maintain their client was merely friends with the hamburg-based al qaeda sleeper cell and had no knowledge of their plans .
but prosecutors are convinced he played a more integral role , taking care of the cell ’ s financial matters , handling bank accounts and paying some of their bills . fanning thinks the same .
she didn ’ t hesitate when push asked her three weeks ago whether she wanted to come and testify .
thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .
“ thanks for representing my dad , ” deangelis told fanning as she was about to board the plane .
on thursday in court , she wore a pin that deangelis had made to honor her dad . after all , fanning said , “ it ’ s not just about jack fanning , it ’ s about every single innocent victim , about every family that ’ s been destroyed .

here are translated excerpts from the interview conducted by the public television station zdf .
zdf : a decision about iraq is about to be made .
will you maintain your position that germany will not vote for a war against iraq in the u.n. security council ?
schröder : the german position is unchanged .
by the way , i do n't think that a decision will be made immediately .
we are working on the issue of getting the inspectors the extra time they need .
that means that -lrb- a decision -rrb- naturally is not about to be made .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a zdf interview that he would turn over new evidence next wednesday .
could that change your mind ?
first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .
our american allies likely see that differently , mr. chancellor .
i think that i have made the german position clear .
i also know colin powell to be one of the most serious international discussion partners i have ever met , and i am rather certain that the americans will understand the position i have just described . ...
the americans know in particular that on similar matters , such as our participation in enduring freedom or our engagement in afghanistan , we have given no one reason to doubt our commitment to the fight against terrorism or to go so far as to question our commitment to fulfilling our obligations to the alliance -lrb- north atlantic treaty organization -rrb- . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

here are translated excerpts from the interview conducted by the public television station zdf .
zdf : a decision about iraq is about to be made .
will you maintain your position that germany will not vote for a war against iraq in the u.n. security council ?
schröder : the german position is unchanged .
by the way , i do n't think that a decision will be made immediately .
we are working on the issue of getting the inspectors the extra time they need .
that means that -lrb- a decision -rrb- naturally is not about to be made .
u.s. secretary of state colin powell said in a zdf interview that he would turn over new evidence next wednesday .
could that change your mind ?
first of all , it will be a good thing if the security council gets new evidence .
that would give the inspectors a better base for conducting their work .
i would have liked for this evidence - whatever it may be - to have been released earlier and to have been handed over to the inspectors so that they could have studied the matter .
but it is still a good idea to release the evidence , and i think that it must be examined and studied by the inspectors - they are the experts .
that means that they will need more time .
that is our position - and not only ours , by the way .
once again , mr. chancellor .
if there is evidence and this evidence can be examined , could that change the german position ?
i think people are deluding themselves about the meaning of our position .
it is strongly based and built on principles .
i think any sort of theoretical discussion can not shake this principle-based position .
we have always clearly said that we want to do everything - and we mean everything - to avoid a war and to see that resolution 1441 is enforced through peaceful means .
we are in close agreement with the french on this question , and that is a good thing .
i also think that we should be interested , also as part of our public debate , in seeing that war does not become a nearly normal means of conducting international affairs .
that can not be allowed to happen , and i think that we germans in particular know why that can not be allowed to happen and therefore understand why we are especially sensitive .
you will maintain this fundamental position , no matter what evidence is put on the table ?
our fundamental position is unchanged .
if france voted yes -lrb- in the security council -rrb- , would n't germany change its position ?
i do n't understand that .
we are discussing questions of war and peace here .
and you are discussing them in a way , if i may say , excuse me , that is not appropriate .
our american allies likely see that differently , mr. chancellor .
i think that i have made the german position clear .
i also know colin powell to be one of the most serious international discussion partners i have ever met , and i am rather certain that the americans will understand the position i have just described . ...

11 attacks that claimed her husband jack 's life at the age of 54 . but she did n't want to miss the opportunity to let the 28-year-old moroccan - who german federal prosecutors believe provided logistical expertise to presumed sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta - know what sort of damage he and “ his friends ” had done . and she traveled 3,000 miles to hamburg to do it - at her own expense . “ the world has to be protected from the suicidal , murderous inclinations of the defendant and his friends , ” she told the judges at hamburg ’ s higher regional court on thursday , pausing as a translator delivered the message in german .
“ my heart was broken on 9/11 , but not my spirit .
until i take my last breath , i will not let this incredible loss of human life go in vain . ” mounir motassadeq looked on impassively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this courtroom drawing taken during the trial against mounir el motassadeq in hamburg , northern germany , on tuesday , oct .
22 , 2002 , shows in foreground the defendant mounir el motassadeq and in rear from left the defendant 's lawyers hartmut jacobi and hans leitstritz , the judges lutz von selle and albrecht mentz .
mounir el motassadeq is accused of aiding the hamburg terrorist cell involved in the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
-lrb- ap photo / zeichnung : juliane garstka -rrb- it was the same reaction he had for each of the five americans who testified thursday as representatives of 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
the court 's seven judges , led by albrecht mentz , must determine in these final days of the trial whether motassadeq -lrb- illustration -rrb- , an electrical engineering student , should spend up to 15 years in prison for his alleged role as an accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people who died in the attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center and on the united airlines flight 93 jet that crashed in a pennsylvania field . families speak german law allows for survivors of crimes and relatives of murder victims to join the prosecution as co-plaintiffs in criminal cases .
fanning , stephen push , who leads the survivors advocacy group families of september 11 , and 19 other people who lost relatives in the attacks recently signed on to the case . “ to give the trial that personal testimony is essential , ” said andreas schulz , who is co-representing the majority of the co-plaintiffs in the trial .
“ this trial was very abstract .
you see that nice young arab student and you can ’ t connect him to any mujahedeen warriors .
you can ’ t connect him to the 9/11 tragedy . ” defense attorneys for motassadeq , in jail since his arrest shortly after the attacks , maintain their client was merely friends with the hamburg-based al qaeda sleeper cell and had no knowledge of their plans .
but prosecutors are convinced he played a more integral role , taking care of the cell ’ s financial matters , handling bank accounts and paying some of their bills . fanning thinks the same .
she didn ’ t hesitate when push asked her three weeks ago whether she wanted to come and testify .
thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .
“ thanks for representing my dad , ” deangelis told fanning as she was about to board the plane .
on thursday in court , she wore a pin that deangelis had made to honor her dad . after all , fanning said , “ it ’ s not just about jack fanning , it ’ s about every single innocent victim , about every family that ’ s been destroyed .
it ’ s about the world at large . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but other leaders on the continent are still strongly opposed to a war in the region . european leaders were deeply divided on thursday over the possibility that the united states would launch a war against the regime of saddam hussein .
in an appeal that appeared in 12 continental newspapers , the leaders of eight european countries called on their citizens to support the united states in its effort to find any weapons of mass destruction held by iraq .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the article , which appeared on the newspaper 's opinion pages .
the call of support was signed by british prime minister tony blair , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , outgoing czech republic president vaclav havel and the leaders of portugal , denmark , hungary and poland .
the appeal was issued three days after u.n. weapons inspectors issued their first report on their work and said iraq had failed to cooperate adequately with teams seeking to assess its ability to produce and use weapons of mass destruction .
in thursday 's appeal , the european leaders said saddam was continuing his deceptive practices .
" we can not allow a dictator to systematically violate u.n. resolutions , " the appeal said .
critics respond to appeal the article generated an immediate reply from european critics of bush and his possible war plans .
in brussels , members of the european union 's parliament passed a resolution in which they warned the united states against carrying out an attack without authorization of the united nations .
the lawmakers , voting 287-209 , also acknowledged that the weapons inspectors had uncovered violations of u.n. resolutions , but that these violations did not justify a military operation .
members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .
the chancellor 's decision was based on germany 's obligations to the north atlantic treaty organization .
but a second parliamentary study conducted into the issue contradicted this position .
it said that an attack against iraq would not involve defense of the alliance and that a u.n. resolution that goes beyond previous decisions would be necessary .
after the reports were released , a u.s.spokeswoman told dw-world that american leaders expected no changes in the german position on use of the bases .

but other leaders on the continent are still strongly opposed to a war in the region . european leaders were deeply divided on thursday over the possibility that the united states would launch a war against the regime of saddam hussein .
in an appeal that appeared in 12 continental newspapers , the leaders of eight european countries called on their citizens to support the united states in its effort to find any weapons of mass destruction held by iraq .
" europe and america must stand together , " said the article , which appeared on the newspaper 's opinion pages .
the call of support was signed by british prime minister tony blair , spanish prime minister jose maria aznar , italian prime minister silvio berlusconi , outgoing czech republic president vaclav havel and the leaders of portugal , denmark , hungary and poland .
the appeal was issued three days after u.n. weapons inspectors issued their first report on their work and said iraq had failed to cooperate adequately with teams seeking to assess its ability to produce and use weapons of mass destruction .
in thursday 's appeal , the european leaders said saddam was continuing his deceptive practices .
" we can not allow a dictator to systematically violate u.n. resolutions , " the appeal said .
critics respond to appeal the article generated an immediate reply from european critics of bush and his possible war plans .
in brussels , members of the european union 's parliament passed a resolution in which they warned the united states against carrying out an attack without authorization of the united nations .
the lawmakers , voting 287-209 , also acknowledged that the weapons inspectors had uncovered violations of u.n. resolutions , but that these violations did not justify a military operation .
members of a separate european organization also warned the united states against conducting a war without approval of the u.n. security council , saying that under current circumstances a military attack is not justified .
the resolution was passed by the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe .
the council , based in strasbourg , france , is a 44-member organization that promotes human rights and democracy .
it is not part of the european union .
among the critics at the european council on thursday was the president of austria , thomas klestil .
he raised questions about the evidence that the united states has about iraqi weapons and warned bush against conducting a preventive strike .
bush vows to provide evidence to address such critics , president george w. bush said in his state of the union address on tuesday that he would provide the united nations with information about iraq 's weapons of mass destruction next wednesday .
administration officials said the data would show saddam was concealing chemical and biological weapons from inspectors , and was importing technology for long-range missile and nuclear weapons programs .
the doubts raised by the parliamentary members in europe are shared by citizens across the continent as well , according to a new survey .
four-fifths of europeans would oppose a u.s. war launched with a u.n. mandate , according the survey conducted by gallup europe in wavre , belgium .
the survey was conducted among 15,000 people living in 30 countries .
many germans , including chancellor gerhard schröder , also oppose any war on iraq .
and on thursday , they learned of a possible way that their country could slow any u.s. military action .
a report issued by a parliamentary lawyer said germany could prohibit the united states from using its bases in germany if it launched a war against iraq without u.n. authorization .
such a prohibition could present a major obstacle for the united states , which relies heavily on air bases in germany and has thousands of soldiers stationed throughout the southern half of the country .
report contradicts chancellor the report said the united states did not have the right to carry out " single-handed preventive attacks from the federal republic of germany . "
the issue was examined at the request of a lawmaker , hans-peter uhl , a member of the bavarian-based opposition party the christian social union .
the finding conflicts with a decision already made by schröder .
in november , he assured u.s. leaders that they could use the bases whenever they wanted .

11 attacks that claimed her husband jack 's life at the age of 54 . but she did n't want to miss the opportunity to let the 28-year-old moroccan - who german federal prosecutors believe provided logistical expertise to presumed sept .
11 mastermind mohammed atta - know what sort of damage he and “ his friends ” had done . and she traveled 3,000 miles to hamburg to do it - at her own expense . “ the world has to be protected from the suicidal , murderous inclinations of the defendant and his friends , ” she told the judges at hamburg ’ s higher regional court on thursday , pausing as a translator delivered the message in german .
“ my heart was broken on 9/11 , but not my spirit .
until i take my last breath , i will not let this incredible loss of human life go in vain . ” mounir motassadeq looked on impassively . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this courtroom drawing taken during the trial against mounir el motassadeq in hamburg , northern germany , on tuesday , oct .
22 , 2002 , shows in foreground the defendant mounir el motassadeq and in rear from left the defendant 's lawyers hartmut jacobi and hans leitstritz , the judges lutz von selle and albrecht mentz .
mounir el motassadeq is accused of aiding the hamburg terrorist cell involved in the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
-lrb- ap photo / zeichnung : juliane garstka -rrb- it was the same reaction he had for each of the five americans who testified thursday as representatives of 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
the court 's seven judges , led by albrecht mentz , must determine in these final days of the trial whether motassadeq -lrb- illustration -rrb- , an electrical engineering student , should spend up to 15 years in prison for his alleged role as an accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people who died in the attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center and on the united airlines flight 93 jet that crashed in a pennsylvania field . families speak german law allows for survivors of crimes and relatives of murder victims to join the prosecution as co-plaintiffs in criminal cases .
fanning , stephen push , who leads the survivors advocacy group families of september 11 , and 19 other people who lost relatives in the attacks recently signed on to the case . “ to give the trial that personal testimony is essential , ” said andreas schulz , who is co-representing the majority of the co-plaintiffs in the trial .
“ this trial was very abstract .
you see that nice young arab student and you can ’ t connect him to any mujahedeen warriors .
you can ’ t connect him to the 9/11 tragedy . ” defense attorneys for motassadeq , in jail since his arrest shortly after the attacks , maintain their client was merely friends with the hamburg-based al qaeda sleeper cell and had no knowledge of their plans .
but prosecutors are convinced he played a more integral role , taking care of the cell ’ s financial matters , handling bank accounts and paying some of their bills . fanning thinks the same .
she didn ’ t hesitate when push asked her three weeks ago whether she wanted to come and testify .
thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .
“ thanks for representing my dad , ” deangelis told fanning as she was about to board the plane .
on thursday in court , she wore a pin that deangelis had made to honor her dad . after all , fanning said , “ it ’ s not just about jack fanning , it ’ s about every single innocent victim , about every family that ’ s been destroyed .
it ’ s about the world at large . ” andreas tzortzis send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

22 , 2002 , shows in foreground the defendant mounir el motassadeq and in rear from left the defendant 's lawyers hartmut jacobi and hans leitstritz , the judges lutz von selle and albrecht mentz .
mounir el motassadeq is accused of aiding the hamburg terrorist cell involved in the sept .
11 attacks on the united states .
-lrb- ap photo / zeichnung : juliane garstka -rrb- it was the same reaction he had for each of the five americans who testified thursday as representatives of 21 american co-plaintiffs in the trial .
the court 's seven judges , led by albrecht mentz , must determine in these final days of the trial whether motassadeq -lrb- illustration -rrb- , an electrical engineering student , should spend up to 15 years in prison for his alleged role as an accessory to the murder of more than 3,000 people who died in the attacks on the pentagon , the world trade center and on the united airlines flight 93 jet that crashed in a pennsylvania field . families speak german law allows for survivors of crimes and relatives of murder victims to join the prosecution as co-plaintiffs in criminal cases .
fanning , stephen push , who leads the survivors advocacy group families of september 11 , and 19 other people who lost relatives in the attacks recently signed on to the case . “ to give the trial that personal testimony is essential , ” said andreas schulz , who is co-representing the majority of the co-plaintiffs in the trial .
“ this trial was very abstract .
you see that nice young arab student and you can ’ t connect him to any mujahedeen warriors .
you can ’ t connect him to the 9/11 tragedy . ” defense attorneys for motassadeq , in jail since his arrest shortly after the attacks , maintain their client was merely friends with the hamburg-based al qaeda sleeper cell and had no knowledge of their plans .
but prosecutors are convinced he played a more integral role , taking care of the cell ’ s financial matters , handling bank accounts and paying some of their bills . fanning thinks the same .
she didn ’ t hesitate when push asked her three weeks ago whether she wanted to come and testify .
thursday marked the first time she laid eyes on motassadeq , and she was convinced of his guilt . “ he is not a mindless , illiterate , blind or innocent follower , ” she said . at the same time , she doesn ’ t want to dwell on why he might have done what he ’ s accused of doing . “ i can ’ t understanding anyone , or any group that could commit this sort of evil , ” she told dw-world in an interview following her testimony .
“ it doesn ’ t compute for me . ” what does make sense to her is what she lost .
fanning said her husband was “ her hero . ”
he was as real and genuine as the blue fire department uniform , covered in medals , she brought with her to hamburg to show the media .
she held it up as the cameras flashed and tv crews recorded . a family divided her husband was her partner , she said .
the couple , who met skiing in upstate new york more than 15 years ago , worked opposite shifts to care for their two autistic boys . with jack gone , maureen had to put her eldest , 14-year-old sean , in a group home where he could receive around-the-clock care .
she gave up her job as a registered nurse in a new york hospital and has two full-time tutors helping her care for 6-year-old patrick , who can ’ t read , write or speak . the family lives in the home her husband bought in nassau county and survives on jack fanning ’ s pension and social security .
like the other five who testified , maureen covered the more than $ 1,000 it cost to fly to and stay in hamburg for two days out of her own pocket .
but now she wants to get back to the kids , who have kept her grounded and focused . “ if the kids are okay , i ’ m okay , ” she said . she said she spent the three weeks leading up to her court appearance in hamburg coordinating care , not dwelling on her testimony . nicole deangelis , the daughter of a nyc firefighter who is in the same support group maureen attends , drove her to the airport before her flight to germany .
“ thanks for representing my dad , ” deangelis told fanning as she was about to board the plane .
on thursday in court , she wore a pin that deangelis had made to honor her dad . after all , fanning said , “ it ’ s not just about jack fanning , it ’ s about every single innocent victim , about every family that ’ s been destroyed .

unlike the former 's rich list , it wo n't concentrate on chronicling the individual bank balances of the seriously loaded .
the office for national statistics has told the bbc it is planning the first official national wealth survey .
the new survey could include collecting data on a range of wealth indicators , from secured loans , investments , possessions and pensions take-up to house prices - and is aimed at getting a better picture of the country 's and individual wealth .
people who take part in the survey may even become more wealthy in the process , as giving people a small cash incentive to take part in the survey is up for consideration .
nation 's first it is believed the data could be used to formulate fiscal and social policies and to link the government 's policies closer to people 's real wealth .
the survey has been considered by the government for some time , and has been discussed at a " wealth and asset steering group " .
it may focus on different " life stages " to get a better idea about how " wealth " changes throughout someone 's lifetime .
for example , the different wealth of someone coming up for retirement and someone in their twenties .
the survey could , for example , could track how many people hold pensions .
the traditional way wealth is measured is through household income , for example cash income .
but with the growth of mass share ownership and home ownership over the last few decades , the government is believed to be keen on adopting a more accurate measure .
it is unlikely to map the same individual 's spending and saving habits over time - so-called longitudinal analysis - because this is a very expensive way of collecting data .
instead , it is more likely to " map groups " or identify particular sections of people each time the survey was conducted .
the data could then be presented according to age , socio-economic class and possibly by region .
cash incentive ?
considering offering a cash incentive to take part in the survey would be one way of encouraging people to take part in the research .
this is not without precedent .
the ons already offers a small sum to people who take part in its household expenditure survey .
the survey is still in the planning stages , but could start in 2006 .

remains from the sterkfontein caves near johannesburg suggest our ancestors were less chimp-like than we thought .
the revelation follows the discovery of missing bones from a 3.5 million-year-old skeleton found in 1998 .
this sterkfontein individual was a climber in the trees and bipedal on the ground dr ron clarke fragments of pelvis , upper leg , ribs and backbone have recently been dug out of the rock , allowing scientists to piece together its gait .
the anatomy of the hominid , a member of the genus australopithecus , raises some interesting questions .
its bone structure shows it did not walk like modern chimps , using the knuckles of its hands .
it probably walked on two legs when it was on the ground but spent much of the time climbing trees , says dr ron clarke , of the university of the witwatersrand , who discovered the fossil .
tool-making dr clarke goes further .
he argues that the fact the hominid was not a knuckle-walker suggests chimps and humans are not as closely related as we thought .
knuckle-walking and vertical climbing - up and down tree trunks - are a specialisation of chimps and gorillas after humans split off from them dr robin crompton it pushes the last common ancestor of chimps and humans much further back in history , he says .
dr clarke sets out his position in the south african journal of science , which publishes the latest data .
" my conclusion from the limb proportions and the morphology of the foot and of the hand is that this sterkfontein individual was a climber in the trees -lrb- using its powerful thumb in a vice-like grip -rrb- and bipedal on the ground , " he says .
" it would appear , therefore , that the strong opposable thumb evolved in the human ancestral stock for grasping branches .
then , in the mainly terrestrial subsequent descendants in the form of homo , it was to prove useful for tool-making and manipulation .
" the suggestion in reconstructions and in the scientific literature that human ancestors were transformed into an upright position from a knuckle-walking ancestor is not supported by this new and important addition to the fossil record . "
fresh debate other experts in human evolution are more circumspect .
professor chris stringer of london 's natural history museum says the idea that humans and chimps derive from a knuckle-walking common ancestor is " not a majority view " .
the peculiar gait of chimps and gorillas could have developed after the three lines diverged , he says .
dr robin crompton , of the university of liverpool , agrees .
he says there is " very strong " genetic evidence that we are closely related to chimps -lrb- and bonobos -rrb- .
" it is likely that the common ancestor of the african apes , including ourselves , was arboreal , " he told bbc news online .
" in my view , knuckle-walking and vertical climbing - up and down tree trunks - are a specialisation of chimps and gorillas after humans split off from them . "
sterkfontein is probably the richest site on earth for the fossils of early hominids , and the ancient cave system is now part of a world heritage site .
some 600 hominid fossils from the sterkfontein caves have now been collected and classified .
the early humans they represent are thought to have fallen to their deaths in the caves when the limestone complex first broke the surface .

the attack from leftwinger george galloway comes after union leaders called their latest meeting with mr prescott . "
a number of ideas are beginning to emerge about ways of moving forward " brendan barber tuc leader-elect firefighters returned to work on thursday after a 48-hour strike in the ongoing pay dispute .
after he met mr prescott , tuc general secretary elect brendan barber said ideas were now emerging to end the deadlock .
but mr galloway argued the deputy prime minister , a former trade union official , had become a " cabinet patsy , put up to stab the firefighters in the back " .
the glasgow mp , who backed mr prescott 's labour leadership bid in 1994 , told bbc one 's question time , his actions had " turned the stomach of genuine , decent labour people " .
mr prescott this week threatened to impose a pay rise on striking firefighters .
another 48-hour strike is due to go ahead this weekend , with employers refusing to negotiate while the threat of industrial action continues .
andy gilchrist , leader of the fire brigades ' union , brought other union leaders up to date about the dispute .
talks breakthrough ?
later , mr barber , along with bill morris of the transport and general workers ' union and davis prentis of unison , met mr prescott in whitehall .
mr barber described the meeting as " very useful " , saying : " a number of ideas are beginning to emerge about ways of moving forward .
" we hope we can move to a position where negotiations can resume . "
while union leaders had raised fears about the threat of an imposed settlement , mr barber said they hoped it would not be an issue if a deal was reached .
mr prescott told his cabinet colleagues he hoped to get into " serious negotiation " towards a settlement .
praise for prescott after that cabinet meeting , tony blair 's official spokesman said : " everybody hoped that people now regarded that it was time to get it sorted out .
" the prime minister paid tribute to mr prescott 's excellent handling of the dispute and this was warmly endorsed by other members of the cabinet . "
mr gilchrist welcomed the trade unionists ' talks with mr prescott , saying anything which could restart negotiations should be explored .
the conservatives are pressing mr prescott to seek an injunction under trade union laws to stop further strikes .

federal police commissioner mick keelty said the militant group jemaah islamiah , widely blamed for the bali bombing , had plotted a second attack in indonesia late last year .
it 's clear that they were not only sophisticated but they were very determined in what they were going to do mick keelty , australian federal police commissioner but he told australian public radio that police action had prevented a repeat of the bali atrocity which killed nearly 200 people , around half of them australian tourists .
thirty suspects have been arrested in connection with the twin bomb blasts on kuta beach , including the reputed mastermind imam samudra and ali imron , who police say drove one of the vans packed with explosives .
mr keelty declined to say where in indonesia the second attack was to have occurred .
" the attack was a second attack in indonesia that has been foiled through the arrest of the people responsible , particularly samudra and ali imron , " he told the australian broadcasting corporation .
" it 's clear that they were not only sophisticated but they were very determined in what they were going to do , " he said .
officials say evidence is growing against abu bakar ba 'asyir " if it was n't for the work of the indonesian national police , helped by australian police , i think we would have probably had another event occur using the skills and the knowledge that jemaah islamiah has accumulated over time . "
mr keelty added that there was growing evidence linking a senior islamic cleric , abu bakar ba 'asyir , to the bali bombing .
earlier this week , indonesian authorities said the alleged spiritual leader of jemaah islamiah was likely to be charged in connection with the attack .
but first the cleric will be tried or released on charges linked to a series of church bombings in indonesia in december 2000 and an alleged assassination plot against megawati sukarnoputri before she became indonesian president .

a report in friday 's british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- magazine called new instrument sterilisation processes " shambolic " .
it said the system , introduced by the scottish executive , was putting lives at risk .
the scottish national party has called for an inquiry .
doctors claim that on some occasions patients were brought round from anaesthetic without surgery taking place because all available equipment was visibly dirty .
dirty instruments patients needs come first and waiting times will increase if this issue is not dealt with effectively dr janet jenkins the executive admitted there had been " teething problems " - but said it had not received any reports of cancelled operations .
dr janet jenkins , deputy chairwoman of the bma scottish committee for hospital medical services , said the problem related to the implementation of the new sterilisation system .
she said health trusts were trying to comply with the recommendations of the glennie framework , the first report from the scottish executive 's sterile services provision review group .
the report , published in 2001 , said groups of hospitals should be working towards establishing centralised , automated decontamination services by 2004 .
dr jenkins said : " nhs lothian bought machines but they leave debris on the instruments . "
she added that some instruments , particularly those with spring mechanisms , could not be cleaned by machines .
dr jenkins wants immediate action by the scottish executive - which has instructed trusts to make the changes .
system testing she said it should ensure systems were tested before being introduced and that more thought should be given to the type of machines and instruments needed to make the cleaning process more thorough .
her view was backed by tayside consultant orthopaedic , surgeon richard buckley .
he said : " we 're regularly cancelling hip replacement operations .
" the turnaround time to clean instruments is supposed to be 24 hours but it 's longer than that . "
there have been no reports of hospitals having to cancel operations scottish executive spokeswoman dr jenkins said : " by raising this issue with the executive , the bma is highlighting that there is a problem throughout scotland .
" we hope that the executive can strive to improve the situation by re-examining the current system in place .
" patients needs come first and waiting times will increase if this issue is not dealt with effectively . "
an executive spokeswoman said it was aware that some trusts experienced teething problems with the installation of new equipment .
but she said : " there have been no reports of hospitals having to cancel operations or indeed patients being ' woken ' on the way to theatre as a result .
" if there is any evidence of operations being cancelled because of the decontamination process the executive would like to see it . "
the snp 's health spokeswoman nicola sturgeon said : " this is a complete waste of time and money and must be a dreadful experience for the patients concerned .
" there must be an urgent inquiry into what has gone wrong with new procedures for centralising decontamination services and action taken urgently to redress the situation . " watch / listen on this story dr janet jenkins " patients have not been directly harmed because we have detected the problem " health correspondent eleanor bradford " the bma said there were lessons to be learned .
