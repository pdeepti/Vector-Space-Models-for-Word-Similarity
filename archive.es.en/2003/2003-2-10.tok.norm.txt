a rocket attack near the german camp shortly after the hand-over ceremony emphasized the instability of the situation there . german defense minister peter struck 's visit to kabul on monday for the transfer of peacekeeping duties there from turkey to germany and the netherlands was interrupted by two missiles which exploded near the german camp in the afghan capital just hours after the handover .
while neither people nor property were damaged , the attack proved that comments struck had made earlier in the day were premature " i don ’ t see any reason to assume that the soldiers and i will be in danger , " the defense minister had said .
the two missiles struck around 500 meters -lrb- 500 yards -rrb- away from the german camp .
the german authorities in afghanistan are investigating the incident .
change at the helm of isaf germany and the netherlands have agreed to share responsibilities for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in and around kabul for the next six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck shortly before the hand-over in kabul struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he expects the foreign peacekeepers to leave afghanistan after the next afghan elections , scheduled for 2004 .
stabile structures will allow " the presence of foreign troops and the bundeswehr to be brought to an end , " the minister said .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer recently indicated that the bundeswehr could be in afghanistan much longer .
successor up in the air it is still unclear who will take isaf ’ s reigns over after the germans and dutch finish their tour .
struck said that the bundeswehr would remain in the country until september at the latest .
on monday he conferred with afghan president hamid karsai about the issue , suggesting that nato could assume the leadership of isaf in autumn 2003 .
after their meeting karsai announced that afghanistan would be happy with anyone .
struck later announced that he and his dutch counterpart , henk kamp , will discuss the issue with nato .
mission wo n't be easy during the handover ceremony defense minister struck affirmed that the mission in afghanistan is the greatest challenge the bundeswehr has yet faced .
while the germans have already committed 1,400 soldiers to the peacekeeping operation , 1,100 more will be added to the mission under german-dutch leadership .
the netherlands has sent 700 soldiers to support the undertaking .

general norbert van heyst -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has until now led the german-dutch corps in münster , is isaf ’ s new commander .
the german troops are headed by general friedrich riechmann , the commander of the german deployment in potsdam .
" our military capabilities are limited , " general riechmann told dw-radio .
after all some 10,000 bundeswehr soldiers are involved in peacekeeping operations all over the world at present .
that ’ s why we ’ re happy that the dutch were prepared to take over part of the responsibility .
that ’ s one of the most important prerequisites .
we couldn ’ t have shouldered the responsibility alone , " he said .
complex responsibilities general riechmann will lead the troops , which come from 30 nations , while acting as the contact person for the afghan government as well as for the united nations and other aid organizations .
riechmann is also expected to keep in touch with the u.s. army , which , though not involved in the peacekeeping exercises , is still engaged in combat in afghanistan .
furthermore , the bundeswehr is responsible for security at the international airport in kabul , where riots and skirmishes have taken place in the past .
mission fraught with dangers security is the main issue as the 2,500 bundeswehr soldiers on the ground will have to cope with an unsafe environment .
strict security precautions were taken for the ceremony on monday .
the german foreign intelligence service had warned of possible attacks on the german camp and german soldiers before the isaf leadership handover .
the missile attack near the german camp in kabul on monday is only the most recent in a series of incidents .
in january three missiles struck near the german camp , though no one was injured .
in december , seven bundeswehr and two dutch soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash caused by machine failure .
before struck ’ s departure for kabul he announced there were indications of increased terrorist activities by armed taliban fighters and followers of the fundamentalist military leader , gulbuddin hekmatyar .
sceptical of extension the afghan government would like to see isaf ’ s area of responsibilities extended beyond kabul and vicinity , an idea that the united states is said to be considering .
but germany maintains that it does not have the capacity to enlarge its area of responsibility .
" that ’ s definitely a question of how much manpower we have , " general riechmann told dw-radio .
" we germans would not be in a position to undertake such a mission , and even the other nations couldn ’ t .
that ’ s why i think that the principle of building a ‘ safe haven ’ in kabul as a source from which to develop a new law and order system is the best way .

germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq . in a decision that could shake the north atlantic treaty organization , france and belgium vetoed efforts on monday to prepare to give turkey military support in the event that the alliance member came under attack during a u.s.-led war against iraq , sources said .
the move came with explicit support of the german government .
in response to the veto , turkey plans to demand that the alliance reconsider the issue on monday , the turkish television station ntv reported .
the turkish government plans to cite an article in the north atlantic treaty that established the alliance in 1949 .
" the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened , " the article says . the veto by france and belgium did not come as a surprise .
on thursday , the alliance put off a decision on the issue because of the disagreement .
at the time , nato secretary general george robertson said : " where there has been a disagreement is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan . "
belgium and france raise objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's foreign minister louis michel the decision to delay a decision was followed by statements sunday from belgian foreign minister louis michel that his country would block the matter and from france that it might do likewise .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive three forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance , patriot missiles to provide air defense , and special forces to combat biological and chemical weapons .
the request is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
the issue becomes complicated for germany because its servicemembers serve in the surveillance planes .
if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they should remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
concerns of the u.s. the issue is also sensitive to the united states .
at a security conference held in munich over the weekend , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the dispute could endanger the alliance .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that -lrb- veteoing the plan -rrb- .
it is beyond my comprehension . ...
turkey is an ally .

as germany 's negotiator for the icc , kaul has been a strong advocate for an independent court . hans-peter kaul will be the one german among 18 judges to be sworn in by queen beatrix of the netherlands on march 11 to preside at the world 's first permanent criminal court .
kaul was elected to the position on friday at united nations headquarters in new york .
he received 57 out of a possible 85 votes .
the 59-year-old career diplomat and expert in humanitarian law has helped shape the icc on the behalf of germany .
he has been a long-time supporter of the idea of the tribunal as a venu to try individuals before a court of law for crimes against humanity that states are unwilling or unable to try themselves .
diplomat lawyer born in 1943 , kaul completed his first law degree in heidelberg in 1971 before going on to study in cambridge , paris and the hague .
he then returned to heidelberg , where he passed his bar exam in 1975 .
although trained as a jurist , kaul entered the diplomatic corps shortly after completing his studies , serving in consulates in norway , tel aviv and washington before becoming first counselor at germany 's mission to the united nations in 1993 .
kaul has worked toward the establishment of the court since 1996 , when he was involved with preparations leading up to the rome statute , the 1998 agreement that sets out the court 's jurisdiction , structure and functions .
he remained head of germany 's office for public international law even as the government changed hands in 1998 , much to the delight of nongovernmental organizations involved in the icc project , since many saw in kaul an engaged and cooperative partner who consistently worked toward designing an effective , independent and workable court .

his tenure in the hague is expected to last three years .

a total of 139 countries have signed the treaty creating the court , with 88 ratifying it so far .
although the newly elected judges , eleven men and seven women , will be sworn in in march , the key task of naming a prosecutor will not begin until april 21 .
a fully functioning staff is not expected to be in place until the end of summer .
when the court does begin operations , its task will be to try some of the world 's most egregious crimes , such as mass murder , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it will only be able to try cases for crimes that were committed after july 1 , 2002 .
one notable absence from the icc 's list of supporters is the united states , which has never been very comfortable with the idea behind the international body , even under the clinton administration .

as germany 's negotiator for the icc , kaul has been a strong advocate for an independent court . hans-peter kaul will be the one german among 18 judges to be sworn in by queen beatrix of the netherlands on march 11 to preside at the world 's first permanent criminal court .
kaul was elected to the position on friday at united nations headquarters in new york .
he received 57 out of a possible 85 votes .
the 59-year-old career diplomat and expert in humanitarian law has helped shape the icc on the behalf of germany .
he has been a long-time supporter of the idea of the tribunal as a venu to try individuals before a court of law for crimes against humanity that states are unwilling or unable to try themselves .
diplomat lawyer born in 1943 , kaul completed his first law degree in heidelberg in 1971 before going on to study in cambridge , paris and the hague .
he then returned to heidelberg , where he passed his bar exam in 1975 .
although trained as a jurist , kaul entered the diplomatic corps shortly after completing his studies , serving in consulates in norway , tel aviv and washington before becoming first counselor at germany 's mission to the united nations in 1993 .
kaul has worked toward the establishment of the court since 1996 , when he was involved with preparations leading up to the rome statute , the 1998 agreement that sets out the court 's jurisdiction , structure and functions .
he remained head of germany 's office for public international law even as the government changed hands in 1998 , much to the delight of nongovernmental organizations involved in the icc project , since many saw in kaul an engaged and cooperative partner who consistently worked toward designing an effective , independent and workable court .
in 2002 , kaul accepted an appointment as the head of the foreign office 's commission for the icc .
the jurist is married with four children and speaks german , english , french and norwegian .
his tenure in the hague is expected to last three years .
modelled on nuremberg the international criminal court is based on principles of the tribunals set up at the end of wwii to try german and japanese leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
a total of 139 countries have signed the treaty creating the court , with 88 ratifying it so far .
although the newly elected judges , eleven men and seven women , will be sworn in in march , the key task of naming a prosecutor will not begin until april 21 .
a fully functioning staff is not expected to be in place until the end of summer .
when the court does begin operations , its task will be to try some of the world 's most egregious crimes , such as mass murder , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it will only be able to try cases for crimes that were committed after july 1 , 2002 .
one notable absence from the icc 's list of supporters is the united states , which has never been very comfortable with the idea behind the international body , even under the clinton administration .
george w. bush has spurned the court , withdrawing his predecessor 's signature from the treaty and arguing that the court could be used for political ends , with malicious prosecutors bringing charges against u.s. peacekeepers or soldiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq . in a decision that could shake the north atlantic treaty organization , france and belgium vetoed efforts on monday to prepare to give turkey military support in the event that the alliance member came under attack during a u.s.-led war against iraq , sources said .
the move came with explicit support of the german government .
in response to the veto , turkey plans to demand that the alliance reconsider the issue on monday , the turkish television station ntv reported .
the turkish government plans to cite an article in the north atlantic treaty that established the alliance in 1949 .
" the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened , " the article says . the veto by france and belgium did not come as a surprise .
on thursday , the alliance put off a decision on the issue because of the disagreement .
at the time , nato secretary general george robertson said : " where there has been a disagreement is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan . "
belgium and france raise objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's foreign minister louis michel the decision to delay a decision was followed by statements sunday from belgian foreign minister louis michel that his country would block the matter and from france that it might do likewise .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive three forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance , patriot missiles to provide air defense , and special forces to combat biological and chemical weapons .
the request is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
the issue becomes complicated for germany because its servicemembers serve in the surveillance planes .
if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they should remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
concerns of the u.s. the issue is also sensitive to the united states .
at a security conference held in munich over the weekend , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the dispute could endanger the alliance .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that -lrb- veteoing the plan -rrb- .
it is beyond my comprehension . ...
turkey is an ally .
the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld said saturday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

he received 57 out of a possible 85 votes .
the 59-year-old career diplomat and expert in humanitarian law has helped shape the icc on the behalf of germany .
he has been a long-time supporter of the idea of the tribunal as a venu to try individuals before a court of law for crimes against humanity that states are unwilling or unable to try themselves .
diplomat lawyer born in 1943 , kaul completed his first law degree in heidelberg in 1971 before going on to study in cambridge , paris and the hague .
he then returned to heidelberg , where he passed his bar exam in 1975 .
although trained as a jurist , kaul entered the diplomatic corps shortly after completing his studies , serving in consulates in norway , tel aviv and washington before becoming first counselor at germany 's mission to the united nations in 1993 .
kaul has worked toward the establishment of the court since 1996 , when he was involved with preparations leading up to the rome statute , the 1998 agreement that sets out the court 's jurisdiction , structure and functions .
he remained head of germany 's office for public international law even as the government changed hands in 1998 , much to the delight of nongovernmental organizations involved in the icc project , since many saw in kaul an engaged and cooperative partner who consistently worked toward designing an effective , independent and workable court .
in 2002 , kaul accepted an appointment as the head of the foreign office 's commission for the icc .
the jurist is married with four children and speaks german , english , french and norwegian .
his tenure in the hague is expected to last three years .
modelled on nuremberg the international criminal court is based on principles of the tribunals set up at the end of wwii to try german and japanese leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
a total of 139 countries have signed the treaty creating the court , with 88 ratifying it so far .
although the newly elected judges , eleven men and seven women , will be sworn in in march , the key task of naming a prosecutor will not begin until april 21 .
a fully functioning staff is not expected to be in place until the end of summer .
when the court does begin operations , its task will be to try some of the world 's most egregious crimes , such as mass murder , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it will only be able to try cases for crimes that were committed after july 1 , 2002 .
one notable absence from the icc 's list of supporters is the united states , which has never been very comfortable with the idea behind the international body , even under the clinton administration .
george w. bush has spurned the court , withdrawing his predecessor 's signature from the treaty and arguing that the court could be used for political ends , with malicious prosecutors bringing charges against u.s. peacekeepers or soldiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq . in a decision that could shake the north atlantic treaty organization , france and belgium vetoed efforts on monday to prepare to give turkey military support in the event that the alliance member came under attack during a u.s.-led war against iraq , sources said .
the move came with explicit support of the german government .
in response to the veto , turkey plans to demand that the alliance reconsider the issue on monday , the turkish television station ntv reported .
the turkish government plans to cite an article in the north atlantic treaty that established the alliance in 1949 .
" the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened , " the article says . the veto by france and belgium did not come as a surprise .
on thursday , the alliance put off a decision on the issue because of the disagreement .
at the time , nato secretary general george robertson said : " where there has been a disagreement is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan . "
belgium and france raise objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's foreign minister louis michel the decision to delay a decision was followed by statements sunday from belgian foreign minister louis michel that his country would block the matter and from france that it might do likewise .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive three forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance , patriot missiles to provide air defense , and special forces to combat biological and chemical weapons .
the request is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
the issue becomes complicated for germany because its servicemembers serve in the surveillance planes .
if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they should remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
concerns of the u.s. the issue is also sensitive to the united states .
at a security conference held in munich over the weekend , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the dispute could endanger the alliance .

the men 's team briefly struggled against poland in their final , while the women labored against a tough dutch side to eventually come out triumphant .
german men romp to 7-1 victory the german men went ahead thanks to early goals by brothers christian and oliver domke while matthias witthaus , björn emmerling and björn michel added later strikes to give the germans a convincing 5-1 halftime lead .

oliver domke , who scored germany 's winner against australia in last year 's outdoor world cup in malaysia , got his second point of the game four minutes after the restart .
the germans eventually romped home to a 7-1 victory to take the first men 's indoor world title in style .
women overcome resilient dutch earlier on sunday , the german women 's team struggled against the team from the netherlands but eventually secured the championship winning 5-2 , a score that belies the close nature of the contest .
germany played well in the first half and led 3-0 after 17 minutes through goals by franci gude , anneke böhmert and natasha keller .
the dutch replied with two goals by marianne van greenhuizen which pinned the germans back as halftime approached .

by the midway point of the second half , the germans were back in the ascendance .
gude scored her second goal of the match and effectively put the game beyond the reach of the dutch , who responded by sending their keeper into open play and attacking the germans with six field players .
the plan backfired and the germans took full advantage of the gaping defense with keller , who ended the tournament 's top scorer with 24 goals , breaking free to score her side 's fifth .
" my team played well and they deserve a huge compliment , " said german coach peter lemmen after the victory .
" it will take a few years for other countries to reach our standard . "
coach praises ' laurel and hardy ' lemmen , who is in his second year as coach of the team , said he was particularly impressed with the way keller and gude combined , although some might question his choice of analogy given their cohesive play .
" they fit together like laurel and hardy , " he said .

a rocket attack near the german camp shortly after the hand-over ceremony emphasized the instability of the situation there . german defense minister peter struck 's visit to kabul on monday for the transfer of peacekeeping duties there from turkey to germany and the netherlands was interrupted by two missiles which exploded near the german camp in the afghan capital just hours after the handover .
while neither people nor property were damaged , the attack proved that comments struck had made earlier in the day were premature " i don ’ t see any reason to assume that the soldiers and i will be in danger , " the defense minister had said .
the two missiles struck around 500 meters -lrb- 500 yards -rrb- away from the german camp .
the german authorities in afghanistan are investigating the incident .
change at the helm of isaf germany and the netherlands have agreed to share responsibilities for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in and around kabul for the next six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck shortly before the hand-over in kabul struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he expects the foreign peacekeepers to leave afghanistan after the next afghan elections , scheduled for 2004 .
stabile structures will allow " the presence of foreign troops and the bundeswehr to be brought to an end , " the minister said .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer recently indicated that the bundeswehr could be in afghanistan much longer .
successor up in the air it is still unclear who will take isaf ’ s reigns over after the germans and dutch finish their tour .
struck said that the bundeswehr would remain in the country until september at the latest .
on monday he conferred with afghan president hamid karsai about the issue , suggesting that nato could assume the leadership of isaf in autumn 2003 .
after their meeting karsai announced that afghanistan would be happy with anyone .
struck later announced that he and his dutch counterpart , henk kamp , will discuss the issue with nato .
mission wo n't be easy during the handover ceremony defense minister struck affirmed that the mission in afghanistan is the greatest challenge the bundeswehr has yet faced .
while the germans have already committed 1,400 soldiers to the peacekeeping operation , 1,100 more will be added to the mission under german-dutch leadership .
the netherlands has sent 700 soldiers to support the undertaking .

general norbert van heyst -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has until now led the german-dutch corps in münster , is isaf ’ s new commander .
the german troops are headed by general friedrich riechmann , the commander of the german deployment in potsdam .
" our military capabilities are limited , " general riechmann told dw-radio .
after all some 10,000 bundeswehr soldiers are involved in peacekeeping operations all over the world at present .
that ’ s why we ’ re happy that the dutch were prepared to take over part of the responsibility .
that ’ s one of the most important prerequisites .
we couldn ’ t have shouldered the responsibility alone , " he said .
complex responsibilities general riechmann will lead the troops , which come from 30 nations , while acting as the contact person for the afghan government as well as for the united nations and other aid organizations .
riechmann is also expected to keep in touch with the u.s. army , which , though not involved in the peacekeeping exercises , is still engaged in combat in afghanistan .
furthermore , the bundeswehr is responsible for security at the international airport in kabul , where riots and skirmishes have taken place in the past .
mission fraught with dangers security is the main issue as the 2,500 bundeswehr soldiers on the ground will have to cope with an unsafe environment .
strict security precautions were taken for the ceremony on monday .
the german foreign intelligence service had warned of possible attacks on the german camp and german soldiers before the isaf leadership handover .
the missile attack near the german camp in kabul on monday is only the most recent in a series of incidents .
in january three missiles struck near the german camp , though no one was injured .
in december , seven bundeswehr and two dutch soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash caused by machine failure .
before struck ’ s departure for kabul he announced there were indications of increased terrorist activities by armed taliban fighters and followers of the fundamentalist military leader , gulbuddin hekmatyar .
sceptical of extension the afghan government would like to see isaf ’ s area of responsibilities extended beyond kabul and vicinity , an idea that the united states is said to be considering .
but germany maintains that it does not have the capacity to enlarge its area of responsibility .
" that ’ s definitely a question of how much manpower we have , " general riechmann told dw-radio .
" we germans would not be in a position to undertake such a mission , and even the other nations couldn ’ t .
that ’ s why i think that the principle of building a ‘ safe haven ’ in kabul as a source from which to develop a new law and order system is the best way .

as germany 's negotiator for the icc , kaul has been a strong advocate for an independent court . hans-peter kaul will be the one german among 18 judges to be sworn in by queen beatrix of the netherlands on march 11 to preside at the world 's first permanent criminal court .
kaul was elected to the position on friday at united nations headquarters in new york .
he received 57 out of a possible 85 votes .
the 59-year-old career diplomat and expert in humanitarian law has helped shape the icc on the behalf of germany .
he has been a long-time supporter of the idea of the tribunal as a venu to try individuals before a court of law for crimes against humanity that states are unwilling or unable to try themselves .
diplomat lawyer born in 1943 , kaul completed his first law degree in heidelberg in 1971 before going on to study in cambridge , paris and the hague .
he then returned to heidelberg , where he passed his bar exam in 1975 .
although trained as a jurist , kaul entered the diplomatic corps shortly after completing his studies , serving in consulates in norway , tel aviv and washington before becoming first counselor at germany 's mission to the united nations in 1993 .
kaul has worked toward the establishment of the court since 1996 , when he was involved with preparations leading up to the rome statute , the 1998 agreement that sets out the court 's jurisdiction , structure and functions .
he remained head of germany 's office for public international law even as the government changed hands in 1998 , much to the delight of nongovernmental organizations involved in the icc project , since many saw in kaul an engaged and cooperative partner who consistently worked toward designing an effective , independent and workable court .
in 2002 , kaul accepted an appointment as the head of the foreign office 's commission for the icc .
the jurist is married with four children and speaks german , english , french and norwegian .
his tenure in the hague is expected to last three years .
modelled on nuremberg the international criminal court is based on principles of the tribunals set up at the end of wwii to try german and japanese leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
a total of 139 countries have signed the treaty creating the court , with 88 ratifying it so far .
although the newly elected judges , eleven men and seven women , will be sworn in in march , the key task of naming a prosecutor will not begin until april 21 .
a fully functioning staff is not expected to be in place until the end of summer .
when the court does begin operations , its task will be to try some of the world 's most egregious crimes , such as mass murder , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it will only be able to try cases for crimes that were committed after july 1 , 2002 .
one notable absence from the icc 's list of supporters is the united states , which has never been very comfortable with the idea behind the international body , even under the clinton administration .

germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq . in a decision that could shake the north atlantic treaty organization , france and belgium vetoed efforts on monday to prepare to give turkey military support in the event that the alliance member came under attack during a u.s.-led war against iraq , sources said .
the move came with explicit support of the german government .
in response to the veto , turkey plans to demand that the alliance reconsider the issue on monday , the turkish television station ntv reported .
the turkish government plans to cite an article in the north atlantic treaty that established the alliance in 1949 .
" the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened , " the article says . the veto by france and belgium did not come as a surprise .
on thursday , the alliance put off a decision on the issue because of the disagreement .
at the time , nato secretary general george robertson said : " where there has been a disagreement is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan . "
belgium and france raise objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's foreign minister louis michel the decision to delay a decision was followed by statements sunday from belgian foreign minister louis michel that his country would block the matter and from france that it might do likewise .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive three forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance , patriot missiles to provide air defense , and special forces to combat biological and chemical weapons .
the request is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
the issue becomes complicated for germany because its servicemembers serve in the surveillance planes .
if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they should remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
concerns of the u.s. the issue is also sensitive to the united states .
at a security conference held in munich over the weekend , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the dispute could endanger the alliance .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that -lrb- veteoing the plan -rrb- .
it is beyond my comprehension . ...
turkey is an ally .

germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq . in a decision that could shake the north atlantic treaty organization , france and belgium vetoed efforts on monday to prepare to give turkey military support in the event that the alliance member came under attack during a u.s.-led war against iraq , sources said .
the move came with explicit support of the german government .
in response to the veto , turkey plans to demand that the alliance reconsider the issue on monday , the turkish television station ntv reported .
the turkish government plans to cite an article in the north atlantic treaty that established the alliance in 1949 .
" the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened , " the article says . the veto by france and belgium did not come as a surprise .
on thursday , the alliance put off a decision on the issue because of the disagreement .
at the time , nato secretary general george robertson said : " where there has been a disagreement is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan . "
belgium and france raise objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's foreign minister louis michel the decision to delay a decision was followed by statements sunday from belgian foreign minister louis michel that his country would block the matter and from france that it might do likewise .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive three forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance , patriot missiles to provide air defense , and special forces to combat biological and chemical weapons .
the request is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
the issue becomes complicated for germany because its servicemembers serve in the surveillance planes .
if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they should remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
concerns of the u.s. the issue is also sensitive to the united states .
at a security conference held in munich over the weekend , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the dispute could endanger the alliance .

as germany 's negotiator for the icc , kaul has been a strong advocate for an independent court . hans-peter kaul will be the one german among 18 judges to be sworn in by queen beatrix of the netherlands on march 11 to preside at the world 's first permanent criminal court .
kaul was elected to the position on friday at united nations headquarters in new york .
he received 57 out of a possible 85 votes .
the 59-year-old career diplomat and expert in humanitarian law has helped shape the icc on the behalf of germany .
he has been a long-time supporter of the idea of the tribunal as a venu to try individuals before a court of law for crimes against humanity that states are unwilling or unable to try themselves .
diplomat lawyer born in 1943 , kaul completed his first law degree in heidelberg in 1971 before going on to study in cambridge , paris and the hague .
he then returned to heidelberg , where he passed his bar exam in 1975 .
although trained as a jurist , kaul entered the diplomatic corps shortly after completing his studies , serving in consulates in norway , tel aviv and washington before becoming first counselor at germany 's mission to the united nations in 1993 .
kaul has worked toward the establishment of the court since 1996 , when he was involved with preparations leading up to the rome statute , the 1998 agreement that sets out the court 's jurisdiction , structure and functions .
he remained head of germany 's office for public international law even as the government changed hands in 1998 , much to the delight of nongovernmental organizations involved in the icc project , since many saw in kaul an engaged and cooperative partner who consistently worked toward designing an effective , independent and workable court .
in 2002 , kaul accepted an appointment as the head of the foreign office 's commission for the icc .
the jurist is married with four children and speaks german , english , french and norwegian .
his tenure in the hague is expected to last three years .
modelled on nuremberg the international criminal court is based on principles of the tribunals set up at the end of wwii to try german and japanese leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
a total of 139 countries have signed the treaty creating the court , with 88 ratifying it so far .
although the newly elected judges , eleven men and seven women , will be sworn in in march , the key task of naming a prosecutor will not begin until april 21 .
a fully functioning staff is not expected to be in place until the end of summer .
when the court does begin operations , its task will be to try some of the world 's most egregious crimes , such as mass murder , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it will only be able to try cases for crimes that were committed after july 1 , 2002 .
one notable absence from the icc 's list of supporters is the united states , which has never been very comfortable with the idea behind the international body , even under the clinton administration .
george w. bush has spurned the court , withdrawing his predecessor 's signature from the treaty and arguing that the court could be used for political ends , with malicious prosecutors bringing charges against u.s. peacekeepers or soldiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive three forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance , patriot missiles to provide air defense , and special forces to combat biological and chemical weapons .
the request is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
the issue becomes complicated for germany because its servicemembers serve in the surveillance planes .
if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they should remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
concerns of the u.s. the issue is also sensitive to the united states .
at a security conference held in munich over the weekend , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the dispute could endanger the alliance .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that -lrb- veteoing the plan -rrb- .
it is beyond my comprehension . ...
turkey is an ally .
the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .

germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq . in a decision that could shake the north atlantic treaty organization , france and belgium vetoed efforts on monday to prepare to give turkey military support in the event that the alliance member came under attack during a u.s.-led war against iraq , sources said .
the move came with explicit support of the german government .
in response to the veto , turkey plans to demand that the alliance reconsider the issue on monday , the turkish television station ntv reported .
the turkish government plans to cite an article in the north atlantic treaty that established the alliance in 1949 .
" the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened , " the article says . the veto by france and belgium did not come as a surprise .
on thursday , the alliance put off a decision on the issue because of the disagreement .
at the time , nato secretary general george robertson said : " where there has been a disagreement is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan . "

as germany 's negotiator for the icc , kaul has been a strong advocate for an independent court . hans-peter kaul will be the one german among 18 judges to be sworn in by queen beatrix of the netherlands on march 11 to preside at the world 's first permanent criminal court .
kaul was elected to the position on friday at united nations headquarters in new york .
he received 57 out of a possible 85 votes .
the 59-year-old career diplomat and expert in humanitarian law has helped shape the icc on the behalf of germany .
he has been a long-time supporter of the idea of the tribunal as a venu to try individuals before a court of law for crimes against humanity that states are unwilling or unable to try themselves .
diplomat lawyer born in 1943 , kaul completed his first law degree in heidelberg in 1971 before going on to study in cambridge , paris and the hague .
he then returned to heidelberg , where he passed his bar exam in 1975 .
although trained as a jurist , kaul entered the diplomatic corps shortly after completing his studies , serving in consulates in norway , tel aviv and washington before becoming first counselor at germany 's mission to the united nations in 1993 .
kaul has worked toward the establishment of the court since 1996 , when he was involved with preparations leading up to the rome statute , the 1998 agreement that sets out the court 's jurisdiction , structure and functions .
he remained head of germany 's office for public international law even as the government changed hands in 1998 , much to the delight of nongovernmental organizations involved in the icc project , since many saw in kaul an engaged and cooperative partner who consistently worked toward designing an effective , independent and workable court .
in 2002 , kaul accepted an appointment as the head of the foreign office 's commission for the icc .
the jurist is married with four children and speaks german , english , french and norwegian .
his tenure in the hague is expected to last three years .
modelled on nuremberg the international criminal court is based on principles of the tribunals set up at the end of wwii to try german and japanese leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
a total of 139 countries have signed the treaty creating the court , with 88 ratifying it so far .
although the newly elected judges , eleven men and seven women , will be sworn in in march , the key task of naming a prosecutor will not begin until april 21 .
a fully functioning staff is not expected to be in place until the end of summer .
when the court does begin operations , its task will be to try some of the world 's most egregious crimes , such as mass murder , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it will only be able to try cases for crimes that were committed after july 1 , 2002 .
one notable absence from the icc 's list of supporters is the united states , which has never been very comfortable with the idea behind the international body , even under the clinton administration .
george w. bush has spurned the court , withdrawing his predecessor 's signature from the treaty and arguing that the court could be used for political ends , with malicious prosecutors bringing charges against u.s. peacekeepers or soldiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a rocket attack near the german camp shortly after the hand-over ceremony emphasized the instability of the situation there . german defense minister peter struck 's visit to kabul on monday for the transfer of peacekeeping duties there from turkey to germany and the netherlands was interrupted by two missiles which exploded near the german camp in the afghan capital just hours after the handover .
while neither people nor property were damaged , the attack proved that comments struck had made earlier in the day were premature " i don ’ t see any reason to assume that the soldiers and i will be in danger , " the defense minister had said .
the two missiles struck around 500 meters -lrb- 500 yards -rrb- away from the german camp .
the german authorities in afghanistan are investigating the incident .
change at the helm of isaf germany and the netherlands have agreed to share responsibilities for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in and around kabul for the next six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck shortly before the hand-over in kabul struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he expects the foreign peacekeepers to leave afghanistan after the next afghan elections , scheduled for 2004 .
stabile structures will allow " the presence of foreign troops and the bundeswehr to be brought to an end , " the minister said .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer recently indicated that the bundeswehr could be in afghanistan much longer .
successor up in the air it is still unclear who will take isaf ’ s reigns over after the germans and dutch finish their tour .
struck said that the bundeswehr would remain in the country until september at the latest .
on monday he conferred with afghan president hamid karsai about the issue , suggesting that nato could assume the leadership of isaf in autumn 2003 .
after their meeting karsai announced that afghanistan would be happy with anyone .
struck later announced that he and his dutch counterpart , henk kamp , will discuss the issue with nato .
mission wo n't be easy during the handover ceremony defense minister struck affirmed that the mission in afghanistan is the greatest challenge the bundeswehr has yet faced .
while the germans have already committed 1,400 soldiers to the peacekeeping operation , 1,100 more will be added to the mission under german-dutch leadership .
the netherlands has sent 700 soldiers to support the undertaking .

general norbert van heyst -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has until now led the german-dutch corps in münster , is isaf ’ s new commander .
the german troops are headed by general friedrich riechmann , the commander of the german deployment in potsdam .
" our military capabilities are limited , " general riechmann told dw-radio .
after all some 10,000 bundeswehr soldiers are involved in peacekeeping operations all over the world at present .
that ’ s why we ’ re happy that the dutch were prepared to take over part of the responsibility .
that ’ s one of the most important prerequisites .
we couldn ’ t have shouldered the responsibility alone , " he said .
complex responsibilities general riechmann will lead the troops , which come from 30 nations , while acting as the contact person for the afghan government as well as for the united nations and other aid organizations .
riechmann is also expected to keep in touch with the u.s. army , which , though not involved in the peacekeeping exercises , is still engaged in combat in afghanistan .
furthermore , the bundeswehr is responsible for security at the international airport in kabul , where riots and skirmishes have taken place in the past .
mission fraught with dangers security is the main issue as the 2,500 bundeswehr soldiers on the ground will have to cope with an unsafe environment .
strict security precautions were taken for the ceremony on monday .
the german foreign intelligence service had warned of possible attacks on the german camp and german soldiers before the isaf leadership handover .
the missile attack near the german camp in kabul on monday is only the most recent in a series of incidents .
in january three missiles struck near the german camp , though no one was injured .
in december , seven bundeswehr and two dutch soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash caused by machine failure .
before struck ’ s departure for kabul he announced there were indications of increased terrorist activities by armed taliban fighters and followers of the fundamentalist military leader , gulbuddin hekmatyar .
sceptical of extension the afghan government would like to see isaf ’ s area of responsibilities extended beyond kabul and vicinity , an idea that the united states is said to be considering .
but germany maintains that it does not have the capacity to enlarge its area of responsibility .
" that ’ s definitely a question of how much manpower we have , " general riechmann told dw-radio .
" we germans would not be in a position to undertake such a mission , and even the other nations couldn ’ t .

as germany 's negotiator for the icc , kaul has been a strong advocate for an independent court . hans-peter kaul will be the one german among 18 judges to be sworn in by queen beatrix of the netherlands on march 11 to preside at the world 's first permanent criminal court .
kaul was elected to the position on friday at united nations headquarters in new york .
he received 57 out of a possible 85 votes .
the 59-year-old career diplomat and expert in humanitarian law has helped shape the icc on the behalf of germany .
he has been a long-time supporter of the idea of the tribunal as a venu to try individuals before a court of law for crimes against humanity that states are unwilling or unable to try themselves .
diplomat lawyer born in 1943 , kaul completed his first law degree in heidelberg in 1971 before going on to study in cambridge , paris and the hague .
he then returned to heidelberg , where he passed his bar exam in 1975 .
although trained as a jurist , kaul entered the diplomatic corps shortly after completing his studies , serving in consulates in norway , tel aviv and washington before becoming first counselor at germany 's mission to the united nations in 1993 .
kaul has worked toward the establishment of the court since 1996 , when he was involved with preparations leading up to the rome statute , the 1998 agreement that sets out the court 's jurisdiction , structure and functions .
he remained head of germany 's office for public international law even as the government changed hands in 1998 , much to the delight of nongovernmental organizations involved in the icc project , since many saw in kaul an engaged and cooperative partner who consistently worked toward designing an effective , independent and workable court .
in 2002 , kaul accepted an appointment as the head of the foreign office 's commission for the icc .
the jurist is married with four children and speaks german , english , french and norwegian .
his tenure in the hague is expected to last three years .
modelled on nuremberg the international criminal court is based on principles of the tribunals set up at the end of wwii to try german and japanese leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
a total of 139 countries have signed the treaty creating the court , with 88 ratifying it so far .
although the newly elected judges , eleven men and seven women , will be sworn in in march , the key task of naming a prosecutor will not begin until april 21 .
a fully functioning staff is not expected to be in place until the end of summer .
when the court does begin operations , its task will be to try some of the world 's most egregious crimes , such as mass murder , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it will only be able to try cases for crimes that were committed after july 1 , 2002 .

a rocket attack near the german camp shortly after the hand-over ceremony emphasized the instability of the situation there . german defense minister peter struck 's visit to kabul on monday for the transfer of peacekeeping duties there from turkey to germany and the netherlands was interrupted by two missiles which exploded near the german camp in the afghan capital just hours after the handover .
while neither people nor property were damaged , the attack proved that comments struck had made earlier in the day were premature " i don ’ t see any reason to assume that the soldiers and i will be in danger , " the defense minister had said .
the two missiles struck around 500 meters -lrb- 500 yards -rrb- away from the german camp .
the german authorities in afghanistan are investigating the incident .
change at the helm of isaf germany and the netherlands have agreed to share responsibilities for the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in and around kabul for the next six months .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister peter struck shortly before the hand-over in kabul struck -lrb- photo -rrb- said that he expects the foreign peacekeepers to leave afghanistan after the next afghan elections , scheduled for 2004 .
stabile structures will allow " the presence of foreign troops and the bundeswehr to be brought to an end , " the minister said .
however , german foreign minister joschka fischer recently indicated that the bundeswehr could be in afghanistan much longer .
successor up in the air it is still unclear who will take isaf ’ s reigns over after the germans and dutch finish their tour .
struck said that the bundeswehr would remain in the country until september at the latest .
on monday he conferred with afghan president hamid karsai about the issue , suggesting that nato could assume the leadership of isaf in autumn 2003 .
after their meeting karsai announced that afghanistan would be happy with anyone .
struck later announced that he and his dutch counterpart , henk kamp , will discuss the issue with nato .
mission wo n't be easy during the handover ceremony defense minister struck affirmed that the mission in afghanistan is the greatest challenge the bundeswehr has yet faced .
while the germans have already committed 1,400 soldiers to the peacekeeping operation , 1,100 more will be added to the mission under german-dutch leadership .
the netherlands has sent 700 soldiers to support the undertaking .

general norbert van heyst -lrb- photo -rrb- , who has until now led the german-dutch corps in münster , is isaf ’ s new commander .
the german troops are headed by general friedrich riechmann , the commander of the german deployment in potsdam .
" our military capabilities are limited , " general riechmann told dw-radio .
after all some 10,000 bundeswehr soldiers are involved in peacekeeping operations all over the world at present .
that ’ s why we ’ re happy that the dutch were prepared to take over part of the responsibility .
that ’ s one of the most important prerequisites .
we couldn ’ t have shouldered the responsibility alone , " he said .
complex responsibilities general riechmann will lead the troops , which come from 30 nations , while acting as the contact person for the afghan government as well as for the united nations and other aid organizations .
riechmann is also expected to keep in touch with the u.s. army , which , though not involved in the peacekeeping exercises , is still engaged in combat in afghanistan .
furthermore , the bundeswehr is responsible for security at the international airport in kabul , where riots and skirmishes have taken place in the past .
mission fraught with dangers security is the main issue as the 2,500 bundeswehr soldiers on the ground will have to cope with an unsafe environment .
strict security precautions were taken for the ceremony on monday .
the german foreign intelligence service had warned of possible attacks on the german camp and german soldiers before the isaf leadership handover .
the missile attack near the german camp in kabul on monday is only the most recent in a series of incidents .
in january three missiles struck near the german camp , though no one was injured .
in december , seven bundeswehr and two dutch soldiers were killed in a helicopter crash caused by machine failure .
before struck ’ s departure for kabul he announced there were indications of increased terrorist activities by armed taliban fighters and followers of the fundamentalist military leader , gulbuddin hekmatyar .
sceptical of extension the afghan government would like to see isaf ’ s area of responsibilities extended beyond kabul and vicinity , an idea that the united states is said to be considering .
but germany maintains that it does not have the capacity to enlarge its area of responsibility .
" that ’ s definitely a question of how much manpower we have , " general riechmann told dw-radio .
" we germans would not be in a position to undertake such a mission , and even the other nations couldn ’ t .
that ’ s why i think that the principle of building a ‘ safe haven ’ in kabul as a source from which to develop a new law and order system is the best way .

by the midway point of the second half , the germans were back in the ascendance .
gude scored her second goal of the match and effectively put the game beyond the reach of the dutch , who responded by sending their keeper into open play and attacking the germans with six field players .

" my team played well and they deserve a huge compliment , " said german coach peter lemmen after the victory .
" it will take a few years for other countries to reach our standard . "

" they fit together like laurel and hardy , " he said .

as germany 's negotiator for the icc , kaul has been a strong advocate for an independent court . hans-peter kaul will be the one german among 18 judges to be sworn in by queen beatrix of the netherlands on march 11 to preside at the world 's first permanent criminal court .
kaul was elected to the position on friday at united nations headquarters in new york .
he received 57 out of a possible 85 votes .
the 59-year-old career diplomat and expert in humanitarian law has helped shape the icc on the behalf of germany .
he has been a long-time supporter of the idea of the tribunal as a venu to try individuals before a court of law for crimes against humanity that states are unwilling or unable to try themselves .
diplomat lawyer born in 1943 , kaul completed his first law degree in heidelberg in 1971 before going on to study in cambridge , paris and the hague .
he then returned to heidelberg , where he passed his bar exam in 1975 .
although trained as a jurist , kaul entered the diplomatic corps shortly after completing his studies , serving in consulates in norway , tel aviv and washington before becoming first counselor at germany 's mission to the united nations in 1993 .
kaul has worked toward the establishment of the court since 1996 , when he was involved with preparations leading up to the rome statute , the 1998 agreement that sets out the court 's jurisdiction , structure and functions .
he remained head of germany 's office for public international law even as the government changed hands in 1998 , much to the delight of nongovernmental organizations involved in the icc project , since many saw in kaul an engaged and cooperative partner who consistently worked toward designing an effective , independent and workable court .
in 2002 , kaul accepted an appointment as the head of the foreign office 's commission for the icc .
the jurist is married with four children and speaks german , english , french and norwegian .
his tenure in the hague is expected to last three years .
modelled on nuremberg the international criminal court is based on principles of the tribunals set up at the end of wwii to try german and japanese leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
a total of 139 countries have signed the treaty creating the court , with 88 ratifying it so far .
although the newly elected judges , eleven men and seven women , will be sworn in in march , the key task of naming a prosecutor will not begin until april 21 .
a fully functioning staff is not expected to be in place until the end of summer .
when the court does begin operations , its task will be to try some of the world 's most egregious crimes , such as mass murder , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it will only be able to try cases for crimes that were committed after july 1 , 2002 .
one notable absence from the icc 's list of supporters is the united states , which has never been very comfortable with the idea behind the international body , even under the clinton administration .
george w. bush has spurned the court , withdrawing his predecessor 's signature from the treaty and arguing that the court could be used for political ends , with malicious prosecutors bringing charges against u.s. peacekeepers or soldiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

oliver domke , who scored germany 's winner against australia in last year 's outdoor world cup in malaysia , got his second point of the game four minutes after the restart .
the germans eventually romped home to a 7-1 victory to take the first men 's indoor world title in style .
women overcome resilient dutch earlier on sunday , the german women 's team struggled against the team from the netherlands but eventually secured the championship winning 5-2 , a score that belies the close nature of the contest .
germany played well in the first half and led 3-0 after 17 minutes through goals by franci gude , anneke böhmert and natasha keller .
the dutch replied with two goals by marianne van greenhuizen which pinned the germans back as halftime approached .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german natascha keller -lrb- front -rrb- .
by the midway point of the second half , the germans were back in the ascendance .
gude scored her second goal of the match and effectively put the game beyond the reach of the dutch , who responded by sending their keeper into open play and attacking the germans with six field players .
the plan backfired and the germans took full advantage of the gaping defense with keller , who ended the tournament 's top scorer with 24 goals , breaking free to score her side 's fifth .
" my team played well and they deserve a huge compliment , " said german coach peter lemmen after the victory .
" it will take a few years for other countries to reach our standard . "
coach praises ' laurel and hardy ' lemmen , who is in his second year as coach of the team , said he was particularly impressed with the way keller and gude combined , although some might question his choice of analogy given their cohesive play .
" they fit together like laurel and hardy , " he said .
france finished third in both the women 's and the men 's competition .

germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq . in a decision that could shake the north atlantic treaty organization , france and belgium vetoed efforts on monday to prepare to give turkey military support in the event that the alliance member came under attack during a u.s.-led war against iraq , sources said .
the move came with explicit support of the german government .
in response to the veto , turkey plans to demand that the alliance reconsider the issue on monday , the turkish television station ntv reported .
the turkish government plans to cite an article in the north atlantic treaty that established the alliance in 1949 .
" the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened , " the article says . the veto by france and belgium did not come as a surprise .
on thursday , the alliance put off a decision on the issue because of the disagreement .
at the time , nato secretary general george robertson said : " where there has been a disagreement is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan . "
belgium and france raise objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's foreign minister louis michel the decision to delay a decision was followed by statements sunday from belgian foreign minister louis michel that his country would block the matter and from france that it might do likewise .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive three forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance , patriot missiles to provide air defense , and special forces to combat biological and chemical weapons .
the request is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
the issue becomes complicated for germany because its servicemembers serve in the surveillance planes .
if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they should remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
concerns of the u.s. the issue is also sensitive to the united states .
at a security conference held in munich over the weekend , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the dispute could endanger the alliance .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that -lrb- veteoing the plan -rrb- .
it is beyond my comprehension . ...
turkey is an ally .
the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld said saturday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq . in a decision that could shake the north atlantic treaty organization , france and belgium vetoed efforts on monday to prepare to give turkey military support in the event that the alliance member came under attack during a u.s.-led war against iraq , sources said .
the move came with explicit support of the german government .
in response to the veto , turkey plans to demand that the alliance reconsider the issue on monday , the turkish television station ntv reported .
the turkish government plans to cite an article in the north atlantic treaty that established the alliance in 1949 .
" the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened , " the article says . the veto by france and belgium did not come as a surprise .
on thursday , the alliance put off a decision on the issue because of the disagreement .
at the time , nato secretary general george robertson said : " where there has been a disagreement is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan . "
belgium and france raise objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's foreign minister louis michel the decision to delay a decision was followed by statements sunday from belgian foreign minister louis michel that his country would block the matter and from france that it might do likewise .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive three forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance , patriot missiles to provide air defense , and special forces to combat biological and chemical weapons .
the request is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
the issue becomes complicated for germany because its servicemembers serve in the surveillance planes .
if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they should remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
concerns of the u.s. the issue is also sensitive to the united states .
at a security conference held in munich over the weekend , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the dispute could endanger the alliance .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that -lrb- veteoing the plan -rrb- .
it is beyond my comprehension . ...

financial experts at the german stock exchange are due to discuss the expansion of the equity market and the implementation of the new tecdax technology sector index model at a meeting on tuesday . experts at the deutsche börse , the german stock exchange , will meet on february 11 in frankfurt to discuss the final arrangements on the expansion of the country 's financial market .
while the original dax index will remain unchanged and continuing to host germany 's 30 largest blue chip companies , the new developments are set to expand the equity market with a new index model that aims to showcase technology companies the model , to be known as tecdax , is based on a plan that was approved in principle by the exchange council of the frankfurt stock exchange last year .
members of deutsche börse ag , the company that runs the stock exchange , are due to discuss the proposal of introducing the tecdax to the current market system on tuesday .
if the integration is agreed upon , the new indices will be launched on march 24 .
tecdax to showcase technology companies the tecdax , which will track the 30 largest equities , will offer companies from the technology sectors greater exposure and it is hoped it will contribute to an economic recovery for germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche börse volker potthoff , the deutsche börse executive board member responsible for the cash market , said in an official press release : " the new index completes the new equity market segmentation with which we are creating the highest transparency standards in europe and thus making investors the focus of market organization . "
current nemax index will offer support once the tecdax is up and running , a parallel calculation of the nemax 50 , the current index for the 50 largest equities in the technology sectors , is expected to continue until the end of 2004 , in order to maintain continuity for financial products already based on this index .
while the dax will be unchanged , deutsche börse will differentiate between those companies below the dax .
for the companies from classic sectors , it will calculate the mdax index , a senior index of companies , which is being reduced from 70 to 50 equities .
the sdax will continue to comprise 50 equities as the selection index for smaller firms ranked immediately below the mdax .
skepticism from financial professionals professionals from the financial sector are skeptical about the new tecdax market and its worth .
" i can hardly believe that this new market index sector will bring a real change , " said eberhard weinberger from analysts dr. jens erhard kapital ag .
" first , you must develop better frameworks in germany , then that will be the time for big decisions . "

germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq . in a decision that could shake the north atlantic treaty organization , france and belgium vetoed efforts on monday to prepare to give turkey military support in the event that the alliance member came under attack during a u.s.-led war against iraq , sources said .
the move came with explicit support of the german government .
in response to the veto , turkey plans to demand that the alliance reconsider the issue on monday , the turkish television station ntv reported .
the turkish government plans to cite an article in the north atlantic treaty that established the alliance in 1949 .
" the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened , " the article says . the veto by france and belgium did not come as a surprise .
on thursday , the alliance put off a decision on the issue because of the disagreement .
at the time , nato secretary general george robertson said : " where there has been a disagreement is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan . "
belgium and france raise objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's foreign minister louis michel the decision to delay a decision was followed by statements sunday from belgian foreign minister louis michel that his country would block the matter and from france that it might do likewise .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive three forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance , patriot missiles to provide air defense , and special forces to combat biological and chemical weapons .
the request is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
the issue becomes complicated for germany because its servicemembers serve in the surveillance planes .
if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they should remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
concerns of the u.s. the issue is also sensitive to the united states .
at a security conference held in munich over the weekend , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the dispute could endanger the alliance .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that -lrb- veteoing the plan -rrb- .
it is beyond my comprehension . ...
turkey is an ally .
the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .

as germany 's negotiator for the icc , kaul has been a strong advocate for an independent court . hans-peter kaul will be the one german among 18 judges to be sworn in by queen beatrix of the netherlands on march 11 to preside at the world 's first permanent criminal court .
kaul was elected to the position on friday at united nations headquarters in new york .
he received 57 out of a possible 85 votes .
the 59-year-old career diplomat and expert in humanitarian law has helped shape the icc on the behalf of germany .
he has been a long-time supporter of the idea of the tribunal as a venu to try individuals before a court of law for crimes against humanity that states are unwilling or unable to try themselves .
diplomat lawyer born in 1943 , kaul completed his first law degree in heidelberg in 1971 before going on to study in cambridge , paris and the hague .
he then returned to heidelberg , where he passed his bar exam in 1975 .
although trained as a jurist , kaul entered the diplomatic corps shortly after completing his studies , serving in consulates in norway , tel aviv and washington before becoming first counselor at germany 's mission to the united nations in 1993 .
kaul has worked toward the establishment of the court since 1996 , when he was involved with preparations leading up to the rome statute , the 1998 agreement that sets out the court 's jurisdiction , structure and functions .
he remained head of germany 's office for public international law even as the government changed hands in 1998 , much to the delight of nongovernmental organizations involved in the icc project , since many saw in kaul an engaged and cooperative partner who consistently worked toward designing an effective , independent and workable court .
in 2002 , kaul accepted an appointment as the head of the foreign office 's commission for the icc .
the jurist is married with four children and speaks german , english , french and norwegian .
his tenure in the hague is expected to last three years .
modelled on nuremberg the international criminal court is based on principles of the tribunals set up at the end of wwii to try german and japanese leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
a total of 139 countries have signed the treaty creating the court , with 88 ratifying it so far .
although the newly elected judges , eleven men and seven women , will be sworn in in march , the key task of naming a prosecutor will not begin until april 21 .
a fully functioning staff is not expected to be in place until the end of summer .
when the court does begin operations , its task will be to try some of the world 's most egregious crimes , such as mass murder , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it will only be able to try cases for crimes that were committed after july 1 , 2002 .
one notable absence from the icc 's list of supporters is the united states , which has never been very comfortable with the idea behind the international body , even under the clinton administration .
george w. bush has spurned the court , withdrawing his predecessor 's signature from the treaty and arguing that the court could be used for political ends , with malicious prosecutors bringing charges against u.s. peacekeepers or soldiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq . in a decision that could shake the north atlantic treaty organization , france and belgium vetoed efforts on monday to prepare to give turkey military support in the event that the alliance member came under attack during a u.s.-led war against iraq , sources said .
the move came with explicit support of the german government .
in response to the veto , turkey plans to demand that the alliance reconsider the issue on monday , the turkish television station ntv reported .
the turkish government plans to cite an article in the north atlantic treaty that established the alliance in 1949 .
" the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened , " the article says . the veto by france and belgium did not come as a surprise .
on thursday , the alliance put off a decision on the issue because of the disagreement .
at the time , nato secretary general george robertson said : " where there has been a disagreement is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan . "
belgium and france raise objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's foreign minister louis michel the decision to delay a decision was followed by statements sunday from belgian foreign minister louis michel that his country would block the matter and from france that it might do likewise .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive three forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance , patriot missiles to provide air defense , and special forces to combat biological and chemical weapons .
the request is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
the issue becomes complicated for germany because its servicemembers serve in the surveillance planes .
if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they should remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
concerns of the u.s. the issue is also sensitive to the united states .
at a security conference held in munich over the weekend , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the dispute could endanger the alliance .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that -lrb- veteoing the plan -rrb- .
it is beyond my comprehension . ...
turkey is an ally .
the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld said saturday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

as germany 's negotiator for the icc , kaul has been a strong advocate for an independent court . hans-peter kaul will be the one german among 18 judges to be sworn in by queen beatrix of the netherlands on march 11 to preside at the world 's first permanent criminal court .
kaul was elected to the position on friday at united nations headquarters in new york .
he received 57 out of a possible 85 votes .
the 59-year-old career diplomat and expert in humanitarian law has helped shape the icc on the behalf of germany .
he has been a long-time supporter of the idea of the tribunal as a venu to try individuals before a court of law for crimes against humanity that states are unwilling or unable to try themselves .
diplomat lawyer born in 1943 , kaul completed his first law degree in heidelberg in 1971 before going on to study in cambridge , paris and the hague .
he then returned to heidelberg , where he passed his bar exam in 1975 .
although trained as a jurist , kaul entered the diplomatic corps shortly after completing his studies , serving in consulates in norway , tel aviv and washington before becoming first counselor at germany 's mission to the united nations in 1993 .
kaul has worked toward the establishment of the court since 1996 , when he was involved with preparations leading up to the rome statute , the 1998 agreement that sets out the court 's jurisdiction , structure and functions .
he remained head of germany 's office for public international law even as the government changed hands in 1998 , much to the delight of nongovernmental organizations involved in the icc project , since many saw in kaul an engaged and cooperative partner who consistently worked toward designing an effective , independent and workable court .
in 2002 , kaul accepted an appointment as the head of the foreign office 's commission for the icc .
the jurist is married with four children and speaks german , english , french and norwegian .
his tenure in the hague is expected to last three years .

a total of 139 countries have signed the treaty creating the court , with 88 ratifying it so far .
although the newly elected judges , eleven men and seven women , will be sworn in in march , the key task of naming a prosecutor will not begin until april 21 .
a fully functioning staff is not expected to be in place until the end of summer .

as germany 's negotiator for the icc , kaul has been a strong advocate for an independent court . hans-peter kaul will be the one german among 18 judges to be sworn in by queen beatrix of the netherlands on march 11 to preside at the world 's first permanent criminal court .
kaul was elected to the position on friday at united nations headquarters in new york .
he received 57 out of a possible 85 votes .
the 59-year-old career diplomat and expert in humanitarian law has helped shape the icc on the behalf of germany .
he has been a long-time supporter of the idea of the tribunal as a venu to try individuals before a court of law for crimes against humanity that states are unwilling or unable to try themselves .
diplomat lawyer born in 1943 , kaul completed his first law degree in heidelberg in 1971 before going on to study in cambridge , paris and the hague .
he then returned to heidelberg , where he passed his bar exam in 1975 .
although trained as a jurist , kaul entered the diplomatic corps shortly after completing his studies , serving in consulates in norway , tel aviv and washington before becoming first counselor at germany 's mission to the united nations in 1993 .
kaul has worked toward the establishment of the court since 1996 , when he was involved with preparations leading up to the rome statute , the 1998 agreement that sets out the court 's jurisdiction , structure and functions .
he remained head of germany 's office for public international law even as the government changed hands in 1998 , much to the delight of nongovernmental organizations involved in the icc project , since many saw in kaul an engaged and cooperative partner who consistently worked toward designing an effective , independent and workable court .
in 2002 , kaul accepted an appointment as the head of the foreign office 's commission for the icc .
the jurist is married with four children and speaks german , english , french and norwegian .
his tenure in the hague is expected to last three years .
modelled on nuremberg the international criminal court is based on principles of the tribunals set up at the end of wwii to try german and japanese leaders accused of gross violations of human rights .
a total of 139 countries have signed the treaty creating the court , with 88 ratifying it so far .
although the newly elected judges , eleven men and seven women , will be sworn in in march , the key task of naming a prosecutor will not begin until april 21 .
a fully functioning staff is not expected to be in place until the end of summer .
when the court does begin operations , its task will be to try some of the world 's most egregious crimes , such as mass murder , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
it will only be able to try cases for crimes that were committed after july 1 , 2002 .
one notable absence from the icc 's list of supporters is the united states , which has never been very comfortable with the idea behind the international body , even under the clinton administration .
george w. bush has spurned the court , withdrawing his predecessor 's signature from the treaty and arguing that the court could be used for political ends , with malicious prosecutors bringing charges against u.s. peacekeepers or soldiers . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

oliver domke , who scored germany 's winner against australia in last year 's outdoor world cup in malaysia , got his second point of the game four minutes after the restart .

oliver domke , who scored germany 's winner against australia in last year 's outdoor world cup in malaysia , got his second point of the game four minutes after the restart .
the germans eventually romped home to a 7-1 victory to take the first men 's indoor world title in style .
women overcome resilient dutch earlier on sunday , the german women 's team struggled against the team from the netherlands but eventually secured the championship winning 5-2 , a score that belies the close nature of the contest .
germany played well in the first half and led 3-0 after 17 minutes through goals by franci gude , anneke böhmert and natasha keller .
the dutch replied with two goals by marianne van greenhuizen which pinned the germans back as halftime approached .

by the midway point of the second half , the germans were back in the ascendance .
gude scored her second goal of the match and effectively put the game beyond the reach of the dutch , who responded by sending their keeper into open play and attacking the germans with six field players .
the plan backfired and the germans took full advantage of the gaping defense with keller , who ended the tournament 's top scorer with 24 goals , breaking free to score her side 's fifth .
" my team played well and they deserve a huge compliment , " said german coach peter lemmen after the victory .
" it will take a few years for other countries to reach our standard . "
coach praises ' laurel and hardy ' lemmen , who is in his second year as coach of the team , said he was particularly impressed with the way keller and gude combined , although some might question his choice of analogy given their cohesive play .
" they fit together like laurel and hardy , " he said .

germany endorses a move by france and belgium to veto a u.s. proposal to begin preparations for nato 's defense of turkey if war breaks out against neighboring iraq . in a decision that could shake the north atlantic treaty organization , france and belgium vetoed efforts on monday to prepare to give turkey military support in the event that the alliance member came under attack during a u.s.-led war against iraq , sources said .
the move came with explicit support of the german government .
in response to the veto , turkey plans to demand that the alliance reconsider the issue on monday , the turkish television station ntv reported .
the turkish government plans to cite an article in the north atlantic treaty that established the alliance in 1949 .
" the parties will consult together whenever , in the opinion of any of them , the territorial integrity , political independence or security of any of the parties is threatened , " the article says . the veto by france and belgium did not come as a surprise .
on thursday , the alliance put off a decision on the issue because of the disagreement .
at the time , nato secretary general george robertson said : " where there has been a disagreement is over when to formally task this military planning .
not whether to plan but when to plan . "
belgium and france raise objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's foreign minister louis michel the decision to delay a decision was followed by statements sunday from belgian foreign minister louis michel that his country would block the matter and from france that it might do likewise .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive three forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance , patriot missiles to provide air defense , and special forces to combat biological and chemical weapons .
the request is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
the issue becomes complicated for germany because its servicemembers serve in the surveillance planes .
if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they should remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
concerns of the u.s. the issue is also sensitive to the united states .
at a security conference held in munich over the weekend , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the dispute could endanger the alliance .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that -lrb- veteoing the plan -rrb- .
it is beyond my comprehension . ...
turkey is an ally .
the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .

belgium and france raise objections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belgium 's foreign minister louis michel the decision to delay a decision was followed by statements sunday from belgian foreign minister louis michel that his country would block the matter and from france that it might do likewise .
the issue has been simmering within the alliance since mid-january when the united states asked its other 18 nato allies for assistance .
the united states wants turkey , a neighbor of iraq , to receive three forms of help : airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft to provide surveillance , patriot missiles to provide air defense , and special forces to combat biological and chemical weapons .
the request is particularly sensitive for german chancellor gerhard schröder because he has said germany would not fight any war against iraq and would vote against any resolution that is presented in the u.n. security council to authorize such a war .
the issue becomes complicated for germany because its servicemembers serve in the surveillance planes .
if the alliance provided the planes to turkey , schröder would have to decide whether they should remain on board .
if they were pulled out , the alliance would have a difficult time carrying out the mission .
concerns of the u.s. the issue is also sensitive to the united states .
at a security conference held in munich over the weekend , u.s. secretary of defense donald rumsfeld said the dispute could endanger the alliance .
" i can ’ t imagine doing that -lrb- veteoing the plan -rrb- .
it is beyond my comprehension . ...
turkey is an ally .
the north atlantic treaty provides for this .
turkey is a member of the alliance .
to prevent defensive capabilities – just the planning , not even deployment – i think that is inexcusable , " rumsfeld said saturday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the men 's team briefly struggled against poland in their final , while the women labored against a tough dutch side to eventually come out triumphant .
german men romp to 7-1 victory the german men went ahead thanks to early goals by brothers christian and oliver domke while matthias witthaus , björn emmerling and björn michel added later strikes to give the germans a convincing 5-1 halftime lead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sticks at the ready !
oliver domke , who scored germany 's winner against australia in last year 's outdoor world cup in malaysia , got his second point of the game four minutes after the restart .
the germans eventually romped home to a 7-1 victory to take the first men 's indoor world title in style .
women overcome resilient dutch earlier on sunday , the german women 's team struggled against the team from the netherlands but eventually secured the championship winning 5-2 , a score that belies the close nature of the contest .
germany played well in the first half and led 3-0 after 17 minutes through goals by franci gude , anneke böhmert and natasha keller .
the dutch replied with two goals by marianne van greenhuizen which pinned the germans back as halftime approached .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german natascha keller -lrb- front -rrb- .
by the midway point of the second half , the germans were back in the ascendance .
gude scored her second goal of the match and effectively put the game beyond the reach of the dutch , who responded by sending their keeper into open play and attacking the germans with six field players .
the plan backfired and the germans took full advantage of the gaping defense with keller , who ended the tournament 's top scorer with 24 goals , breaking free to score her side 's fifth .
" my team played well and they deserve a huge compliment , " said german coach peter lemmen after the victory .
" it will take a few years for other countries to reach our standard . "
coach praises ' laurel and hardy ' lemmen , who is in his second year as coach of the team , said he was particularly impressed with the way keller and gude combined , although some might question his choice of analogy given their cohesive play .
" they fit together like laurel and hardy , " he said .
france finished third in both the women 's and the men 's competition .
the french women beat czechoslovakia 3-1 in the play-off for third place , while their male counterparts won 8-6 against switzerland . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's sporting heroes profit from successful year thanks to the sporting heroes who have contributed to one of the country 's most successful years for sport , things are n't all doom and gloom in germany .
