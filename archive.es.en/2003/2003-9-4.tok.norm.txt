files from the former east german secret police released by the cia two months ago suggest that one of west germany 's best-known investigative journalists may have been an informant for the stasi . he went undercover to expose the unsavory journalistic practices of germany 's largest tabloid ; he posed as " ali " to document the life of a turkish immigrant in germany during the early 1980s . if government documents from the former east germany are to be believed , it appears investigative journalist günter wallraff took on another role as well : that of a stasi spy . the head of the authority that oversees the mountains of files seized from the headquarters of the east german secret police after the collapse of the gdr confirmed on wednesday that wallraff was listed in the files as an informant in the late 1960s .
the confirmation ended years of speculation by various media on wallraff 's supposed stasi connections . " based on our current knowledge , " marianne birthler , the head of the authority , told the newspaper die welt , a " far-reaching exoneration " of wallraff is no longer possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter wallraff die welt first reported on the connection after getting hold of information on wallraff -lrb- photo -rrb- contained on cd-roms recently released by the cia .
the so-called " rosenwood " files were seized from stasi offices during the confusing transition that followed the fall of the berlin wall .
on july 1 , the cia removed the top secret designation on the files and sent them in the form of 381 cd-roms to birthler 's office . the files allege that wallraff , operating under the code name " wagner , " passed on documents from the bundeswehr officer 's training school and the chemical company bayer ag to the stasi while working for them from 1968 to the 1970s . the accusations , if proven , could be catastrophic for the respected leftist journalist and author 's reputation . wallraff calls accusations baseless wallraff rose to fame when he worked under a false identity for bild and left to write a tell-all book on the dirty newsgathering process of the mass-circulation daily in 1977 .
in the early 1980s , he " became " ali , a turkish immigrant who had come to work in germany , and wrote a best-selling non-fiction book about his experiences . the 60-year-old rigorously denied the charges on wednesday . " the new accusations are the old accusations , only that there are more index cards , " said wallraff , who lives in cologne . most sensational story to come out of files the story is likely to be the most sensational coming out of the files , say authorities . many of the 200,000 people listed in the files were friends , colleagues or relatives of east german spies and only a small number actually worked as agents , birthler said upon the files ' release . the rosewood files are nevertheless believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .
most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names . for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names , as wallraff learned on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .

the survey , based on the opinions of 8,000 people on both sides of the water , points to mixed opinions on the state of the relationship in both the u.s. and europe at a time when the two powers have seen some of the most radical shifts in their modern association .
germany sided more closely with its neighboring european allies than the united states for the first time since the end of world war ii amid rising tensions over iraq .
and , in a development that may surprise many , americans called for the european union to become a more dominant player in world affairs .
in the united states , many of those polled by the german marshall fund survey , 77 percent in fact , wanted their country to become more involved in global politics and shed its isolationist tendencies , a trait the u.s. has been saddled with since 1945 .
the gmf report that accompanied the survey said that this figure was the " highest level of support since americans were first asked the question in 1947 . "
americans support force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the invasion of iraq .
less surprisingly , however , the survey showed that a majority of u.s. participants would support the use of force to rid countries of weapons of mass destruction .
even less surprisingly , this was not a view shared by those europeans surveyed by the gmf .
it also appears that the americans are losing their enthusiasm for being the planet ’ s last remaining superpower .
last year , 52 percent were in favor of the united states maintaining that role but that figure has now decreased to 47 percent .
perhaps even more interesting is the 2 percent rise in those who want the eu to become a superpower capable of sharing the costs and risks of global problems , now at 37 percent .
the view that the eu should take on a more powerful role is supported by the europeans themselves who expressed a desire to be a partner of the u.s. rather than an entity that relies on it and is expected to do its bidding .
french , germans , italians reject strong us those europeans who support the idea of strong u.s. leadership dropped considerably in the last 12 months with 45 percent , compared to 64 percent in 2002 , in favor of a dominant america .
those who see this as desirable are mainly based in britain , the netherlands and poland where backing for such a role is strong .
the french , germans and italians , however , strongly oppose it .
majorities in europe also believe the eu - and not the us - is most vital to their national interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the eu commission romano prodi and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
shifts in germany are the most “ eye-catching , ” according to gmf .
germans are now a lot more confident about their role in global politics and demonstrate a strong preference for europe over the united states as their natural partner .
the percentage of germans who want their country to play an active role has risen to 82 percent from last year 's 65 percent , with 70 percent in favor of the eu becoming a superpower , an increase in 32 percent from 2002 .

files from the former east german secret police released by the cia two months ago suggest that one of west germany 's best-known investigative journalists may have been an informant for the stasi . he went undercover to expose the unsavory journalistic practices of germany 's largest tabloid ; he posed as " ali " to document the life of a turkish immigrant in germany during the early 1980s . if government documents from the former east germany are to be believed , it appears investigative journalist günter wallraff took on another role as well : that of a stasi spy . the head of the authority that oversees the mountains of files seized from the headquarters of the east german secret police after the collapse of the gdr confirmed on wednesday that wallraff was listed in the files as an informant in the late 1960s .
the confirmation ended years of speculation by various media on wallraff 's supposed stasi connections . " based on our current knowledge , " marianne birthler , the head of the authority , told the newspaper die welt , a " far-reaching exoneration " of wallraff is no longer possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter wallraff die welt first reported on the connection after getting hold of information on wallraff -lrb- photo -rrb- contained on cd-roms recently released by the cia .
the so-called " rosenwood " files were seized from stasi offices during the confusing transition that followed the fall of the berlin wall .
on july 1 , the cia removed the top secret designation on the files and sent them in the form of 381 cd-roms to birthler 's office . the files allege that wallraff , operating under the code name " wagner , " passed on documents from the bundeswehr officer 's training school and the chemical company bayer ag to the stasi while working for them from 1968 to the 1970s . the accusations , if proven , could be catastrophic for the respected leftist journalist and author 's reputation . wallraff calls accusations baseless wallraff rose to fame when he worked under a false identity for bild and left to write a tell-all book on the dirty newsgathering process of the mass-circulation daily in 1977 .
in the early 1980s , he " became " ali , a turkish immigrant who had come to work in germany , and wrote a best-selling non-fiction book about his experiences . the 60-year-old rigorously denied the charges on wednesday . " the new accusations are the old accusations , only that there are more index cards , " said wallraff , who lives in cologne . most sensational story to come out of files the story is likely to be the most sensational coming out of the files , say authorities . many of the 200,000 people listed in the files were friends , colleagues or relatives of east german spies and only a small number actually worked as agents , birthler said upon the files ' release . the rosewood files are nevertheless believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .
most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names . for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names , as wallraff learned on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .

german unemployment dipped lower in august from july , but officials said on thursday the labor market continued to stagnate as the number of people out of work remained far higher than for the same month a year ago . figures released by germany ’ s federal labor office on thursday showed unemployment in the world ’ s third largest economy dropped by around 38,000 in august from the previous month .
but with 4.313 million jobless , there were still almost 300,000 more people without work than a year earlier . chalked up to employment centers more actively pushing the unemployed for job placement , the monthly drop was larger than many economists had expected .
but the labor office warned against reading too much into the august figures and as if to highlight the “ underlying stagnation ” on labor market , the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 10.4 percent . “ we don ’ t expect an improvement of the labor market before the second quarter of 2004 and only when there ’ s an acceleration of the recovery in the second half , ” florian gerster , head of the nuremberg-based labor office , said at a press conference on thursday .
“ and even then there won ’ t suddenly be a truly mentionable amount . ” the number of unemployed in germany adjusted for seasonal factors remained unchanged in august , at 4.407 million people .
economists often put more stock in the seasonally adjusted figures because they smooth out the sharp changes that occur due to weather and holidays . five million jobless this winter ? some observers fear german joblessness could crack the five million mark this winter , when the labor market traditionally sheds jobs .
“ with the current state of the economy one has to actually assume it will be hit , ” rainer schmidt from kiel ’ s world economic institute told der spiegel magazine .
“ if job placement efforts work then maybe five million won ’ t be breached .
but we ’ ll certainly get close to this level . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster but the labor office ’ s gerster said the politically sensitive figure could be avoided if conditions remained favorable .
“ so long as we don ’ t have a hard winter , we ’ ll stay below five million , ” he said . with germany ’ s economy stuck in recession the first six months of 2003 , gerster and other officials are pinning their hopes on a recovery in the second half of the year .
however , even though there appear to be first signs that economy has put the worst behind it , growth this year and next are likely to be modest at best . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left coalition is betting the farm on his so-called " agenda 2010 , " a package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms aimed at reviving the lackluster economy and reducing the country ’ s chronically high unemployment .
but the conservative opposition and many economists worry the reforms do not go far enough to truly shake up germany ’ s stagnant labor market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sanctioning the unemployed german unemployment figures are on the rise .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2003 germany ponders " family vote " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german children could be facing tougher decisions in the future than where to play .
in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians . a controversial proposal to give children the right to vote in national elections is drawing support from a number of influential and powerful politicians in germany .
the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .
by tapping into those below that age , the proposed bill would immediately increase the number of potential voters by 13.8 million . supporters of the bill say that allowing children to vote would help germany in the future by giving the country ’ s youth a say in the policies that will affect them in the future .
the proposal carries a statement in support of that idea : " we can only secure the future of our society , when the concept of the family is given the chance to influence politics . " “ the idea would promote discussion within the family on issues that concern the children , ” said birgit meiners , spokesperson for bundestag vice president vollmer , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ subjects such as the environment and war are already in the consciousness of children as young as six .
families could consider these and the parents could vote for the party that supports the view of the child , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents would have the vote of their children .
meiners added that , in the case of those children who could be too young to formulate opinions , putting the power of the vote into the hands of the parents would more than likely lead to the vote being cast in support of policies that would benefit the family .
however , she conceded there could be problems deciding which parent casts the child ’ s vote in situations where a couple held different political affiliations . lower the voting age ? of course , if the plan for parental power over children ’ s votes proved too problematic , other alternatives exist .
the most popular would be to lower the voting age .
“ there could be discussions of lowering the voting age to 14 in local elections and to 16 in elections where wider issues were at stake , ” meiners said . one thing is certain : if the bill were to be approved , it would give those families with more children additional voting power .
but meiners denied criticisms that the legislation might create a disadvantage for single or childless voters .
“ there is no fear that singles would be discriminated against by this bill , " meiners said . " in berlin , for example , there are more one and two person households than families .
giving the family vote will bring balance in such areas . ” still , the bill faces numerous challenges , including a required change to the basic law , germany 's constitution - a move which requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the bundestag and the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber . meiners said it would be unlikely that the decision could be taken for at least two or three years . the bill also faces some formidable opposition .
not all politicians are in favor of extending voting rights to the new born .
spd party leader franz müntefering said the voting system should not be changed and christian democratic union general secretary laurenz meyer described the proposal as " unrealistic " . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de voting with the click of a mouse casting your vote over the internet with the mere click of the mouse sounds good .

the survey , based on the opinions of 8,000 people on both sides of the water , points to mixed opinions on the state of the relationship in both the u.s. and europe at a time when the two powers have seen some of the most radical shifts in their modern association .
germany sided more closely with its neighboring european allies than the united states for the first time since the end of world war ii amid rising tensions over iraq .
and , in a development that may surprise many , americans called for the european union to become a more dominant player in world affairs .
in the united states , many of those polled by the german marshall fund survey , 77 percent in fact , wanted their country to become more involved in global politics and shed its isolationist tendencies , a trait the u.s. has been saddled with since 1945 .
the gmf report that accompanied the survey said that this figure was the " highest level of support since americans were first asked the question in 1947 . "
americans support force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the invasion of iraq .
less surprisingly , however , the survey showed that a majority of u.s. participants would support the use of force to rid countries of weapons of mass destruction .
even less surprisingly , this was not a view shared by those europeans surveyed by the gmf .
it also appears that the americans are losing their enthusiasm for being the planet ’ s last remaining superpower .
last year , 52 percent were in favor of the united states maintaining that role but that figure has now decreased to 47 percent .
perhaps even more interesting is the 2 percent rise in those who want the eu to become a superpower capable of sharing the costs and risks of global problems , now at 37 percent .
the view that the eu should take on a more powerful role is supported by the europeans themselves who expressed a desire to be a partner of the u.s. rather than an entity that relies on it and is expected to do its bidding .
french , germans , italians reject strong us those europeans who support the idea of strong u.s. leadership dropped considerably in the last 12 months with 45 percent , compared to 64 percent in 2002 , in favor of a dominant america .
those who see this as desirable are mainly based in britain , the netherlands and poland where backing for such a role is strong .
the french , germans and italians , however , strongly oppose it .
majorities in europe also believe the eu - and not the us - is most vital to their national interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the eu commission romano prodi and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
shifts in germany are the most “ eye-catching , ” according to gmf .
germans are now a lot more confident about their role in global politics and demonstrate a strong preference for europe over the united states as their natural partner .
the percentage of germans who want their country to play an active role has risen to 82 percent from last year 's 65 percent , with 70 percent in favor of the eu becoming a superpower , an increase in 32 percent from 2002 .
however , that figure would drop to 36 percent if becoming a superpower meant european countries spending more on defense . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : transatlantic rapprochement following eu-u.s. summit europe and the united states are slowly smoothing out their troubled relations originating from the iraq conflict .

german unemployment dipped lower in august from july , but officials said on thursday the labor market continued to stagnate as the number of people out of work remained far higher than for the same month a year ago . figures released by germany ’ s federal labor office on thursday showed unemployment in the world ’ s third largest economy dropped by around 38,000 in august from the previous month .
but with 4.313 million jobless , there were still almost 300,000 more people without work than a year earlier . chalked up to employment centers more actively pushing the unemployed for job placement , the monthly drop was larger than many economists had expected .
but the labor office warned against reading too much into the august figures and as if to highlight the “ underlying stagnation ” on labor market , the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 10.4 percent . “ we don ’ t expect an improvement of the labor market before the second quarter of 2004 and only when there ’ s an acceleration of the recovery in the second half , ” florian gerster , head of the nuremberg-based labor office , said at a press conference on thursday .
“ and even then there won ’ t suddenly be a truly mentionable amount . ” the number of unemployed in germany adjusted for seasonal factors remained unchanged in august , at 4.407 million people .
economists often put more stock in the seasonally adjusted figures because they smooth out the sharp changes that occur due to weather and holidays . five million jobless this winter ? some observers fear german joblessness could crack the five million mark this winter , when the labor market traditionally sheds jobs .
“ with the current state of the economy one has to actually assume it will be hit , ” rainer schmidt from kiel ’ s world economic institute told der spiegel magazine .
“ if job placement efforts work then maybe five million won ’ t be breached .
but we ’ ll certainly get close to this level . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster but the labor office ’ s gerster said the politically sensitive figure could be avoided if conditions remained favorable .
“ so long as we don ’ t have a hard winter , we ’ ll stay below five million , ” he said . with germany ’ s economy stuck in recession the first six months of 2003 , gerster and other officials are pinning their hopes on a recovery in the second half of the year .
however , even though there appear to be first signs that economy has put the worst behind it , growth this year and next are likely to be modest at best . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left coalition is betting the farm on his so-called " agenda 2010 , " a package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms aimed at reviving the lackluster economy and reducing the country ’ s chronically high unemployment .
but the conservative opposition and many economists worry the reforms do not go far enough to truly shake up germany ’ s stagnant labor market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sanctioning the unemployed german unemployment figures are on the rise .

in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians . a controversial proposal to give children the right to vote in national elections is drawing support from a number of influential and powerful politicians in germany .
the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .
by tapping into those below that age , the proposed bill would immediately increase the number of potential voters by 13.8 million . supporters of the bill say that allowing children to vote would help germany in the future by giving the country ’ s youth a say in the policies that will affect them in the future .
the proposal carries a statement in support of that idea : " we can only secure the future of our society , when the concept of the family is given the chance to influence politics . " “ the idea would promote discussion within the family on issues that concern the children , ” said birgit meiners , spokesperson for bundestag vice president vollmer , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ subjects such as the environment and war are already in the consciousness of children as young as six .
families could consider these and the parents could vote for the party that supports the view of the child , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents would have the vote of their children .
meiners added that , in the case of those children who could be too young to formulate opinions , putting the power of the vote into the hands of the parents would more than likely lead to the vote being cast in support of policies that would benefit the family .
however , she conceded there could be problems deciding which parent casts the child ’ s vote in situations where a couple held different political affiliations . lower the voting age ? of course , if the plan for parental power over children ’ s votes proved too problematic , other alternatives exist .
the most popular would be to lower the voting age .
“ there could be discussions of lowering the voting age to 14 in local elections and to 16 in elections where wider issues were at stake , ” meiners said . one thing is certain : if the bill were to be approved , it would give those families with more children additional voting power .
but meiners denied criticisms that the legislation might create a disadvantage for single or childless voters .
“ there is no fear that singles would be discriminated against by this bill , " meiners said . " in berlin , for example , there are more one and two person households than families .
giving the family vote will bring balance in such areas . ” still , the bill faces numerous challenges , including a required change to the basic law , germany 's constitution - a move which requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the bundestag and the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber . meiners said it would be unlikely that the decision could be taken for at least two or three years . the bill also faces some formidable opposition .

the leaders of france and germany say a new u.s. security resolution currently circulating in the united nations still does not give the organization a large enough role . at a joint press conference in dresden , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder said the new u.s. resolution calling for a u.n. role in iraq is " not dynamic enough . " the two iraq war opponents would not comment on details of the resolution , which has yet to be officially introduced and is still being worked on by the bush administration . but chirac told reporters that " the proposals … seem quite far from what appears to us to be the primary objective , namely the transfer of political responsibility to an iraqi government as soon as possible . " the draft resolution being worked on in washington reportedly keeps political power in the hands of u.s. appointee paul bremer , the country 's civilian administrator . schröder said the proposals were n't " dynamic enough , or sufficient enough . " u.n. role pivotal for other countries with the body count among u.s. and british troops rising on an almost daily level , the governments in london and washington have been scrambling to get other nations to pledge troops or involve themselves otherwise in iraq . major allies like russia , france and the arab nations have said they will only consider involvement if it is underneath a u.n. umbrella . after initially hesitating on giving the u.n. a major role in postwar iraq , the bush administration has begun to bend a bit amid increasing lawlessness and terrorism in the newly-conquered country . the draft resolution calls for a multinational force under a u.n. mandate but under the control of an american to maintain peace in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eine ehrenformation praesentiert das gewehr anlaesslich des besuchs der franzoesischen verteidigungministerin michele alliot-marie bei der deutsch-franzoesischen brigade in muellheim am donnerstag , 4 .

german unemployment dipped lower in august from july , but officials said on thursday the labor market continued to stagnate as the number of people out of work remained far higher than for the same month a year ago . figures released by germany ’ s federal labor office on thursday showed unemployment in the world ’ s third largest economy dropped by around 38,000 in august from the previous month .
but with 4.313 million jobless , there were still almost 300,000 more people without work than a year earlier . chalked up to employment centers more actively pushing the unemployed for job placement , the monthly drop was larger than many economists had expected .
but the labor office warned against reading too much into the august figures and as if to highlight the “ underlying stagnation ” on labor market , the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 10.4 percent . “ we don ’ t expect an improvement of the labor market before the second quarter of 2004 and only when there ’ s an acceleration of the recovery in the second half , ” florian gerster , head of the nuremberg-based labor office , said at a press conference on thursday .
“ and even then there won ’ t suddenly be a truly mentionable amount . ” the number of unemployed in germany adjusted for seasonal factors remained unchanged in august , at 4.407 million people .
economists often put more stock in the seasonally adjusted figures because they smooth out the sharp changes that occur due to weather and holidays . five million jobless this winter ? some observers fear german joblessness could crack the five million mark this winter , when the labor market traditionally sheds jobs .
“ with the current state of the economy one has to actually assume it will be hit , ” rainer schmidt from kiel ’ s world economic institute told der spiegel magazine .
“ if job placement efforts work then maybe five million won ’ t be breached .
but we ’ ll certainly get close to this level . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster but the labor office ’ s gerster said the politically sensitive figure could be avoided if conditions remained favorable .
“ so long as we don ’ t have a hard winter , we ’ ll stay below five million , ” he said . with germany ’ s economy stuck in recession the first six months of 2003 , gerster and other officials are pinning their hopes on a recovery in the second half of the year .
however , even though there appear to be first signs that economy has put the worst behind it , growth this year and next are likely to be modest at best . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left coalition is betting the farm on his so-called " agenda 2010 , " a package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms aimed at reviving the lackluster economy and reducing the country ’ s chronically high unemployment .
but the conservative opposition and many economists worry the reforms do not go far enough to truly shake up germany ’ s stagnant labor market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sanctioning the unemployed german unemployment figures are on the rise .

files from the former east german secret police released by the cia two months ago suggest that one of west germany 's best-known investigative journalists may have been an informant for the stasi . he went undercover to expose the unsavory journalistic practices of germany 's largest tabloid ; he posed as " ali " to document the life of a turkish immigrant in germany during the early 1980s . if government documents from the former east germany are to be believed , it appears investigative journalist günter wallraff took on another role as well : that of a stasi spy . the head of the authority that oversees the mountains of files seized from the headquarters of the east german secret police after the collapse of the gdr confirmed on wednesday that wallraff was listed in the files as an informant in the late 1960s .
the confirmation ended years of speculation by various media on wallraff 's supposed stasi connections . " based on our current knowledge , " marianne birthler , the head of the authority , told the newspaper die welt , a " far-reaching exoneration " of wallraff is no longer possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter wallraff die welt first reported on the connection after getting hold of information on wallraff -lrb- photo -rrb- contained on cd-roms recently released by the cia .
the so-called " rosenwood " files were seized from stasi offices during the confusing transition that followed the fall of the berlin wall .
on july 1 , the cia removed the top secret designation on the files and sent them in the form of 381 cd-roms to birthler 's office . the files allege that wallraff , operating under the code name " wagner , " passed on documents from the bundeswehr officer 's training school and the chemical company bayer ag to the stasi while working for them from 1968 to the 1970s . the accusations , if proven , could be catastrophic for the respected leftist journalist and author 's reputation . wallraff calls accusations baseless wallraff rose to fame when he worked under a false identity for bild and left to write a tell-all book on the dirty newsgathering process of the mass-circulation daily in 1977 .
in the early 1980s , he " became " ali , a turkish immigrant who had come to work in germany , and wrote a best-selling non-fiction book about his experiences . the 60-year-old rigorously denied the charges on wednesday . " the new accusations are the old accusations , only that there are more index cards , " said wallraff , who lives in cologne . most sensational story to come out of files the story is likely to be the most sensational coming out of the files , say authorities . many of the 200,000 people listed in the files were friends , colleagues or relatives of east german spies and only a small number actually worked as agents , birthler said upon the files ' release . the rosewood files are nevertheless believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .
most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names . for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names , as wallraff learned on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .

the leaders of france and germany say a new u.s. security resolution currently circulating in the united nations still does not give the organization a large enough role . at a joint press conference in dresden , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder said the new u.s. resolution calling for a u.n. role in iraq is " not dynamic enough . " the two iraq war opponents would not comment on details of the resolution , which has yet to be officially introduced and is still being worked on by the bush administration . but chirac told reporters that " the proposals … seem quite far from what appears to us to be the primary objective , namely the transfer of political responsibility to an iraqi government as soon as possible . " the draft resolution being worked on in washington reportedly keeps political power in the hands of u.s. appointee paul bremer , the country 's civilian administrator . schröder said the proposals were n't " dynamic enough , or sufficient enough . " u.n. role pivotal for other countries with the body count among u.s. and british troops rising on an almost daily level , the governments in london and washington have been scrambling to get other nations to pledge troops or involve themselves otherwise in iraq . major allies like russia , france and the arab nations have said they will only consider involvement if it is underneath a u.n. umbrella . after initially hesitating on giving the u.n. a major role in postwar iraq , the bush administration has begun to bend a bit amid increasing lawlessness and terrorism in the newly-conquered country . the draft resolution calls for a multinational force under a u.n. mandate but under the control of an american to maintain peace in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eine ehrenformation praesentiert das gewehr anlaesslich des besuchs der franzoesischen verteidigungministerin michele alliot-marie bei der deutsch-franzoesischen brigade in muellheim am donnerstag , 4 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- government officials of the two european powers said they are willing to work with the u.s. proposal . germany : still no iraq troops whatever the differences in the past , the point now is about " giving iraq and stability and democratic perspective , " said schröder . but german government politicians maintained that they would not send bundeswehr troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate . " from our view , we 've contributed so far with humanitarian aid , " olaf scholz , the general secretary of schröder 's social democratic party told german radio .

german unemployment dipped lower in august from july , but officials said on thursday the labor market continued to stagnate as the number of people out of work remained far higher than for the same month a year ago . figures released by germany ’ s federal labor office on thursday showed unemployment in the world ’ s third largest economy dropped by around 38,000 in august from the previous month .
but with 4.313 million jobless , there were still almost 300,000 more people without work than a year earlier . chalked up to employment centers more actively pushing the unemployed for job placement , the monthly drop was larger than many economists had expected .
but the labor office warned against reading too much into the august figures and as if to highlight the “ underlying stagnation ” on labor market , the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 10.4 percent . “ we don ’ t expect an improvement of the labor market before the second quarter of 2004 and only when there ’ s an acceleration of the recovery in the second half , ” florian gerster , head of the nuremberg-based labor office , said at a press conference on thursday .
“ and even then there won ’ t suddenly be a truly mentionable amount . ” the number of unemployed in germany adjusted for seasonal factors remained unchanged in august , at 4.407 million people .
economists often put more stock in the seasonally adjusted figures because they smooth out the sharp changes that occur due to weather and holidays . five million jobless this winter ? some observers fear german joblessness could crack the five million mark this winter , when the labor market traditionally sheds jobs .
“ with the current state of the economy one has to actually assume it will be hit , ” rainer schmidt from kiel ’ s world economic institute told der spiegel magazine .
“ if job placement efforts work then maybe five million won ’ t be breached .
but we ’ ll certainly get close to this level . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster but the labor office ’ s gerster said the politically sensitive figure could be avoided if conditions remained favorable .
“ so long as we don ’ t have a hard winter , we ’ ll stay below five million , ” he said . with germany ’ s economy stuck in recession the first six months of 2003 , gerster and other officials are pinning their hopes on a recovery in the second half of the year .
however , even though there appear to be first signs that economy has put the worst behind it , growth this year and next are likely to be modest at best . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left coalition is betting the farm on his so-called " agenda 2010 , " a package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms aimed at reviving the lackluster economy and reducing the country ’ s chronically high unemployment .

german unemployment dipped lower in august from july , but officials said on thursday the labor market continued to stagnate as the number of people out of work remained far higher than for the same month a year ago . figures released by germany ’ s federal labor office on thursday showed unemployment in the world ’ s third largest economy dropped by around 38,000 in august from the previous month .
but with 4.313 million jobless , there were still almost 300,000 more people without work than a year earlier . chalked up to employment centers more actively pushing the unemployed for job placement , the monthly drop was larger than many economists had expected .
but the labor office warned against reading too much into the august figures and as if to highlight the “ underlying stagnation ” on labor market , the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 10.4 percent . “ we don ’ t expect an improvement of the labor market before the second quarter of 2004 and only when there ’ s an acceleration of the recovery in the second half , ” florian gerster , head of the nuremberg-based labor office , said at a press conference on thursday .
“ and even then there won ’ t suddenly be a truly mentionable amount . ” the number of unemployed in germany adjusted for seasonal factors remained unchanged in august , at 4.407 million people .
economists often put more stock in the seasonally adjusted figures because they smooth out the sharp changes that occur due to weather and holidays . five million jobless this winter ? some observers fear german joblessness could crack the five million mark this winter , when the labor market traditionally sheds jobs .
“ with the current state of the economy one has to actually assume it will be hit , ” rainer schmidt from kiel ’ s world economic institute told der spiegel magazine .
“ if job placement efforts work then maybe five million won ’ t be breached .
but we ’ ll certainly get close to this level . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster but the labor office ’ s gerster said the politically sensitive figure could be avoided if conditions remained favorable .
“ so long as we don ’ t have a hard winter , we ’ ll stay below five million , ” he said . with germany ’ s economy stuck in recession the first six months of 2003 , gerster and other officials are pinning their hopes on a recovery in the second half of the year .
however , even though there appear to be first signs that economy has put the worst behind it , growth this year and next are likely to be modest at best . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left coalition is betting the farm on his so-called " agenda 2010 , " a package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms aimed at reviving the lackluster economy and reducing the country ’ s chronically high unemployment .
but the conservative opposition and many economists worry the reforms do not go far enough to truly shake up germany ’ s stagnant labor market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sanctioning the unemployed german unemployment figures are on the rise .
to help turn the tide , the government may combine unemployment and social assistance benefits and sanction able body recipients who do n't take available jobs .

germany 's economy minister has sparked a debate by saying germans should work more to help the economy .

in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians . a controversial proposal to give children the right to vote in national elections is drawing support from a number of influential and powerful politicians in germany .
the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .
by tapping into those below that age , the proposed bill would immediately increase the number of potential voters by 13.8 million . supporters of the bill say that allowing children to vote would help germany in the future by giving the country ’ s youth a say in the policies that will affect them in the future .
the proposal carries a statement in support of that idea : " we can only secure the future of our society , when the concept of the family is given the chance to influence politics . " “ the idea would promote discussion within the family on issues that concern the children , ” said birgit meiners , spokesperson for bundestag vice president vollmer , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ subjects such as the environment and war are already in the consciousness of children as young as six .
families could consider these and the parents could vote for the party that supports the view of the child , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents would have the vote of their children .
meiners added that , in the case of those children who could be too young to formulate opinions , putting the power of the vote into the hands of the parents would more than likely lead to the vote being cast in support of policies that would benefit the family .
however , she conceded there could be problems deciding which parent casts the child ’ s vote in situations where a couple held different political affiliations . lower the voting age ? of course , if the plan for parental power over children ’ s votes proved too problematic , other alternatives exist .
the most popular would be to lower the voting age .
“ there could be discussions of lowering the voting age to 14 in local elections and to 16 in elections where wider issues were at stake , ” meiners said . one thing is certain : if the bill were to be approved , it would give those families with more children additional voting power .
but meiners denied criticisms that the legislation might create a disadvantage for single or childless voters .
“ there is no fear that singles would be discriminated against by this bill , " meiners said . " in berlin , for example , there are more one and two person households than families .
giving the family vote will bring balance in such areas . ” still , the bill faces numerous challenges , including a required change to the basic law , germany 's constitution - a move which requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the bundestag and the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber . meiners said it would be unlikely that the decision could be taken for at least two or three years . the bill also faces some formidable opposition .
not all politicians are in favor of extending voting rights to the new born .

in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians . a controversial proposal to give children the right to vote in national elections is drawing support from a number of influential and powerful politicians in germany .
the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .
by tapping into those below that age , the proposed bill would immediately increase the number of potential voters by 13.8 million . supporters of the bill say that allowing children to vote would help germany in the future by giving the country ’ s youth a say in the policies that will affect them in the future .
the proposal carries a statement in support of that idea : " we can only secure the future of our society , when the concept of the family is given the chance to influence politics .

the survey , based on the opinions of 8,000 people on both sides of the water , points to mixed opinions on the state of the relationship in both the u.s. and europe at a time when the two powers have seen some of the most radical shifts in their modern association .
germany sided more closely with its neighboring european allies than the united states for the first time since the end of world war ii amid rising tensions over iraq .
and , in a development that may surprise many , americans called for the european union to become a more dominant player in world affairs .
in the united states , many of those polled by the german marshall fund survey , 77 percent in fact , wanted their country to become more involved in global politics and shed its isolationist tendencies , a trait the u.s. has been saddled with since 1945 .
the gmf report that accompanied the survey said that this figure was the " highest level of support since americans were first asked the question in 1947 . "
americans support force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the invasion of iraq .
less surprisingly , however , the survey showed that a majority of u.s. participants would support the use of force to rid countries of weapons of mass destruction .
even less surprisingly , this was not a view shared by those europeans surveyed by the gmf .
it also appears that the americans are losing their enthusiasm for being the planet ’ s last remaining superpower .
last year , 52 percent were in favor of the united states maintaining that role but that figure has now decreased to 47 percent .
perhaps even more interesting is the 2 percent rise in those who want the eu to become a superpower capable of sharing the costs and risks of global problems , now at 37 percent .
the view that the eu should take on a more powerful role is supported by the europeans themselves who expressed a desire to be a partner of the u.s. rather than an entity that relies on it and is expected to do its bidding .
french , germans , italians reject strong us those europeans who support the idea of strong u.s. leadership dropped considerably in the last 12 months with 45 percent , compared to 64 percent in 2002 , in favor of a dominant america .
those who see this as desirable are mainly based in britain , the netherlands and poland where backing for such a role is strong .
the french , germans and italians , however , strongly oppose it .
majorities in europe also believe the eu - and not the us - is most vital to their national interests .

shifts in germany are the most “ eye-catching , ” according to gmf .
germans are now a lot more confident about their role in global politics and demonstrate a strong preference for europe over the united states as their natural partner .
the percentage of germans who want their country to play an active role has risen to 82 percent from last year 's 65 percent , with 70 percent in favor of the eu becoming a superpower , an increase in 32 percent from 2002 .

" it is now time to adjust to the new situation in iraq , " the paper wrote .
it would be in the international community ’ s interest to " put out the fire that is iraq as quickly as possible . " the moscow-based daily kommersant had a different take on things .
it wrote that since the united states went to war without u.n. support , it should settle the mess on its own . corriere della sera was more conciliatory .
the italian paper said a new u.n. resolution would be necessary to get countries such as india , bangladesh and turkey to commit troops to iraq . the financial times cautioned countries that were against the war from sending troops now on the basis of a new resolution .
" the opponents of u.s. action in iraq face an unenviable choice , " the london-based paper wrote .
if they agreed to a u.n. role and took part in a postwar clean-up they would have - in the end - done america ’ s bidding . the french daily libération agreed .
" under what conditions should a country allow itself to get involved in such an adventure - especially countries that were so dead-set against sending in troops from the beginning ? " it asked .
still , it reminded sceptics , it would be irresponsible to just sit around and do nothing . another issue of editorials was the crisis in the middle east .
the swiss tages-anzeiger criticized both palestinian prime minister abbas and the israelis for not living up to their sides of the bargain in working to bring peace to the region .
both agreed to the peace plan , but in practice they were not helping to improve the situation , the paper said .
prime minister abbas still hadn ’ t done enough to disband palestinian terror groups and the israelis continued to build settlements , it said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the leaders of france and germany say a new u.s. security resolution currently circulating in the united nations still does not give the organization a large enough role . at a joint press conference in dresden , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder said the new u.s. resolution calling for a u.n. role in iraq is " not dynamic enough . " the two iraq war opponents would not comment on details of the resolution , which has yet to be officially introduced and is still being worked on by the bush administration . but chirac told reporters that " the proposals … seem quite far from what appears to us to be the primary objective , namely the transfer of political responsibility to an iraqi government as soon as possible . " the draft resolution being worked on in washington reportedly keeps political power in the hands of u.s. appointee paul bremer , the country 's civilian administrator . schröder said the proposals were n't " dynamic enough , or sufficient enough . " u.n. role pivotal for other countries with the body count among u.s. and british troops rising on an almost daily level , the governments in london and washington have been scrambling to get other nations to pledge troops or involve themselves otherwise in iraq . major allies like russia , france and the arab nations have said they will only consider involvement if it is underneath a u.n. umbrella . after initially hesitating on giving the u.n. a major role in postwar iraq , the bush administration has begun to bend a bit amid increasing lawlessness and terrorism in the newly-conquered country . the draft resolution calls for a multinational force under a u.n. mandate but under the control of an american to maintain peace in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eine ehrenformation praesentiert das gewehr anlaesslich des besuchs der franzoesischen verteidigungministerin michele alliot-marie bei der deutsch-franzoesischen brigade in muellheim am donnerstag , 4 .

" from our view , we 've contributed so far with humanitarian aid , " olaf scholz , the general secretary of schröder 's social democratic party told german radio .

the survey , based on the opinions of 8,000 people on both sides of the water , points to mixed opinions on the state of the relationship in both the u.s. and europe at a time when the two powers have seen some of the most radical shifts in their modern association .
germany sided more closely with its neighboring european allies than the united states for the first time since the end of world war ii amid rising tensions over iraq .
and , in a development that may surprise many , americans called for the european union to become a more dominant player in world affairs .
in the united states , many of those polled by the german marshall fund survey , 77 percent in fact , wanted their country to become more involved in global politics and shed its isolationist tendencies , a trait the u.s. has been saddled with since 1945 .
the gmf report that accompanied the survey said that this figure was the " highest level of support since americans were first asked the question in 1947 . "
americans support force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the invasion of iraq .
less surprisingly , however , the survey showed that a majority of u.s. participants would support the use of force to rid countries of weapons of mass destruction .
even less surprisingly , this was not a view shared by those europeans surveyed by the gmf .
it also appears that the americans are losing their enthusiasm for being the planet ’ s last remaining superpower .
last year , 52 percent were in favor of the united states maintaining that role but that figure has now decreased to 47 percent .
perhaps even more interesting is the 2 percent rise in those who want the eu to become a superpower capable of sharing the costs and risks of global problems , now at 37 percent .
the view that the eu should take on a more powerful role is supported by the europeans themselves who expressed a desire to be a partner of the u.s. rather than an entity that relies on it and is expected to do its bidding .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.09.2003 famed journalist accused of stasi ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin office where stasi files are piled to the ceiling , just waiting to incriminate someone .
files from the former east german secret police released by the cia two months ago suggest that one of west germany 's best-known investigative journalists may have been an informant for the stasi . he went undercover to expose the unsavory journalistic practices of germany 's largest tabloid ; he posed as " ali " to document the life of a turkish immigrant in germany during the early 1980s . if government documents from the former east germany are to be believed , it appears investigative journalist günter wallraff took on another role as well : that of a stasi spy . the head of the authority that oversees the mountains of files seized from the headquarters of the east german secret police after the collapse of the gdr confirmed on wednesday that wallraff was listed in the files as an informant in the late 1960s .
the confirmation ended years of speculation by various media on wallraff 's supposed stasi connections . " based on our current knowledge , " marianne birthler , the head of the authority , told the newspaper die welt , a " far-reaching exoneration " of wallraff is no longer possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter wallraff die welt first reported on the connection after getting hold of information on wallraff -lrb- photo -rrb- contained on cd-roms recently released by the cia .
the so-called " rosenwood " files were seized from stasi offices during the confusing transition that followed the fall of the berlin wall .

the leaders of france and germany say a new u.s. security resolution currently circulating in the united nations still does not give the organization a large enough role . at a joint press conference in dresden , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder said the new u.s. resolution calling for a u.n. role in iraq is " not dynamic enough . " the two iraq war opponents would not comment on details of the resolution , which has yet to be officially introduced and is still being worked on by the bush administration . but chirac told reporters that " the proposals … seem quite far from what appears to us to be the primary objective , namely the transfer of political responsibility to an iraqi government as soon as possible . " the draft resolution being worked on in washington reportedly keeps political power in the hands of u.s. appointee paul bremer , the country 's civilian administrator . schröder said the proposals were n't " dynamic enough , or sufficient enough . " u.n. role pivotal for other countries with the body count among u.s. and british troops rising on an almost daily level , the governments in london and washington have been scrambling to get other nations to pledge troops or involve themselves otherwise in iraq . major allies like russia , france and the arab nations have said they will only consider involvement if it is underneath a u.n. umbrella . after initially hesitating on giving the u.n. a major role in postwar iraq , the bush administration has begun to bend a bit amid increasing lawlessness and terrorism in the newly-conquered country . the draft resolution calls for a multinational force under a u.n. mandate but under the control of an american to maintain peace in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eine ehrenformation praesentiert das gewehr anlaesslich des besuchs der franzoesischen verteidigungministerin michele alliot-marie bei der deutsch-franzoesischen brigade in muellheim am donnerstag , 4 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.09.2003 survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a while since washington has been close to berlin a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many . a survey released this week by the german marshall fund of the united states -lrb- gmf -rrb- shows an interesting insight into the views of americans and europeans as relations between the transatlantic partners continue to ebb and flow .
the survey , based on the opinions of 8,000 people on both sides of the water , points to mixed opinions on the state of the relationship in both the u.s. and europe at a time when the two powers have seen some of the most radical shifts in their modern association .
germany sided more closely with its neighboring european allies than the united states for the first time since the end of world war ii amid rising tensions over iraq .
and , in a development that may surprise many , americans called for the european union to become a more dominant player in world affairs .
in the united states , many of those polled by the german marshall fund survey , 77 percent in fact , wanted their country to become more involved in global politics and shed its isolationist tendencies , a trait the u.s. has been saddled with since 1945 .
the gmf report that accompanied the survey said that this figure was the " highest level of support since americans were first asked the question in 1947 . "
americans support force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the invasion of iraq .
less surprisingly , however , the survey showed that a majority of u.s. participants would support the use of force to rid countries of weapons of mass destruction .
even less surprisingly , this was not a view shared by those europeans surveyed by the gmf .
it also appears that the americans are losing their enthusiasm for being the planet ’ s last remaining superpower .
last year , 52 percent were in favor of the united states maintaining that role but that figure has now decreased to 47 percent .
perhaps even more interesting is the 2 percent rise in those who want the eu to become a superpower capable of sharing the costs and risks of global problems , now at 37 percent .
the view that the eu should take on a more powerful role is supported by the europeans themselves who expressed a desire to be a partner of the u.s. rather than an entity that relies on it and is expected to do its bidding .
french , germans , italians reject strong us those europeans who support the idea of strong u.s. leadership dropped considerably in the last 12 months with 45 percent , compared to 64 percent in 2002 , in favor of a dominant america .
those who see this as desirable are mainly based in britain , the netherlands and poland where backing for such a role is strong .
the french , germans and italians , however , strongly oppose it .
majorities in europe also believe the eu - and not the us - is most vital to their national interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the eu commission romano prodi and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
shifts in germany are the most “ eye-catching , ” according to gmf .
germans are now a lot more confident about their role in global politics and demonstrate a strong preference for europe over the united states as their natural partner .
the percentage of germans who want their country to play an active role has risen to 82 percent from last year 's 65 percent , with 70 percent in favor of the eu becoming a superpower , an increase in 32 percent from 2002 .
however , that figure would drop to 36 percent if becoming a superpower meant european countries spending more on defense . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : transatlantic rapprochement following eu-u.s. summit europe and the united states are slowly smoothing out their troubled relations originating from the iraq conflict .

german unemployment dipped lower in august from july , but officials said on thursday the labor market continued to stagnate as the number of people out of work remained far higher than for the same month a year ago . figures released by germany ’ s federal labor office on thursday showed unemployment in the world ’ s third largest economy dropped by around 38,000 in august from the previous month .
but with 4.313 million jobless , there were still almost 300,000 more people without work than a year earlier . chalked up to employment centers more actively pushing the unemployed for job placement , the monthly drop was larger than many economists had expected .
but the labor office warned against reading too much into the august figures and as if to highlight the “ underlying stagnation ” on labor market , the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 10.4 percent . “ we don ’ t expect an improvement of the labor market before the second quarter of 2004 and only when there ’ s an acceleration of the recovery in the second half , ” florian gerster , head of the nuremberg-based labor office , said at a press conference on thursday .
“ and even then there won ’ t suddenly be a truly mentionable amount . ” the number of unemployed in germany adjusted for seasonal factors remained unchanged in august , at 4.407 million people .
economists often put more stock in the seasonally adjusted figures because they smooth out the sharp changes that occur due to weather and holidays . five million jobless this winter ? some observers fear german joblessness could crack the five million mark this winter , when the labor market traditionally sheds jobs .
“ with the current state of the economy one has to actually assume it will be hit , ” rainer schmidt from kiel ’ s world economic institute told der spiegel magazine .
“ if job placement efforts work then maybe five million won ’ t be breached .
but we ’ ll certainly get close to this level . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster but the labor office ’ s gerster said the politically sensitive figure could be avoided if conditions remained favorable .
“ so long as we don ’ t have a hard winter , we ’ ll stay below five million , ” he said . with germany ’ s economy stuck in recession the first six months of 2003 , gerster and other officials are pinning their hopes on a recovery in the second half of the year .
however , even though there appear to be first signs that economy has put the worst behind it , growth this year and next are likely to be modest at best . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left coalition is betting the farm on his so-called " agenda 2010 , " a package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms aimed at reviving the lackluster economy and reducing the country ’ s chronically high unemployment .
but the conservative opposition and many economists worry the reforms do not go far enough to truly shake up germany ’ s stagnant labor market . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany debates sanctioning the unemployed german unemployment figures are on the rise .

the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .
by tapping into those below that age , the proposed bill would immediately increase the number of potential voters by 13.8 million . supporters of the bill say that allowing children to vote would help germany in the future by giving the country ’ s youth a say in the policies that will affect them in the future .
the proposal carries a statement in support of that idea : " we can only secure the future of our society , when the concept of the family is given the chance to influence politics . " “ the idea would promote discussion within the family on issues that concern the children , ” said birgit meiners , spokesperson for bundestag vice president vollmer , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ subjects such as the environment and war are already in the consciousness of children as young as six .
families could consider these and the parents could vote for the party that supports the view of the child , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents would have the vote of their children .
meiners added that , in the case of those children who could be too young to formulate opinions , putting the power of the vote into the hands of the parents would more than likely lead to the vote being cast in support of policies that would benefit the family .
however , she conceded there could be problems deciding which parent casts the child ’ s vote in situations where a couple held different political affiliations . lower the voting age ? of course , if the plan for parental power over children ’ s votes proved too problematic , other alternatives exist .
the most popular would be to lower the voting age .
“ there could be discussions of lowering the voting age to 14 in local elections and to 16 in elections where wider issues were at stake , ” meiners said . one thing is certain : if the bill were to be approved , it would give those families with more children additional voting power .
but meiners denied criticisms that the legislation might create a disadvantage for single or childless voters .
“ there is no fear that singles would be discriminated against by this bill , " meiners said . " in berlin , for example , there are more one and two person households than families .
giving the family vote will bring balance in such areas . ” still , the bill faces numerous challenges , including a required change to the basic law , germany 's constitution - a move which requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the bundestag and the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber . meiners said it would be unlikely that the decision could be taken for at least two or three years . the bill also faces some formidable opposition .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2003 germany ponders " family vote " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german children could be facing tougher decisions in the future than where to play .
in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians . a controversial proposal to give children the right to vote in national elections is drawing support from a number of influential and powerful politicians in germany .
the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .
by tapping into those below that age , the proposed bill would immediately increase the number of potential voters by 13.8 million . supporters of the bill say that allowing children to vote would help germany in the future by giving the country ’ s youth a say in the policies that will affect them in the future .
the proposal carries a statement in support of that idea : " we can only secure the future of our society , when the concept of the family is given the chance to influence politics . " “ the idea would promote discussion within the family on issues that concern the children , ” said birgit meiners , spokesperson for bundestag vice president vollmer , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ subjects such as the environment and war are already in the consciousness of children as young as six .
families could consider these and the parents could vote for the party that supports the view of the child , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents would have the vote of their children .

german unemployment dipped lower in august from july , but officials said on thursday the labor market continued to stagnate as the number of people out of work remained far higher than for the same month a year ago . figures released by germany ’ s federal labor office on thursday showed unemployment in the world ’ s third largest economy dropped by around 38,000 in august from the previous month .
but with 4.313 million jobless , there were still almost 300,000 more people without work than a year earlier . chalked up to employment centers more actively pushing the unemployed for job placement , the monthly drop was larger than many economists had expected .
but the labor office warned against reading too much into the august figures and as if to highlight the “ underlying stagnation ” on labor market , the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 10.4 percent . “ we don ’ t expect an improvement of the labor market before the second quarter of 2004 and only when there ’ s an acceleration of the recovery in the second half , ” florian gerster , head of the nuremberg-based labor office , said at a press conference on thursday .
“ and even then there won ’ t suddenly be a truly mentionable amount . ” the number of unemployed in germany adjusted for seasonal factors remained unchanged in august , at 4.407 million people .
economists often put more stock in the seasonally adjusted figures because they smooth out the sharp changes that occur due to weather and holidays . five million jobless this winter ? some observers fear german joblessness could crack the five million mark this winter , when the labor market traditionally sheds jobs .
“ with the current state of the economy one has to actually assume it will be hit , ” rainer schmidt from kiel ’ s world economic institute told der spiegel magazine .

but we ’ ll certainly get close to this level . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster but the labor office ’ s gerster said the politically sensitive figure could be avoided if conditions remained favorable .
“ so long as we don ’ t have a hard winter , we ’ ll stay below five million , ” he said . with germany ’ s economy stuck in recession the first six months of 2003 , gerster and other officials are pinning their hopes on a recovery in the second half of the year .
however , even though there appear to be first signs that economy has put the worst behind it , growth this year and next are likely to be modest at best . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left coalition is betting the farm on his so-called " agenda 2010 , " a package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms aimed at reviving the lackluster economy and reducing the country ’ s chronically high unemployment .

the survey , based on the opinions of 8,000 people on both sides of the water , points to mixed opinions on the state of the relationship in both the u.s. and europe at a time when the two powers have seen some of the most radical shifts in their modern association .
germany sided more closely with its neighboring european allies than the united states for the first time since the end of world war ii amid rising tensions over iraq .
and , in a development that may surprise many , americans called for the european union to become a more dominant player in world affairs .
in the united states , many of those polled by the german marshall fund survey , 77 percent in fact , wanted their country to become more involved in global politics and shed its isolationist tendencies , a trait the u.s. has been saddled with since 1945 .
the gmf report that accompanied the survey said that this figure was the " highest level of support since americans were first asked the question in 1947 . "
americans support force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the invasion of iraq .
less surprisingly , however , the survey showed that a majority of u.s. participants would support the use of force to rid countries of weapons of mass destruction .
even less surprisingly , this was not a view shared by those europeans surveyed by the gmf .
it also appears that the americans are losing their enthusiasm for being the planet ’ s last remaining superpower .
last year , 52 percent were in favor of the united states maintaining that role but that figure has now decreased to 47 percent .
perhaps even more interesting is the 2 percent rise in those who want the eu to become a superpower capable of sharing the costs and risks of global problems , now at 37 percent .
the view that the eu should take on a more powerful role is supported by the europeans themselves who expressed a desire to be a partner of the u.s. rather than an entity that relies on it and is expected to do its bidding .
french , germans , italians reject strong us those europeans who support the idea of strong u.s. leadership dropped considerably in the last 12 months with 45 percent , compared to 64 percent in 2002 , in favor of a dominant america .
those who see this as desirable are mainly based in britain , the netherlands and poland where backing for such a role is strong .
the french , germans and italians , however , strongly oppose it .
majorities in europe also believe the eu - and not the us - is most vital to their national interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the eu commission romano prodi and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
shifts in germany are the most “ eye-catching , ” according to gmf .
germans are now a lot more confident about their role in global politics and demonstrate a strong preference for europe over the united states as their natural partner .
the percentage of germans who want their country to play an active role has risen to 82 percent from last year 's 65 percent , with 70 percent in favor of the eu becoming a superpower , an increase in 32 percent from 2002 .
however , that figure would drop to 36 percent if becoming a superpower meant european countries spending more on defense . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : transatlantic rapprochement following eu-u.s. summit europe and the united states are slowly smoothing out their troubled relations originating from the iraq conflict .

files from the former east german secret police released by the cia two months ago suggest that one of west germany 's best-known investigative journalists may have been an informant for the stasi . he went undercover to expose the unsavory journalistic practices of germany 's largest tabloid ; he posed as " ali " to document the life of a turkish immigrant in germany during the early 1980s . if government documents from the former east germany are to be believed , it appears investigative journalist günter wallraff took on another role as well : that of a stasi spy . the head of the authority that oversees the mountains of files seized from the headquarters of the east german secret police after the collapse of the gdr confirmed on wednesday that wallraff was listed in the files as an informant in the late 1960s .
the confirmation ended years of speculation by various media on wallraff 's supposed stasi connections . " based on our current knowledge , " marianne birthler , the head of the authority , told the newspaper die welt , a " far-reaching exoneration " of wallraff is no longer possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter wallraff die welt first reported on the connection after getting hold of information on wallraff -lrb- photo -rrb- contained on cd-roms recently released by the cia .
the so-called " rosenwood " files were seized from stasi offices during the confusing transition that followed the fall of the berlin wall .
on july 1 , the cia removed the top secret designation on the files and sent them in the form of 381 cd-roms to birthler 's office . the files allege that wallraff , operating under the code name " wagner , " passed on documents from the bundeswehr officer 's training school and the chemical company bayer ag to the stasi while working for them from 1968 to the 1970s . the accusations , if proven , could be catastrophic for the respected leftist journalist and author 's reputation . wallraff calls accusations baseless wallraff rose to fame when he worked under a false identity for bild and left to write a tell-all book on the dirty newsgathering process of the mass-circulation daily in 1977 .
in the early 1980s , he " became " ali , a turkish immigrant who had come to work in germany , and wrote a best-selling non-fiction book about his experiences . the 60-year-old rigorously denied the charges on wednesday . " the new accusations are the old accusations , only that there are more index cards , " said wallraff , who lives in cologne . most sensational story to come out of files the story is likely to be the most sensational coming out of the files , say authorities . many of the 200,000 people listed in the files were friends , colleagues or relatives of east german spies and only a small number actually worked as agents , birthler said upon the files ' release . the rosewood files are nevertheless believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .

german unemployment dipped lower in august from july , but officials said on thursday the labor market continued to stagnate as the number of people out of work remained far higher than for the same month a year ago . figures released by germany ’ s federal labor office on thursday showed unemployment in the world ’ s third largest economy dropped by around 38,000 in august from the previous month .
but with 4.313 million jobless , there were still almost 300,000 more people without work than a year earlier . chalked up to employment centers more actively pushing the unemployed for job placement , the monthly drop was larger than many economists had expected .
but the labor office warned against reading too much into the august figures and as if to highlight the “ underlying stagnation ” on labor market , the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 10.4 percent . “ we don ’ t expect an improvement of the labor market before the second quarter of 2004 and only when there ’ s an acceleration of the recovery in the second half , ” florian gerster , head of the nuremberg-based labor office , said at a press conference on thursday .
“ and even then there won ’ t suddenly be a truly mentionable amount . ” the number of unemployed in germany adjusted for seasonal factors remained unchanged in august , at 4.407 million people .
economists often put more stock in the seasonally adjusted figures because they smooth out the sharp changes that occur due to weather and holidays . five million jobless this winter ? some observers fear german joblessness could crack the five million mark this winter , when the labor market traditionally sheds jobs .
“ with the current state of the economy one has to actually assume it will be hit , ” rainer schmidt from kiel ’ s world economic institute told der spiegel magazine .

but we ’ ll certainly get close to this level . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster but the labor office ’ s gerster said the politically sensitive figure could be avoided if conditions remained favorable .
“ so long as we don ’ t have a hard winter , we ’ ll stay below five million , ” he said . with germany ’ s economy stuck in recession the first six months of 2003 , gerster and other officials are pinning their hopes on a recovery in the second half of the year .
however , even though there appear to be first signs that economy has put the worst behind it , growth this year and next are likely to be modest at best . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left coalition is betting the farm on his so-called " agenda 2010 , " a package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms aimed at reviving the lackluster economy and reducing the country ’ s chronically high unemployment .

files from the former east german secret police released by the cia two months ago suggest that one of west germany 's best-known investigative journalists may have been an informant for the stasi . he went undercover to expose the unsavory journalistic practices of germany 's largest tabloid ; he posed as " ali " to document the life of a turkish immigrant in germany during the early 1980s . if government documents from the former east germany are to be believed , it appears investigative journalist günter wallraff took on another role as well : that of a stasi spy . the head of the authority that oversees the mountains of files seized from the headquarters of the east german secret police after the collapse of the gdr confirmed on wednesday that wallraff was listed in the files as an informant in the late 1960s .
the confirmation ended years of speculation by various media on wallraff 's supposed stasi connections . " based on our current knowledge , " marianne birthler , the head of the authority , told the newspaper die welt , a " far-reaching exoneration " of wallraff is no longer possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter wallraff die welt first reported on the connection after getting hold of information on wallraff -lrb- photo -rrb- contained on cd-roms recently released by the cia .
the so-called " rosenwood " files were seized from stasi offices during the confusing transition that followed the fall of the berlin wall .
on july 1 , the cia removed the top secret designation on the files and sent them in the form of 381 cd-roms to birthler 's office . the files allege that wallraff , operating under the code name " wagner , " passed on documents from the bundeswehr officer 's training school and the chemical company bayer ag to the stasi while working for them from 1968 to the 1970s . the accusations , if proven , could be catastrophic for the respected leftist journalist and author 's reputation . wallraff calls accusations baseless wallraff rose to fame when he worked under a false identity for bild and left to write a tell-all book on the dirty newsgathering process of the mass-circulation daily in 1977 .
in the early 1980s , he " became " ali , a turkish immigrant who had come to work in germany , and wrote a best-selling non-fiction book about his experiences . the 60-year-old rigorously denied the charges on wednesday . " the new accusations are the old accusations , only that there are more index cards , " said wallraff , who lives in cologne . most sensational story to come out of files the story is likely to be the most sensational coming out of the files , say authorities . many of the 200,000 people listed in the files were friends , colleagues or relatives of east german spies and only a small number actually worked as agents , birthler said upon the files ' release . the rosewood files are nevertheless believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .
most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names . for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names , as wallraff learned on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .

the survey , based on the opinions of 8,000 people on both sides of the water , points to mixed opinions on the state of the relationship in both the u.s. and europe at a time when the two powers have seen some of the most radical shifts in their modern association .
germany sided more closely with its neighboring european allies than the united states for the first time since the end of world war ii amid rising tensions over iraq .
and , in a development that may surprise many , americans called for the european union to become a more dominant player in world affairs .
in the united states , many of those polled by the german marshall fund survey , 77 percent in fact , wanted their country to become more involved in global politics and shed its isolationist tendencies , a trait the u.s. has been saddled with since 1945 .
the gmf report that accompanied the survey said that this figure was the " highest level of support since americans were first asked the question in 1947 . "
americans support force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the invasion of iraq .
less surprisingly , however , the survey showed that a majority of u.s. participants would support the use of force to rid countries of weapons of mass destruction .
even less surprisingly , this was not a view shared by those europeans surveyed by the gmf .
it also appears that the americans are losing their enthusiasm for being the planet ’ s last remaining superpower .
last year , 52 percent were in favor of the united states maintaining that role but that figure has now decreased to 47 percent .
perhaps even more interesting is the 2 percent rise in those who want the eu to become a superpower capable of sharing the costs and risks of global problems , now at 37 percent .
the view that the eu should take on a more powerful role is supported by the europeans themselves who expressed a desire to be a partner of the u.s. rather than an entity that relies on it and is expected to do its bidding .
french , germans , italians reject strong us those europeans who support the idea of strong u.s. leadership dropped considerably in the last 12 months with 45 percent , compared to 64 percent in 2002 , in favor of a dominant america .
those who see this as desirable are mainly based in britain , the netherlands and poland where backing for such a role is strong .
the french , germans and italians , however , strongly oppose it .
majorities in europe also believe the eu - and not the us - is most vital to their national interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the eu commission romano prodi and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
shifts in germany are the most “ eye-catching , ” according to gmf .
germans are now a lot more confident about their role in global politics and demonstrate a strong preference for europe over the united states as their natural partner .
the percentage of germans who want their country to play an active role has risen to 82 percent from last year 's 65 percent , with 70 percent in favor of the eu becoming a superpower , an increase in 32 percent from 2002 .

german unemployment dipped lower in august from july , but officials said on thursday the labor market continued to stagnate as the number of people out of work remained far higher than for the same month a year ago . figures released by germany ’ s federal labor office on thursday showed unemployment in the world ’ s third largest economy dropped by around 38,000 in august from the previous month .
but with 4.313 million jobless , there were still almost 300,000 more people without work than a year earlier . chalked up to employment centers more actively pushing the unemployed for job placement , the monthly drop was larger than many economists had expected .
but the labor office warned against reading too much into the august figures and as if to highlight the “ underlying stagnation ” on labor market , the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 10.4 percent . “ we don ’ t expect an improvement of the labor market before the second quarter of 2004 and only when there ’ s an acceleration of the recovery in the second half , ” florian gerster , head of the nuremberg-based labor office , said at a press conference on thursday .
“ and even then there won ’ t suddenly be a truly mentionable amount . ” the number of unemployed in germany adjusted for seasonal factors remained unchanged in august , at 4.407 million people .
economists often put more stock in the seasonally adjusted figures because they smooth out the sharp changes that occur due to weather and holidays . five million jobless this winter ? some observers fear german joblessness could crack the five million mark this winter , when the labor market traditionally sheds jobs .
“ with the current state of the economy one has to actually assume it will be hit , ” rainer schmidt from kiel ’ s world economic institute told der spiegel magazine .
“ if job placement efforts work then maybe five million won ’ t be breached .
but we ’ ll certainly get close to this level . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster but the labor office ’ s gerster said the politically sensitive figure could be avoided if conditions remained favorable .
“ so long as we don ’ t have a hard winter , we ’ ll stay below five million , ” he said . with germany ’ s economy stuck in recession the first six months of 2003 , gerster and other officials are pinning their hopes on a recovery in the second half of the year .
however , even though there appear to be first signs that economy has put the worst behind it , growth this year and next are likely to be modest at best . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left coalition is betting the farm on his so-called " agenda 2010 , " a package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms aimed at reviving the lackluster economy and reducing the country ’ s chronically high unemployment .

in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians . a controversial proposal to give children the right to vote in national elections is drawing support from a number of influential and powerful politicians in germany .
the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .
by tapping into those below that age , the proposed bill would immediately increase the number of potential voters by 13.8 million . supporters of the bill say that allowing children to vote would help germany in the future by giving the country ’ s youth a say in the policies that will affect them in the future .
the proposal carries a statement in support of that idea : " we can only secure the future of our society , when the concept of the family is given the chance to influence politics . " “ the idea would promote discussion within the family on issues that concern the children , ” said birgit meiners , spokesperson for bundestag vice president vollmer , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ subjects such as the environment and war are already in the consciousness of children as young as six .
families could consider these and the parents could vote for the party that supports the view of the child , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents would have the vote of their children .
meiners added that , in the case of those children who could be too young to formulate opinions , putting the power of the vote into the hands of the parents would more than likely lead to the vote being cast in support of policies that would benefit the family .
however , she conceded there could be problems deciding which parent casts the child ’ s vote in situations where a couple held different political affiliations . lower the voting age ? of course , if the plan for parental power over children ’ s votes proved too problematic , other alternatives exist .
the most popular would be to lower the voting age .
“ there could be discussions of lowering the voting age to 14 in local elections and to 16 in elections where wider issues were at stake , ” meiners said . one thing is certain : if the bill were to be approved , it would give those families with more children additional voting power .
but meiners denied criticisms that the legislation might create a disadvantage for single or childless voters .
“ there is no fear that singles would be discriminated against by this bill , " meiners said . " in berlin , for example , there are more one and two person households than families .
giving the family vote will bring balance in such areas . ” still , the bill faces numerous challenges , including a required change to the basic law , germany 's constitution - a move which requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the bundestag and the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber . meiners said it would be unlikely that the decision could be taken for at least two or three years . the bill also faces some formidable opposition .
not all politicians are in favor of extending voting rights to the new born .
spd party leader franz müntefering said the voting system should not be changed and christian democratic union general secretary laurenz meyer described the proposal as " unrealistic " . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de voting with the click of a mouse casting your vote over the internet with the mere click of the mouse sounds good .

the leaders of france and germany say a new u.s. security resolution currently circulating in the united nations still does not give the organization a large enough role . at a joint press conference in dresden , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder said the new u.s. resolution calling for a u.n. role in iraq is " not dynamic enough . " the two iraq war opponents would not comment on details of the resolution , which has yet to be officially introduced and is still being worked on by the bush administration . but chirac told reporters that " the proposals … seem quite far from what appears to us to be the primary objective , namely the transfer of political responsibility to an iraqi government as soon as possible . " the draft resolution being worked on in washington reportedly keeps political power in the hands of u.s. appointee paul bremer , the country 's civilian administrator . schröder said the proposals were n't " dynamic enough , or sufficient enough . " u.n. role pivotal for other countries with the body count among u.s. and british troops rising on an almost daily level , the governments in london and washington have been scrambling to get other nations to pledge troops or involve themselves otherwise in iraq . major allies like russia , france and the arab nations have said they will only consider involvement if it is underneath a u.n. umbrella . after initially hesitating on giving the u.n. a major role in postwar iraq , the bush administration has begun to bend a bit amid increasing lawlessness and terrorism in the newly-conquered country . the draft resolution calls for a multinational force under a u.n. mandate but under the control of an american to maintain peace in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eine ehrenformation praesentiert das gewehr anlaesslich des besuchs der franzoesischen verteidigungministerin michele alliot-marie bei der deutsch-franzoesischen brigade in muellheim am donnerstag , 4 .

the leaders of france and germany say a new u.s. security resolution currently circulating in the united nations still does not give the organization a large enough role . at a joint press conference in dresden , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder said the new u.s. resolution calling for a u.n. role in iraq is " not dynamic enough . " the two iraq war opponents would not comment on details of the resolution , which has yet to be officially introduced and is still being worked on by the bush administration . but chirac told reporters that " the proposals … seem quite far from what appears to us to be the primary objective , namely the transfer of political responsibility to an iraqi government as soon as possible .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 04.09.2003 germany ponders " family vote " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german children could be facing tougher decisions in the future than where to play .
in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians . a controversial proposal to give children the right to vote in national elections is drawing support from a number of influential and powerful politicians in germany .
the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .

in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians . a controversial proposal to give children the right to vote in national elections is drawing support from a number of influential and powerful politicians in germany .
the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .

although the wine has been bottled and sold in italy for years , germany has only now officially complained since the winery is now offering its products on the internet .
according to german ard television , a wine producer from the udine region produces around 30,000 bottles a year with pictures of hitler , gestapo leader heinrich himmler , as well as italian and soviet dictators benito mussolini and josef stalin .
the hitler bottle is called “ füherwein ” and carries slogans such as “ one people , one reich , one leader . ”
nazi symbols such as swastikas and hilter ’ s book “ mein kampf ” are banned in germany . more briefs 04.09.2003 -pipe- spd says pensions hike in 2004 unlikely 04.09.2003 -pipe- court rejects ramstein compensation claim 03.09.2003 -pipe- a third of easterners miss the gdr 03.09.2003 -pipe- schröder reportedly " sickened " by greens 03.09.2003 -pipe- germany 's schröder backs turkish eu bid 03.09.2003 -pipe- court refuses to reopen eschede trial 03.09.2003 -pipe- berlin to petition court for federal aid 29.08.2003 -pipe- foreign minister criticizes u.s. policy in iraq radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german unemployment dipped lower in august from july , but officials said on thursday the labor market continued to stagnate as the number of people out of work remained far higher than for the same month a year ago . figures released by germany ’ s federal labor office on thursday showed unemployment in the world ’ s third largest economy dropped by around 38,000 in august from the previous month .
but with 4.313 million jobless , there were still almost 300,000 more people without work than a year earlier . chalked up to employment centers more actively pushing the unemployed for job placement , the monthly drop was larger than many economists had expected .
but the labor office warned against reading too much into the august figures and as if to highlight the “ underlying stagnation ” on labor market , the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 10.4 percent . “ we don ’ t expect an improvement of the labor market before the second quarter of 2004 and only when there ’ s an acceleration of the recovery in the second half , ” florian gerster , head of the nuremberg-based labor office , said at a press conference on thursday .
“ and even then there won ’ t suddenly be a truly mentionable amount . ” the number of unemployed in germany adjusted for seasonal factors remained unchanged in august , at 4.407 million people .
economists often put more stock in the seasonally adjusted figures because they smooth out the sharp changes that occur due to weather and holidays . five million jobless this winter ? some observers fear german joblessness could crack the five million mark this winter , when the labor market traditionally sheds jobs .
“ with the current state of the economy one has to actually assume it will be hit , ” rainer schmidt from kiel ’ s world economic institute told der spiegel magazine .
“ if job placement efforts work then maybe five million won ’ t be breached .
but we ’ ll certainly get close to this level . ” bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : florian gerster but the labor office ’ s gerster said the politically sensitive figure could be avoided if conditions remained favorable .
“ so long as we don ’ t have a hard winter , we ’ ll stay below five million , ” he said . with germany ’ s economy stuck in recession the first six months of 2003 , gerster and other officials are pinning their hopes on a recovery in the second half of the year .
however , even though there appear to be first signs that economy has put the worst behind it , growth this year and next are likely to be modest at best . german chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s center-left coalition is betting the farm on his so-called " agenda 2010 , " a package of welfare cuts and labor market reforms aimed at reviving the lackluster economy and reducing the country ’ s chronically high unemployment .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.09.2003 famed journalist accused of stasi ties großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the berlin office where stasi files are piled to the ceiling , just waiting to incriminate someone .
files from the former east german secret police released by the cia two months ago suggest that one of west germany 's best-known investigative journalists may have been an informant for the stasi . he went undercover to expose the unsavory journalistic practices of germany 's largest tabloid ; he posed as " ali " to document the life of a turkish immigrant in germany during the early 1980s . if government documents from the former east germany are to be believed , it appears investigative journalist günter wallraff took on another role as well : that of a stasi spy . the head of the authority that oversees the mountains of files seized from the headquarters of the east german secret police after the collapse of the gdr confirmed on wednesday that wallraff was listed in the files as an informant in the late 1960s .
the confirmation ended years of speculation by various media on wallraff 's supposed stasi connections . " based on our current knowledge , " marianne birthler , the head of the authority , told the newspaper die welt , a " far-reaching exoneration " of wallraff is no longer possible . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guenter wallraff die welt first reported on the connection after getting hold of information on wallraff -lrb- photo -rrb- contained on cd-roms recently released by the cia .
the so-called " rosenwood " files were seized from stasi offices during the confusing transition that followed the fall of the berlin wall .
on july 1 , the cia removed the top secret designation on the files and sent them in the form of 381 cd-roms to birthler 's office . the files allege that wallraff , operating under the code name " wagner , " passed on documents from the bundeswehr officer 's training school and the chemical company bayer ag to the stasi while working for them from 1968 to the 1970s . the accusations , if proven , could be catastrophic for the respected leftist journalist and author 's reputation . wallraff calls accusations baseless wallraff rose to fame when he worked under a false identity for bild and left to write a tell-all book on the dirty newsgathering process of the mass-circulation daily in 1977 .
in the early 1980s , he " became " ali , a turkish immigrant who had come to work in germany , and wrote a best-selling non-fiction book about his experiences . the 60-year-old rigorously denied the charges on wednesday . " the new accusations are the old accusations , only that there are more index cards , " said wallraff , who lives in cologne . most sensational story to come out of files the story is likely to be the most sensational coming out of the files , say authorities . many of the 200,000 people listed in the files were friends , colleagues or relatives of east german spies and only a small number actually worked as agents , birthler said upon the files ' release . the rosewood files are nevertheless believed to fill in a crucial gap in the extensive investigations of stasi activities carried out by german authorities so far .
most stasi documents seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names . for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the code names , as wallraff learned on thursday . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .

the survey , based on the opinions of 8,000 people on both sides of the water , points to mixed opinions on the state of the relationship in both the u.s. and europe at a time when the two powers have seen some of the most radical shifts in their modern association .
germany sided more closely with its neighboring european allies than the united states for the first time since the end of world war ii amid rising tensions over iraq .
and , in a development that may surprise many , americans called for the european union to become a more dominant player in world affairs .
in the united states , many of those polled by the german marshall fund survey , 77 percent in fact , wanted their country to become more involved in global politics and shed its isolationist tendencies , a trait the u.s. has been saddled with since 1945 .
the gmf report that accompanied the survey said that this figure was the " highest level of support since americans were first asked the question in 1947 . "
americans support force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the invasion of iraq .
less surprisingly , however , the survey showed that a majority of u.s. participants would support the use of force to rid countries of weapons of mass destruction .
even less surprisingly , this was not a view shared by those europeans surveyed by the gmf .
it also appears that the americans are losing their enthusiasm for being the planet ’ s last remaining superpower .
last year , 52 percent were in favor of the united states maintaining that role but that figure has now decreased to 47 percent .
perhaps even more interesting is the 2 percent rise in those who want the eu to become a superpower capable of sharing the costs and risks of global problems , now at 37 percent .
the view that the eu should take on a more powerful role is supported by the europeans themselves who expressed a desire to be a partner of the u.s. rather than an entity that relies on it and is expected to do its bidding .
french , germans , italians reject strong us those europeans who support the idea of strong u.s. leadership dropped considerably in the last 12 months with 45 percent , compared to 64 percent in 2002 , in favor of a dominant america .
those who see this as desirable are mainly based in britain , the netherlands and poland where backing for such a role is strong .
the french , germans and italians , however , strongly oppose it .
majorities in europe also believe the eu - and not the us - is most vital to their national interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the eu commission romano prodi and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
shifts in germany are the most “ eye-catching , ” according to gmf .
germans are now a lot more confident about their role in global politics and demonstrate a strong preference for europe over the united states as their natural partner .
the percentage of germans who want their country to play an active role has risen to 82 percent from last year 's 65 percent , with 70 percent in favor of the eu becoming a superpower , an increase in 32 percent from 2002 .

the survey , based on the opinions of 8,000 people on both sides of the water , points to mixed opinions on the state of the relationship in both the u.s. and europe at a time when the two powers have seen some of the most radical shifts in their modern association .
germany sided more closely with its neighboring european allies than the united states for the first time since the end of world war ii amid rising tensions over iraq .
and , in a development that may surprise many , americans called for the european union to become a more dominant player in world affairs .
in the united states , many of those polled by the german marshall fund survey , 77 percent in fact , wanted their country to become more involved in global politics and shed its isolationist tendencies , a trait the u.s. has been saddled with since 1945 .
the gmf report that accompanied the survey said that this figure was the " highest level of support since americans were first asked the question in 1947 . "
americans support force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the invasion of iraq .
less surprisingly , however , the survey showed that a majority of u.s. participants would support the use of force to rid countries of weapons of mass destruction .
even less surprisingly , this was not a view shared by those europeans surveyed by the gmf .
it also appears that the americans are losing their enthusiasm for being the planet ’ s last remaining superpower .
last year , 52 percent were in favor of the united states maintaining that role but that figure has now decreased to 47 percent .
perhaps even more interesting is the 2 percent rise in those who want the eu to become a superpower capable of sharing the costs and risks of global problems , now at 37 percent .
the view that the eu should take on a more powerful role is supported by the europeans themselves who expressed a desire to be a partner of the u.s. rather than an entity that relies on it and is expected to do its bidding .

in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians . a controversial proposal to give children the right to vote in national elections is drawing support from a number of influential and powerful politicians in germany .
the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .
by tapping into those below that age , the proposed bill would immediately increase the number of potential voters by 13.8 million . supporters of the bill say that allowing children to vote would help germany in the future by giving the country ’ s youth a say in the policies that will affect them in the future .
the proposal carries a statement in support of that idea : " we can only secure the future of our society , when the concept of the family is given the chance to influence politics . " “ the idea would promote discussion within the family on issues that concern the children , ” said birgit meiners , spokesperson for bundestag vice president vollmer , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ subjects such as the environment and war are already in the consciousness of children as young as six .
families could consider these and the parents could vote for the party that supports the view of the child , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents would have the vote of their children .
meiners added that , in the case of those children who could be too young to formulate opinions , putting the power of the vote into the hands of the parents would more than likely lead to the vote being cast in support of policies that would benefit the family .
however , she conceded there could be problems deciding which parent casts the child ’ s vote in situations where a couple held different political affiliations . lower the voting age ? of course , if the plan for parental power over children ’ s votes proved too problematic , other alternatives exist .
the most popular would be to lower the voting age .
“ there could be discussions of lowering the voting age to 14 in local elections and to 16 in elections where wider issues were at stake , ” meiners said . one thing is certain : if the bill were to be approved , it would give those families with more children additional voting power .
but meiners denied criticisms that the legislation might create a disadvantage for single or childless voters .
“ there is no fear that singles would be discriminated against by this bill , " meiners said . " in berlin , for example , there are more one and two person households than families .
giving the family vote will bring balance in such areas . ” still , the bill faces numerous challenges , including a required change to the basic law , germany 's constitution - a move which requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the bundestag and the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber . meiners said it would be unlikely that the decision could be taken for at least two or three years . the bill also faces some formidable opposition .
not all politicians are in favor of extending voting rights to the new born .

in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians . a controversial proposal to give children the right to vote in national elections is drawing support from a number of influential and powerful politicians in germany .
the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .
by tapping into those below that age , the proposed bill would immediately increase the number of potential voters by 13.8 million . supporters of the bill say that allowing children to vote would help germany in the future by giving the country ’ s youth a say in the policies that will affect them in the future .
the proposal carries a statement in support of that idea : " we can only secure the future of our society , when the concept of the family is given the chance to influence politics . " “ the idea would promote discussion within the family on issues that concern the children , ” said birgit meiners , spokesperson for bundestag vice president vollmer , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ subjects such as the environment and war are already in the consciousness of children as young as six .
families could consider these and the parents could vote for the party that supports the view of the child , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents would have the vote of their children .
meiners added that , in the case of those children who could be too young to formulate opinions , putting the power of the vote into the hands of the parents would more than likely lead to the vote being cast in support of policies that would benefit the family .
however , she conceded there could be problems deciding which parent casts the child ’ s vote in situations where a couple held different political affiliations . lower the voting age ? of course , if the plan for parental power over children ’ s votes proved too problematic , other alternatives exist .
the most popular would be to lower the voting age .
“ there could be discussions of lowering the voting age to 14 in local elections and to 16 in elections where wider issues were at stake , ” meiners said . one thing is certain : if the bill were to be approved , it would give those families with more children additional voting power .
but meiners denied criticisms that the legislation might create a disadvantage for single or childless voters .
“ there is no fear that singles would be discriminated against by this bill , " meiners said . " in berlin , for example , there are more one and two person households than families .
giving the family vote will bring balance in such areas . ” still , the bill faces numerous challenges , including a required change to the basic law , germany 's constitution - a move which requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the bundestag and the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber . meiners said it would be unlikely that the decision could be taken for at least two or three years . the bill also faces some formidable opposition .
not all politicians are in favor of extending voting rights to the new born .
spd party leader franz müntefering said the voting system should not be changed and christian democratic union general secretary laurenz meyer described the proposal as " unrealistic " . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de voting with the click of a mouse casting your vote over the internet with the mere click of the mouse sounds good .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 04.09.2003 little relief in sight for ailing german labor market großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nearly 300,000 more germans were looking for work in august compared to a year ago .
german unemployment dipped lower in august from july , but officials said on thursday the labor market continued to stagnate as the number of people out of work remained far higher than for the same month a year ago . figures released by germany ’ s federal labor office on thursday showed unemployment in the world ’ s third largest economy dropped by around 38,000 in august from the previous month .
but with 4.313 million jobless , there were still almost 300,000 more people without work than a year earlier . chalked up to employment centers more actively pushing the unemployed for job placement , the monthly drop was larger than many economists had expected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.09.2003 survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a while since washington has been close to berlin a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many . a survey released this week by the german marshall fund of the united states -lrb- gmf -rrb- shows an interesting insight into the views of americans and europeans as relations between the transatlantic partners continue to ebb and flow .
the survey , based on the opinions of 8,000 people on both sides of the water , points to mixed opinions on the state of the relationship in both the u.s. and europe at a time when the two powers have seen some of the most radical shifts in their modern association .
germany sided more closely with its neighboring european allies than the united states for the first time since the end of world war ii amid rising tensions over iraq .
and , in a development that may surprise many , americans called for the european union to become a more dominant player in world affairs .
in the united states , many of those polled by the german marshall fund survey , 77 percent in fact , wanted their country to become more involved in global politics and shed its isolationist tendencies , a trait the u.s. has been saddled with since 1945 .
the gmf report that accompanied the survey said that this figure was the " highest level of support since americans were first asked the question in 1947 . "
americans support force bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the invasion of iraq .
less surprisingly , however , the survey showed that a majority of u.s. participants would support the use of force to rid countries of weapons of mass destruction .
even less surprisingly , this was not a view shared by those europeans surveyed by the gmf .
it also appears that the americans are losing their enthusiasm for being the planet ’ s last remaining superpower .
last year , 52 percent were in favor of the united states maintaining that role but that figure has now decreased to 47 percent .
perhaps even more interesting is the 2 percent rise in those who want the eu to become a superpower capable of sharing the costs and risks of global problems , now at 37 percent .
the view that the eu should take on a more powerful role is supported by the europeans themselves who expressed a desire to be a partner of the u.s. rather than an entity that relies on it and is expected to do its bidding .
french , germans , italians reject strong us those europeans who support the idea of strong u.s. leadership dropped considerably in the last 12 months with 45 percent , compared to 64 percent in 2002 , in favor of a dominant america .
those who see this as desirable are mainly based in britain , the netherlands and poland where backing for such a role is strong .
the french , germans and italians , however , strongly oppose it .
majorities in europe also believe the eu - and not the us - is most vital to their national interests .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president of the eu commission romano prodi and german chancellor gerhard schröder .
shifts in germany are the most “ eye-catching , ” according to gmf .
germans are now a lot more confident about their role in global politics and demonstrate a strong preference for europe over the united states as their natural partner .
the percentage of germans who want their country to play an active role has risen to 82 percent from last year 's 65 percent , with 70 percent in favor of the eu becoming a superpower , an increase in 32 percent from 2002 .
however , that figure would drop to 36 percent if becoming a superpower meant european countries spending more on defense . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : transatlantic rapprochement following eu-u.s. summit europe and the united states are slowly smoothing out their troubled relations originating from the iraq conflict .

the leaders of france and germany say a new u.s. security resolution currently circulating in the united nations still does not give the organization a large enough role . at a joint press conference in dresden , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder said the new u.s. resolution calling for a u.n. role in iraq is " not dynamic enough . " the two iraq war opponents would not comment on details of the resolution , which has yet to be officially introduced and is still being worked on by the bush administration . but chirac told reporters that " the proposals … seem quite far from what appears to us to be the primary objective , namely the transfer of political responsibility to an iraqi government as soon as possible . " the draft resolution being worked on in washington reportedly keeps political power in the hands of u.s. appointee paul bremer , the country 's civilian administrator . schröder said the proposals were n't " dynamic enough , or sufficient enough . " u.n. role pivotal for other countries with the body count among u.s. and british troops rising on an almost daily level , the governments in london and washington have been scrambling to get other nations to pledge troops or involve themselves otherwise in iraq . major allies like russia , france and the arab nations have said they will only consider involvement if it is underneath a u.n. umbrella . after initially hesitating on giving the u.n. a major role in postwar iraq , the bush administration has begun to bend a bit amid increasing lawlessness and terrorism in the newly-conquered country . the draft resolution calls for a multinational force under a u.n. mandate but under the control of an american to maintain peace in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eine ehrenformation praesentiert das gewehr anlaesslich des besuchs der franzoesischen verteidigungministerin michele alliot-marie bei der deutsch-franzoesischen brigade in muellheim am donnerstag , 4 .

-lrb- ap photo / winfried rothermel -rrb- government officials of the two european powers said they are willing to work with the u.s. proposal . germany : still no iraq troops whatever the differences in the past , the point now is about " giving iraq and stability and democratic perspective , " said schröder . but german government politicians maintained that they would not send bundeswehr troops to iraq , even under a u.n. mandate . " from our view , we 've contributed so far with humanitarian aid , " olaf scholz , the general secretary of schröder 's social democratic party told german radio .

the leaders of france and germany say a new u.s. security resolution currently circulating in the united nations still does not give the organization a large enough role . at a joint press conference in dresden , french president jacques chirac and german chancellor gerhard schröder said the new u.s. resolution calling for a u.n. role in iraq is " not dynamic enough . " the two iraq war opponents would not comment on details of the resolution , which has yet to be officially introduced and is still being worked on by the bush administration . but chirac told reporters that " the proposals … seem quite far from what appears to us to be the primary objective , namely the transfer of political responsibility to an iraqi government as soon as possible . " the draft resolution being worked on in washington reportedly keeps political power in the hands of u.s. appointee paul bremer , the country 's civilian administrator . schröder said the proposals were n't " dynamic enough , or sufficient enough . " u.n. role pivotal for other countries with the body count among u.s. and british troops rising on an almost daily level , the governments in london and washington have been scrambling to get other nations to pledge troops or involve themselves otherwise in iraq . major allies like russia , france and the arab nations have said they will only consider involvement if it is underneath a u.n. umbrella . after initially hesitating on giving the u.n. a major role in postwar iraq , the bush administration has begun to bend a bit amid increasing lawlessness and terrorism in the newly-conquered country . the draft resolution calls for a multinational force under a u.n. mandate but under the control of an american to maintain peace in iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eine ehrenformation praesentiert das gewehr anlaesslich des besuchs der franzoesischen verteidigungministerin michele alliot-marie bei der deutsch-franzoesischen brigade in muellheim am donnerstag , 4 .

" it is now time to adjust to the new situation in iraq , " the paper wrote .
it would be in the international community ’ s interest to " put out the fire that is iraq as quickly as possible . " the moscow-based daily kommersant had a different take on things .
it wrote that since the united states went to war without u.n. support , it should settle the mess on its own . corriere della sera was more conciliatory .
the italian paper said a new u.n. resolution would be necessary to get countries such as india , bangladesh and turkey to commit troops to iraq . the financial times cautioned countries that were against the war from sending troops now on the basis of a new resolution .
" the opponents of u.s. action in iraq face an unenviable choice , " the london-based paper wrote .
if they agreed to a u.n. role and took part in a postwar clean-up they would have - in the end - done america ’ s bidding . the french daily libération agreed .
" under what conditions should a country allow itself to get involved in such an adventure - especially countries that were so dead-set against sending in troops from the beginning ? " it asked .
still , it reminded sceptics , it would be irresponsible to just sit around and do nothing . another issue of editorials was the crisis in the middle east .
the swiss tages-anzeiger criticized both palestinian prime minister abbas and the israelis for not living up to their sides of the bargain in working to bring peace to the region .
both agreed to the peace plan , but in practice they were not helping to improve the situation , the paper said .
prime minister abbas still hadn ’ t done enough to disband palestinian terror groups and the israelis continued to build settlements , it said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but the labor office warned against reading too much into the august figures and as if to highlight the “ underlying stagnation ” on labor market , the unemployment rate remained unchanged at 10.4 percent . “ we don ’ t expect an improvement of the labor market before the second quarter of 2004 and only when there ’ s an acceleration of the recovery in the second half , ” florian gerster , head of the nuremberg-based labor office , said at a press conference on thursday .

in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians . a controversial proposal to give children the right to vote in national elections is drawing support from a number of influential and powerful politicians in germany .
the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .
by tapping into those below that age , the proposed bill would immediately increase the number of potential voters by 13.8 million . supporters of the bill say that allowing children to vote would help germany in the future by giving the country ’ s youth a say in the policies that will affect them in the future .
the proposal carries a statement in support of that idea : " we can only secure the future of our society , when the concept of the family is given the chance to influence politics . " “ the idea would promote discussion within the family on issues that concern the children , ” said birgit meiners , spokesperson for bundestag vice president vollmer , in an interview with deutsche welle .
“ subjects such as the environment and war are already in the consciousness of children as young as six .
families could consider these and the parents could vote for the party that supports the view of the child , ” she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : parents would have the vote of their children .
meiners added that , in the case of those children who could be too young to formulate opinions , putting the power of the vote into the hands of the parents would more than likely lead to the vote being cast in support of policies that would benefit the family .
however , she conceded there could be problems deciding which parent casts the child ’ s vote in situations where a couple held different political affiliations . lower the voting age ? of course , if the plan for parental power over children ’ s votes proved too problematic , other alternatives exist .
the most popular would be to lower the voting age .
“ there could be discussions of lowering the voting age to 14 in local elections and to 16 in elections where wider issues were at stake , ” meiners said . one thing is certain : if the bill were to be approved , it would give those families with more children additional voting power .
but meiners denied criticisms that the legislation might create a disadvantage for single or childless voters .
“ there is no fear that singles would be discriminated against by this bill , " meiners said . " in berlin , for example , there are more one and two person households than families .
giving the family vote will bring balance in such areas . ” still , the bill faces numerous challenges , including a required change to the basic law , germany 's constitution - a move which requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the bundestag and the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber . meiners said it would be unlikely that the decision could be taken for at least two or three years . the bill also faces some formidable opposition .
not all politicians are in favor of extending voting rights to the new born .

under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .
children aged 12 and above would hold the right to refuse their parents permission to vote on their behalf by formally informing the state of their decision to rescind the power . “ if it is written in the constitution that all power goes to the people , then children must also be given the right to vote , ” the text of the bill reads . it continues to say that those who have put forward the bill , and those who support it , believe it is “ unjust that every fifth german is excluded from voting in elections . ” currently , the voting age in germany is 18 .
by tapping into those below that age , the proposed bill would immediately increase the number of potential voters by 13.8 million . supporters of the bill say that allowing children to vote would help germany in the future by giving the country ’ s youth a say in the policies that will affect them in the future .
the proposal carries a statement in support of that idea : " we can only secure the future of our society , when the concept of the family is given the chance to influence politics . " “ the idea would promote discussion within the family on issues that concern the children , ” said birgit meiners , spokesperson for bundestag vice president vollmer , in an interview with deutsche welle .

meiners added that , in the case of those children who could be too young to formulate opinions , putting the power of the vote into the hands of the parents would more than likely lead to the vote being cast in support of policies that would benefit the family .
however , she conceded there could be problems deciding which parent casts the child ’ s vote in situations where a couple held different political affiliations . lower the voting age ? of course , if the plan for parental power over children ’ s votes proved too problematic , other alternatives exist .
the most popular would be to lower the voting age .
“ there could be discussions of lowering the voting age to 14 in local elections and to 16 in elections where wider issues were at stake , ” meiners said . one thing is certain : if the bill were to be approved , it would give those families with more children additional voting power .
but meiners denied criticisms that the legislation might create a disadvantage for single or childless voters .
“ there is no fear that singles would be discriminated against by this bill , " meiners said . " in berlin , for example , there are more one and two person households than families .
giving the family vote will bring balance in such areas . ” still , the bill faces numerous challenges , including a required change to the basic law , germany 's constitution - a move which requires a two-thirds majority vote in both the bundestag and the bundesrat , the country 's upper legislative chamber . meiners said it would be unlikely that the decision could be taken for at least two or three years . the bill also faces some formidable opposition .

in an attempt to pass some of the responsibility of germany 's political future to those who will have to face it , a plan to give children the vote has been proposed and supported by a number of politicians . a controversial proposal to give children the right to vote in national elections is drawing support from a number of influential and powerful politicians in germany .
the legislation , which is slated for introduction to parliament in autumn , would place a child ’ s vote in the trust of parents until it is of an “ able age . ” the issue has attracted the support of a number of the german parliament ’ s top politicians , including parliamentary president wolfgang thierse of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- and vice president antje vollmer of the green party .
minister for family affairs renate schmidt -lrb- spd -rrb- has also voiced her support for the so-called " family voting rights . "
even constitutional lawyers seem to be in agreement that family voting could actually benefit germany .
former german chancellor and president of the federal constitutional court , roman herzog , has said he views the proposal favorably . however , none of the major parties have come out in full support of the plan and it remains a labor of love for a handful of individuals only .
but the bill 's drafters , klaus haupt , a neo-liberal from the free democratic party and his colleague , hermann otto solms , are continuing to build support for the legislation . every fifth german excluded from elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maybe joschka will be lucky if the kids like green .
under the plan , parents of children between the ages of 0-12 would have the right to cast the vote of their children in elections .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 04.09.2003 survey shows europeans ' distrust of u.s. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's been a while since washington has been close to berlin a poll carried out on both sides of the atlantic by the german marshall fund finds that american and european views on the transatlantic relationship have changed during the past year in ways likely to surprise many . a survey released this week by the german marshall fund of the united states -lrb- gmf -rrb- shows an interesting insight into the views of americans and europeans as relations between the transatlantic partners continue to ebb and flow .
the survey , based on the opinions of 8,000 people on both sides of the water , points to mixed opinions on the state of the relationship in both the u.s. and europe at a time when the two powers have seen some of the most radical shifts in their modern association .
germany sided more closely with its neighboring european allies than the united states for the first time since the end of world war ii amid rising tensions over iraq .
and , in a development that may surprise many , americans called for the european union to become a more dominant player in world affairs .
in the united states , many of those polled by the german marshall fund survey , 77 percent in fact , wanted their country to become more involved in global politics and shed its isolationist tendencies , a trait the u.s. has been saddled with since 1945 .

the county council says it will back proposals to disband lancashire 's 12 district councils and create a single council for the whole area .
it has come up with the plan because the government has decided there can be only one tier of local government if people vote for a regional assembly next year .
but the county 's other councils look set to oppose the plan .
grouping together if regional government is given the go-ahead , lancashire county council could face abolition , says the bbc 's north west political correspondent jim hancock .
he said district councils are planning on grouping together to form three or four unitary councils to run all the services .
ribble valley council has already signalled it will oppose the county council 's plans .
the government will make proposals for the future local government map in the county in december .

in a new report , the general teaching council for wales says a recruitment drive is needed to avoid future problems with teacher shortages .
the council has made 65 recommendations , including the introduction of more family-friendly hours and action to deal with pupil misbehaviour , which , it claims , deters many people from becoming teachers .
a third of all teachers and two thirds of headteachers in wales will reach retirement age in the next 10 years , meaning 11,000 new staff are needed to replace them .
but the council says that the perception of teaching as a profession with a high workload and problems with pupil discipline put many potential recruits off a career in the classroom .
paul rees has retrained as a maths teacher the problem is particularly bad in physics , maths and welsh teaching , while a severe shortage of male teachers in primary schools means men now account for just 17 % of staff in that sector .
to combat the potential recruitment crisis , the council says it wants to see a change in the kind of people coming into the profession .
the report says that more minority groups and older recruits should be encouraged into teaching .
the council added that teaching should offer more flexibility and childcare support for parents returning to the classroom .
' real buzz ' one new recruit to teaching from another profession is maths teacher paul rees , who has this week begun his new job at whitchurch high school , in cardiff .
a year ago , he was a manufacturing manager for an it firm before training as a maths teacher - a subject in which there is a shortage of teachers .
" the discipline has been far better than i had expected in school , " he said .
" it 's really nice teaching kids , getting them to learn things and , when they understand something , that gives you a real thrill and a real buzz . "
falling birthrate the general teaching council for wales ' recruitment call comes against a backdrop of teacher redundancies in welsh schools .
in july , it was announced that more than 200 teaching jobs would be lost by the end of the year .
figures from the 22 welsh local authorities showed that 246 teachers would either be made redundant , take voluntary redundancy or accept early retirement packages .
one of the reasons given for the cuts was the falling birthrate in wales .
about 75 % of school funding is determined by the number of children attending schools , and a reduction in pupils brings a cut in the number of teachers .
but , in its report , the general teaching council for wales said that the projected fall in the welsh birth rate should be used as a " major opportunity " to reduce class sizes by maintaining teacher numbers at their current level .

in a new report , the general teaching council for wales says a recruitment drive is needed to avoid future problems with teacher shortages .
the council has made 65 recommendations , including the introduction of more family-friendly hours and action to deal with pupil misbehaviour , which , it claims , deters many people from becoming teachers .
a third of all teachers and two thirds of headteachers in wales will reach retirement age in the next 10 years , meaning 11,000 new staff are needed to replace them .
but the council says that the perception of teaching as a profession with a high workload and problems with pupil discipline put many potential recruits off a career in the classroom .
paul rees has retrained as a maths teacher the problem is particularly bad in physics , maths and welsh teaching , while a severe shortage of male teachers in primary schools means men now account for just 17 % of staff in that sector .
to combat the potential recruitment crisis , the council says it wants to see a change in the kind of people coming into the profession .
the report says that more minority groups and older recruits should be encouraged into teaching .
the council added that teaching should offer more flexibility and childcare support for parents returning to the classroom .
' real buzz ' one new recruit to teaching from another profession is maths teacher paul rees , who has this week begun his new job at whitchurch high school , in cardiff .
a year ago , he was a manufacturing manager for an it firm before training as a maths teacher - a subject in which there is a shortage of teachers .
" the discipline has been far better than i had expected in school , " he said .
" it 's really nice teaching kids , getting them to learn things and , when they understand something , that gives you a real thrill and a real buzz . "
falling birthrate the general teaching council for wales ' recruitment call comes against a backdrop of teacher redundancies in welsh schools .
in july , it was announced that more than 200 teaching jobs would be lost by the end of the year .
figures from the 22 welsh local authorities showed that 246 teachers would either be made redundant , take voluntary redundancy or accept early retirement packages .
one of the reasons given for the cuts was the falling birthrate in wales .
about 75 % of school funding is determined by the number of children attending schools , and a reduction in pupils brings a cut in the number of teachers .
but , in its report , the general teaching council for wales said that the projected fall in the welsh birth rate should be used as a " major opportunity " to reduce class sizes by maintaining teacher numbers at their current level .

blackball follows the story of griff sanders , who was banned from the green for a decade after swearing during a championship .
the film was shot in torbay and premiered in paignton last week .
mr sanders , now 30 , was 25 and an england international when he was banned from competitive outdoor lawn bowls events by the devon county bowling association .
he successfully appealed against the ban in 1999 .
his offences included rolling cigarettes , drinking lager and once playing an end while eating a bag of chips .
he also wrote a derogatory comment on his scorecard about the secretary of a bowling club .
the film is directed by mel smith and stars many of britain 's top comedians , including paul kaye and johnny vegas .
filming took place in torquay in 2002 , and it is hoped shots of the resort will bring a boost to the tourism industry .
