files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .
but bisky denies he worked as an official stasi informant . shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was able to get it hands on hundreds of files belonging to the east german secret police known at the stasi .
over the last three years , the so-called “ rosewood ” files were copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany . since the beginning of july , the documents have been available for public research .
bisky , listed as “ unofficial collaborator ” at the foreign section of the east germany ministry for security , is the first high-profile person to be implicated by the rosewood files . the 61 year-old politician admitted on tuesday he had contact to the secret police but denied he worked as a stasi informant .
he told german ard television there was “ nothing new ” in the latest revelations and that he was only of interest to east german authorities because of his travel abroad . “ i wrote the usual travel reports about my trips to the west for my supervisors and passed them on , ” bisky said .
he said he never signed any documents , which would be required to be a stasi informant . the news couldn ’ t have come at a worse time for bisky , who was re-elected in june to lead the beleaguered party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which rose from the ashes of the east german communist party after german reunification .
bisky headed the pds 1993 to 2000 , but was called back to duty as the party has floundered in recent months .
considered part of the party ’ s more pragmatic wing , being listed in the rosewood files could hurt his effort to get the pds back on track . codename “ bienitz ” according to the weekly newspaper die zeit , bisky , who emigrated from west germany to the communist east in 1959 , worked under the codename “ bienitz ” for the stasi from 1966 to 1979 .
he was then “ reactivated ” in 1986 after he became the director of the once-famous film school in babelsberg near berlin . günter nooke , a conservative member of the german parliament , came to bisky ’ s defense on wednesday , saying as a member of a government investigative committee in the 1990s he had known for years about bisky ’ s connections to the stasi .
nooke told the berliner zeitung newspaper the latest details were “ not spectacular enough ” to endanger bisky ’ s political career . although officials tending the rosewood files have warned there will likely be few sensational revelations from the documents , they should fill in some crucial gaps in the extensive investigations of stasi activities .
most files seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the codenames . officials believe that of the some 200,000 names included on the card index , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 are east germans who worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west . after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
but as some documents came to light after 1990 , many stasi informers were outted , leading to bitter recriminations among co-workers , neighbors and even family members .
millions of people are estimated to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .
the secret police often used draconian methods to persuade or intimidating ordinary people to spy on their neighbors and friends . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies the cia recently handed over sensitive files that name thousands of former east german secret service agents to germany .

you might not be winning the yellow jersey just yet , but cycling can still be a rewarding experience .
a tour by the rhine offers many delights - all taking a fraction of the energy needed to win the tour de france . if the tour de france is still a little out of your league , then why not try the tour de rhine ?
we ’ re not talking about competitive cycling here , but a leisurely ride down germany ’ s most famous river , taking in the historic roman city of cologne , the former cold war capital of bonn and finishing with a well-earned break in koblenz , at the cross roads of the rhine and mosel . and if pleasant cycling is the order of the day but you still secretly fancy yourself as the next jan ullrich or lance armstrong , then you can always take in the sights dressed head to toe in luminous lycra – many do . after all cycling is seriously good fun in germany , with the emphasis on " seriously . "
germany is a country where leisure is not just a business or pastime , but a fundamental right of the people . one set of leisure seekers that benefits most from this fact are the cyclists .
those enjoying the winding paths of the rhineland area are blessed with a total of 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- of paved , maintained and meticulously-routed cycle highways which snake around and bisect the countryside .
save for a few close calls with nearby autobahns , this route , like most of them in germany , takes in hill and dale , river and stream and , of course , the odd beer garden .
in the footseps of caesar and attila the hun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling means family fun in germany .
as with most things in germany , cycling has its own order .
many routes offer an infrastructure of signs which highlight places of interest for those who don ’ t want to miss anything out .
the route along the rhine is no exception with its romantic vistas and historical legacies .
the paths follow in the sandaled footsteps of julius caesar and his legions who settled along the river at cologne , bonn , nierstein and koblenz , while attila the hun 's butchery hereabouts earned him the nom de guerre " the scourge of god . "
the timbered houses in the cobblestone villages along these banks also witnessed the great plague and the thirty years war .
from time to time , these banks also experience flooding - something to bear in mind before setting out .
beginning the tour in cologne , you have the luxurious choice of two well signposted paths on either side of the river .
taking the “ schäl sick ” or " wrong " side of the river -lrb- that which does not play host to the city center ’ s delights -rrb- is actually the more attractive option to start with as the " right " side takes the koblenz bound cyclist along a number of main auto routes . sooner or later , however , the woods , parks and picturesque watering holes have to be left behind as the route on the “ schäl sick ” comes to an end .
taking one of the small ferries across the rhine , the path continues down to bonn .
wine and legend in the valleys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because cycling should n't be your only pleasure .
crossing the kennedybrücke , the bridge named after john f. kennedy , the tour takes in the opera house and concert hall in bonn , the birthplace of ludwig von beethoven and the post-war german republic .
onwards , the route offers a superb view of the castled crags of the drachenfels , where siegfried in richard wagner ’ s ring saga slayed a dragon and bathed in its blood to make himself invincible .
further on , as the route winds into koblenz , fans of the grape can view the region ’ s vineyards and try the local tipple .
although just one of many bike tours available to enthusiasts visiting the country , the cologne – koblenz route offers a good selection of all that 's good about leisurely cycling in germany : beautiful scenery , historic sights , mythical stories and the opportunity to take a break and sample the great beer , wine and food .
after all , it ’ s not a race . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de biking the iron curtain broke stereotypes for german athlete from norway to greece , frank hülsemann traced 4,000 kilometers -lrb- 2,485 miles -rrb- of the former iron curtain on his mountain bike .

files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .
but bisky denies he worked as an official stasi informant . shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was able to get it hands on hundreds of files belonging to the east german secret police known at the stasi .
over the last three years , the so-called “ rosewood ” files were copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany . since the beginning of july , the documents have been available for public research .
bisky , listed as “ unofficial collaborator ” at the foreign section of the east germany ministry for security , is the first high-profile person to be implicated by the rosewood files . the 61 year-old politician admitted on tuesday he had contact to the secret police but denied he worked as a stasi informant .
he told german ard television there was “ nothing new ” in the latest revelations and that he was only of interest to east german authorities because of his travel abroad . “ i wrote the usual travel reports about my trips to the west for my supervisors and passed them on , ” bisky said .
he said he never signed any documents , which would be required to be a stasi informant . the news couldn ’ t have come at a worse time for bisky , who was re-elected in june to lead the beleaguered party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which rose from the ashes of the east german communist party after german reunification .
bisky headed the pds 1993 to 2000 , but was called back to duty as the party has floundered in recent months .
considered part of the party ’ s more pragmatic wing , being listed in the rosewood files could hurt his effort to get the pds back on track . codename “ bienitz ” according to the weekly newspaper die zeit , bisky , who emigrated from west germany to the communist east in 1959 , worked under the codename “ bienitz ” for the stasi from 1966 to 1979 .
he was then “ reactivated ” in 1986 after he became the director of the once-famous film school in babelsberg near berlin . günter nooke , a conservative member of the german parliament , came to bisky ’ s defense on wednesday , saying as a member of a government investigative committee in the 1990s he had known for years about bisky ’ s connections to the stasi .
nooke told the berliner zeitung newspaper the latest details were “ not spectacular enough ” to endanger bisky ’ s political career . although officials tending the rosewood files have warned there will likely be few sensational revelations from the documents , they should fill in some crucial gaps in the extensive investigations of stasi activities .
most files seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the codenames . officials believe that of the some 200,000 names included on the card index , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 are east germans who worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west . after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
but as some documents came to light after 1990 , many stasi informers were outted , leading to bitter recriminations among co-workers , neighbors and even family members .
millions of people are estimated to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .
the secret police often used draconian methods to persuade or intimidating ordinary people to spy on their neighbors and friends . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies the cia recently handed over sensitive files that name thousands of former east german secret service agents to germany .
the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies .
-lrb- july 9 , 2003 -rrb- back to the future for germany ’ s socialists germany ’ s struggling socialist pds , the successor party to east germany 's communists , has elected a new leader .
the ballot came after an ongoing internal power struggle caused former leader gabi zimmer to step down .

starting next year patients in germany will be spared a trip to the pharmacy since they 'll be able to get their prescriptions filled online and mailed to them .
pharmacy groups warn it could endanger patients ' health . proponents of the legalization of mail-order medicine say it has one major advantage - it will lower the costs of health care . patients clicking online to fill prescriptions should pay 10 to 30 percent less for drugs , according to dr. peter weber , who already runs an online pharmacy offering around 10,000 products - mostly vitamins and cough drops , since " real " medicines ca n't yet be sold online under current law . he set up the server for his cyberpharmacy in the backroom of his " real " pharmacy in the city of cologne five years ago and has done a brisk business ever since . " we get about a million hits per month and send out thousands of shipments in that time , " he said .
he hopes he 'll be able to add other medicines to his online selection in the near future .
" think about people with chronic illnesses , who need medicines for diabetes and high blood pressure .
i think it 's possible to send out these kinds of medicines without any risk , " he added . still , weber said , online pharmacies need to have very clear guidelines .
" if they 're legally allowed in germany then there needs to be a quality management system , " he said .
" only real , functioning pharmacies should be allowed to operate online versions and they have to be officially licensed . "
only then could online consultations , either by e-mail or phone , be safeguarded , he said , and would the client be sure he is getting the right medications . patients protecting themselves ? pharmacy associations in germany warn that the introduction of mail-order drugs could be bad medicine for patients .
a " seal of approval " for internet providers has never been successfully established , according to thomas preis , chairman of the north rhine association of pharmacies .
in his opinion , such a scheme would not work for mail-order drug providers either . he categorically rejects any kind of online drug sales , even if a licensed pharmacist is behind the online drug store : " the consumer can not discern whether the drug came through appropriate trade channels .
he ca n't know , where the medicines came from . " he fears that consumers could receive medicines which have passed their expiration date , are of poor quality or only include instructions in a foreign language .
in his opinion , mix-ups are likely . he also rejects the argument that online medicines will end up being less expensive in the long run , saying while online commerce is touted as leading to cost savings , in the end , studies have show the opposite is often true . moreover , weber said , online pharmacies could threaten the existence of their brick and mortar cousins , since they could corner the market on inexpensive drugs .
as a result , real pharmacies would be left with expensive , seldom-used drugs on their shelves in additional to the costs for staffing and consultation .
that , he said , could close them down . positive experience in the netherlands however , dieter hebel , head of gmünder health , sees in a mail-order medicine future the possibility of real savings and perhaps of lowering consumers ' health insurance premiums .
" the pharmacies should not always talk about keeping hold of their monopoly , " he argues .
" rather they should realize that as local service centers , they have a different relationship with customers and can offer them alternatives . " he disagrees that mail-order medicines can pose a danger to the public .
consumers should be able to differentiate which medicines they can buy on the internet and which ones require consultations with a real pharmacist , according to hebel .

starting next year patients in germany will be spared a trip to the pharmacy since they 'll be able to get their prescriptions filled online and mailed to them .
pharmacy groups warn it could endanger patients ' health . proponents of the legalization of mail-order medicine say it has one major advantage - it will lower the costs of health care . patients clicking online to fill prescriptions should pay 10 to 30 percent less for drugs , according to dr. peter weber , who already runs an online pharmacy offering around 10,000 products - mostly vitamins and cough drops , since " real " medicines ca n't yet be sold online under current law . he set up the server for his cyberpharmacy in the backroom of his " real " pharmacy in the city of cologne five years ago and has done a brisk business ever since . " we get about a million hits per month and send out thousands of shipments in that time , " he said .
he hopes he 'll be able to add other medicines to his online selection in the near future .
" think about people with chronic illnesses , who need medicines for diabetes and high blood pressure .
i think it 's possible to send out these kinds of medicines without any risk , " he added . still , weber said , online pharmacies need to have very clear guidelines .
" if they 're legally allowed in germany then there needs to be a quality management system , " he said .
" only real , functioning pharmacies should be allowed to operate online versions and they have to be officially licensed . "
only then could online consultations , either by e-mail or phone , be safeguarded , he said , and would the client be sure he is getting the right medications . patients protecting themselves ? pharmacy associations in germany warn that the introduction of mail-order drugs could be bad medicine for patients .
a " seal of approval " for internet providers has never been successfully established , according to thomas preis , chairman of the north rhine association of pharmacies .
in his opinion , such a scheme would not work for mail-order drug providers either . he categorically rejects any kind of online drug sales , even if a licensed pharmacist is behind the online drug store : " the consumer can not discern whether the drug came through appropriate trade channels .
he ca n't know , where the medicines came from . " he fears that consumers could receive medicines which have passed their expiration date , are of poor quality or only include instructions in a foreign language .
in his opinion , mix-ups are likely . he also rejects the argument that online medicines will end up being less expensive in the long run , saying while online commerce is touted as leading to cost savings , in the end , studies have show the opposite is often true . moreover , weber said , online pharmacies could threaten the existence of their brick and mortar cousins , since they could corner the market on inexpensive drugs .
as a result , real pharmacies would be left with expensive , seldom-used drugs on their shelves in additional to the costs for staffing and consultation .
that , he said , could close them down . positive experience in the netherlands however , dieter hebel , head of gmünder health , sees in a mail-order medicine future the possibility of real savings and perhaps of lowering consumers ' health insurance premiums .
" the pharmacies should not always talk about keeping hold of their monopoly , " he argues .
" rather they should realize that as local service centers , they have a different relationship with customers and can offer them alternatives . " he disagrees that mail-order medicines can pose a danger to the public .
consumers should be able to differentiate which medicines they can buy on the internet and which ones require consultations with a real pharmacist , according to hebel .
he points to experiences in dutch online pharmacies , all of whom have official licensing .

genetically altered corn the latest round in the long fight over genetically manipulated foods ended wednesday in a stalemate , as a three-day world trade organization mini-summit ended in montreal . at the montreal meeting , 25 trade and agriculture ministers from around the world attempted to pave the way for the planned wto summit in cancun , mexico , in september .
the idea behind the mini-summit was to lay the groundwork on some sticky issues in order to make greater strides in september .
among the most intractable of these issues is genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods .
the european union has sought to forbid the sale of such foods in the name of consumer protection ; but the united states says europe maintains a de facto ban on gm foods , without any scientific basis .
free trade and self-regulation should steer the market , the united states says .
opposing viewpoints eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler initially sought transatlantic cooperation at the montreal meeting , noting that just this month the eu had decided to allow the sale of genetically modified foods in europe – provided they came labeled as such , which in the eyes of the eu means a product containing more than 0.9 percent genetically altered proteins or dna .
yet u.s. farmers and food producers have threatened to challenge the eu stance in a panel before the wto in september .
they say the five-year ban on introducing genetically modified products in the european union has already cost u.s. farmers and food producers at least $ 300 million per year .
in the united states , genetically altered products have long been sold without any special consumer label .
an obligatory label that would have to say " genetically altered ingredients , " as the eu ordered earlier in july , is completely unacceptable , because it is expensive and would scare off consumers , the americans argue .
' no social concensus ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler on monday , fischler made a goodwill tour of washington to address the problem , meeting with u.s. trade representative robert zoellick and agriculture secretary ann veneman .
following those meetings , he spoke to an an international assembly of farm lobbyists and diplomats , explaining europe 's position : " if we are not prepared to give consumers a real choice , so that they can decide for themselves if they want to buy chemical products or some other products , if we do n't make sure of that , then there is simply no social consensus in europe for accepting gm products , " fischler said .

a further point under discussion in montreal was product names .
the eu wants world-wide protection for the names of 36 regional products , from bordeaux wine to parma ham .
the u.s. calls this protectionism ; fischler protests .

infringing fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 .
the international war on terrorism and human rights report , released on tuesday , claims that the u.s. has been trampling on human rights since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
referring to legislation forced through congress in the wake of the attacks , the human rights watchdog said , " a series of measures taken to combat terrorism are infringing on fundamental human rights , " particularly civil and political rights .
the bush administration is accused of using immigration laws and an expansive definition of the term " enemy combatants " to by-pass the criminal justice system and deny due process safeguards to persons it interrogated and detained as part of its terrorist investigation .
the u.s. government has increased its powers of surveillance , investigation and detention within its own borders after the attacks , and sources quoted in the report suggest these were implemented to block public scrutiny and limit congressional checks and meaningful judicial review .
the authors of the report warn that these harsh steps could eventually prove to be counter-productive and actually boost support for terrorists .
law free islands the report also focuses on the treatment of prisoners held at the guantanamo bay camp in cuba where hundreds of suspected members of al qaeda and afghanistan 's former taliban regime are being held .
the institute criticized what it called " parallel worlds without rights " and " law-free islands " such as the camp x-ray facility in cuba and cooperatively run detention centers in places like pakistan and the philippines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensory deprivation at camp x-ray .
it expresses concern that prisoners held in such places have neither " access to fair legal proceedings " nor " limits on the time they could be held without judicial review . "
the detainees held in cuba are kept in a state of sensory deprivation , refused the right of counsel and face trial in front of military courts with the prospect of being sentenced to death if found guilty of being an " enemy combatant . "
international attention on guantanamo bay is set to intensify further after concessions by washington to london on british prisoners in guantanamo came to light last week .
the u.s. said that it would not seek the death penalty for two british detainees after sustained pressure from the british government .
wolfgang heinz , co-author of the institute ’ s study , said the decision by the u.s. was " important as it sets a precedent that many other countries -lrb- with prisoners in the u.s. base in cuba -rrb- will now follow up on . "
concessions seen to favor allies heinz said the decision was problematic as washington would almost certainly not extend the concession to other countries , beyond australia and pakistan , already in talks with the u.s. this would create the impression of granting special favors to close allies , he said .
accusing both the u.s. and britain of ignoring human rights issues in the anti-terror campaign , in afghanistan and elsewhere , heinz called for independent monitors - from the un among others - to be dispatched with american , british or german troops involved in these campaigns , to check whether soldiers are involved in abuses and to gather information from service personnel on abuses they observe .

a recent report from the german institute for human rights addresses these concerns and criticizes the bush administration for its questionable methods of bringing terrorists to justice and the overall direction the war on terror is taking the u.s. as it tries to prevent further attacks on its soil .
infringing fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 .
the international war on terrorism and human rights report , released on tuesday , claims that the u.s. has been trampling on human rights since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
referring to legislation forced through congress in the wake of the attacks , the human rights watchdog said , " a series of measures taken to combat terrorism are infringing on fundamental human rights , " particularly civil and political rights .
the bush administration is accused of using immigration laws and an expansive definition of the term " enemy combatants " to by-pass the criminal justice system and deny due process safeguards to persons it interrogated and detained as part of its terrorist investigation .
the u.s. government has increased its powers of surveillance , investigation and detention within its own borders after the attacks , and sources quoted in the report suggest these were implemented to block public scrutiny and limit congressional checks and meaningful judicial review .
the authors of the report warn that these harsh steps could eventually prove to be counter-productive and actually boost support for terrorists .
law free islands the report also focuses on the treatment of prisoners held at the guantanamo bay camp in cuba where hundreds of suspected members of al qaeda and afghanistan 's former taliban regime are being held .
the institute criticized what it called " parallel worlds without rights " and " law-free islands " such as the camp x-ray facility in cuba and cooperatively run detention centers in places like pakistan and the philippines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensory deprivation at camp x-ray .
it expresses concern that prisoners held in such places have neither " access to fair legal proceedings " nor " limits on the time they could be held without judicial review . "
the detainees held in cuba are kept in a state of sensory deprivation , refused the right of counsel and face trial in front of military courts with the prospect of being sentenced to death if found guilty of being an " enemy combatant . "
international attention on guantanamo bay is set to intensify further after concessions by washington to london on british prisoners in guantanamo came to light last week .
the u.s. said that it would not seek the death penalty for two british detainees after sustained pressure from the british government .
wolfgang heinz , co-author of the institute ’ s study , said the decision by the u.s. was " important as it sets a precedent that many other countries -lrb- with prisoners in the u.s. base in cuba -rrb- will now follow up on . "
concessions seen to favor allies heinz said the decision was problematic as washington would almost certainly not extend the concession to other countries , beyond australia and pakistan , already in talks with the u.s. this would create the impression of granting special favors to close allies , he said .
accusing both the u.s. and britain of ignoring human rights issues in the anti-terror campaign , in afghanistan and elsewhere , heinz called for independent monitors - from the un among others - to be dispatched with american , british or german troops involved in these campaigns , to check whether soldiers are involved in abuses and to gather information from service personnel on abuses they observe .
allegations of involvement in killing and torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda suspect ramzi bin al-shaiba was arrested in pakistan .
based on interviews , press reports , and statements by amnesty international and other non-governmental groups , the institute ’ s study also highlights accusations that pre-trial killing or torturing of alleged al qaeda terrorists in countries such as egypt , pakistan and morocco have involved , or have been tolerated by , u.s. intelligence services . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. and eu reach terrorism accord european justice ministers have agreed to sign a deal that will increase already close cooperation with the united states in the fight against terrorism .

files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .
but bisky denies he worked as an official stasi informant . shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was able to get it hands on hundreds of files belonging to the east german secret police known at the stasi .
over the last three years , the so-called “ rosewood ” files were copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany . since the beginning of july , the documents have been available for public research .
bisky , listed as “ unofficial collaborator ” at the foreign section of the east germany ministry for security , is the first high-profile person to be implicated by the rosewood files . the 61 year-old politician admitted on tuesday he had contact to the secret police but denied he worked as a stasi informant .
he told german ard television there was “ nothing new ” in the latest revelations and that he was only of interest to east german authorities because of his travel abroad . “ i wrote the usual travel reports about my trips to the west for my supervisors and passed them on , ” bisky said .
he said he never signed any documents , which would be required to be a stasi informant . the news couldn ’ t have come at a worse time for bisky , who was re-elected in june to lead the beleaguered party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which rose from the ashes of the east german communist party after german reunification .
bisky headed the pds 1993 to 2000 , but was called back to duty as the party has floundered in recent months .
considered part of the party ’ s more pragmatic wing , being listed in the rosewood files could hurt his effort to get the pds back on track . codename “ bienitz ” according to the weekly newspaper die zeit , bisky , who emigrated from west germany to the communist east in 1959 , worked under the codename “ bienitz ” for the stasi from 1966 to 1979 .
he was then “ reactivated ” in 1986 after he became the director of the once-famous film school in babelsberg near berlin . günter nooke , a conservative member of the german parliament , came to bisky ’ s defense on wednesday , saying as a member of a government investigative committee in the 1990s he had known for years about bisky ’ s connections to the stasi .
nooke told the berliner zeitung newspaper the latest details were “ not spectacular enough ” to endanger bisky ’ s political career . although officials tending the rosewood files have warned there will likely be few sensational revelations from the documents , they should fill in some crucial gaps in the extensive investigations of stasi activities .
most files seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the codenames . officials believe that of the some 200,000 names included on the card index , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 are east germans who worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west . after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
but as some documents came to light after 1990 , many stasi informers were outted , leading to bitter recriminations among co-workers , neighbors and even family members .

nooke told the berliner zeitung newspaper the latest details were “ not spectacular enough ” to endanger bisky ’ s political career . although officials tending the rosewood files have warned there will likely be few sensational revelations from the documents , they should fill in some crucial gaps in the extensive investigations of stasi activities .
most files seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the codenames . officials believe that of the some 200,000 names included on the card index , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 are east germans who worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west . after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .

genetically altered corn the latest round in the long fight over genetically manipulated foods ended wednesday in a stalemate , as a three-day world trade organization mini-summit ended in montreal . at the montreal meeting , 25 trade and agriculture ministers from around the world attempted to pave the way for the planned wto summit in cancun , mexico , in september .
the idea behind the mini-summit was to lay the groundwork on some sticky issues in order to make greater strides in september .
among the most intractable of these issues is genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods .
the european union has sought to forbid the sale of such foods in the name of consumer protection ; but the united states says europe maintains a de facto ban on gm foods , without any scientific basis .
free trade and self-regulation should steer the market , the united states says .
opposing viewpoints eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler initially sought transatlantic cooperation at the montreal meeting , noting that just this month the eu had decided to allow the sale of genetically modified foods in europe – provided they came labeled as such , which in the eyes of the eu means a product containing more than 0.9 percent genetically altered proteins or dna .
yet u.s. farmers and food producers have threatened to challenge the eu stance in a panel before the wto in september .
they say the five-year ban on introducing genetically modified products in the european union has already cost u.s. farmers and food producers at least $ 300 million per year .
in the united states , genetically altered products have long been sold without any special consumer label .
an obligatory label that would have to say " genetically altered ingredients , " as the eu ordered earlier in july , is completely unacceptable , because it is expensive and would scare off consumers , the americans argue .
' no social concensus ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler on monday , fischler made a goodwill tour of washington to address the problem , meeting with u.s. trade representative robert zoellick and agriculture secretary ann veneman .
following those meetings , he spoke to an an international assembly of farm lobbyists and diplomats , explaining europe 's position : " if we are not prepared to give consumers a real choice , so that they can decide for themselves if they want to buy chemical products or some other products , if we do n't make sure of that , then there is simply no social consensus in europe for accepting gm products , " fischler said .
what 's in a name ?
a further point under discussion in montreal was product names .
the eu wants world-wide protection for the names of 36 regional products , from bordeaux wine to parma ham .
the u.s. calls this protectionism ; fischler protests .
" we simply do n't agree that , for example , the maker of parma ham ca n't export the product to canada and have it sold under the name of parma ham , simply because some clever businessman in canada thought of securing the rights to that name , " fischler said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm food debate rears its head again genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban .

a recent report from the german institute for human rights addresses these concerns and criticizes the bush administration for its questionable methods of bringing terrorists to justice and the overall direction the war on terror is taking the u.s. as it tries to prevent further attacks on its soil .
infringing fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 .
the international war on terrorism and human rights report , released on tuesday , claims that the u.s. has been trampling on human rights since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
referring to legislation forced through congress in the wake of the attacks , the human rights watchdog said , " a series of measures taken to combat terrorism are infringing on fundamental human rights , " particularly civil and political rights .
the bush administration is accused of using immigration laws and an expansive definition of the term " enemy combatants " to by-pass the criminal justice system and deny due process safeguards to persons it interrogated and detained as part of its terrorist investigation .
the u.s. government has increased its powers of surveillance , investigation and detention within its own borders after the attacks , and sources quoted in the report suggest these were implemented to block public scrutiny and limit congressional checks and meaningful judicial review .
the authors of the report warn that these harsh steps could eventually prove to be counter-productive and actually boost support for terrorists .
law free islands the report also focuses on the treatment of prisoners held at the guantanamo bay camp in cuba where hundreds of suspected members of al qaeda and afghanistan 's former taliban regime are being held .
the institute criticized what it called " parallel worlds without rights " and " law-free islands " such as the camp x-ray facility in cuba and cooperatively run detention centers in places like pakistan and the philippines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensory deprivation at camp x-ray .
it expresses concern that prisoners held in such places have neither " access to fair legal proceedings " nor " limits on the time they could be held without judicial review . "
the detainees held in cuba are kept in a state of sensory deprivation , refused the right of counsel and face trial in front of military courts with the prospect of being sentenced to death if found guilty of being an " enemy combatant . "
international attention on guantanamo bay is set to intensify further after concessions by washington to london on british prisoners in guantanamo came to light last week .
the u.s. said that it would not seek the death penalty for two british detainees after sustained pressure from the british government .
wolfgang heinz , co-author of the institute ’ s study , said the decision by the u.s. was " important as it sets a precedent that many other countries -lrb- with prisoners in the u.s. base in cuba -rrb- will now follow up on . "
concessions seen to favor allies heinz said the decision was problematic as washington would almost certainly not extend the concession to other countries , beyond australia and pakistan , already in talks with the u.s. this would create the impression of granting special favors to close allies , he said .
accusing both the u.s. and britain of ignoring human rights issues in the anti-terror campaign , in afghanistan and elsewhere , heinz called for independent monitors - from the un among others - to be dispatched with american , british or german troops involved in these campaigns , to check whether soldiers are involved in abuses and to gather information from service personnel on abuses they observe .
allegations of involvement in killing and torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda suspect ramzi bin al-shaiba was arrested in pakistan .
based on interviews , press reports , and statements by amnesty international and other non-governmental groups , the institute ’ s study also highlights accusations that pre-trial killing or torturing of alleged al qaeda terrorists in countries such as egypt , pakistan and morocco have involved , or have been tolerated by , u.s. intelligence services . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. and eu reach terrorism accord european justice ministers have agreed to sign a deal that will increase already close cooperation with the united states in the fight against terrorism .

considered part of the party ’ s more pragmatic wing , being listed in the rosewood files could hurt his effort to get the pds back on track . codename “ bienitz ” according to the weekly newspaper die zeit , bisky , who emigrated from west germany to the communist east in 1959 , worked under the codename “ bienitz ” for the stasi from 1966 to 1979 .
he was then “ reactivated ” in 1986 after he became the director of the once-famous film school in babelsberg near berlin . günter nooke , a conservative member of the german parliament , came to bisky ’ s defense on wednesday , saying as a member of a government investigative committee in the 1990s he had known for years about bisky ’ s connections to the stasi .
nooke told the berliner zeitung newspaper the latest details were “ not spectacular enough ” to endanger bisky ’ s political career . although officials tending the rosewood files have warned there will likely be few sensational revelations from the documents , they should fill in some crucial gaps in the extensive investigations of stasi activities .
most files seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the codenames . officials believe that of the some 200,000 names included on the card index , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 are east germans who worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west . after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
but as some documents came to light after 1990 , many stasi informers were outted , leading to bitter recriminations among co-workers , neighbors and even family members .
millions of people are estimated to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .
the secret police often used draconian methods to persuade or intimidating ordinary people to spy on their neighbors and friends . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies the cia recently handed over sensitive files that name thousands of former east german secret service agents to germany .

genetically altered corn the latest round in the long fight over genetically manipulated foods ended wednesday in a stalemate , as a three-day world trade organization mini-summit ended in montreal . at the montreal meeting , 25 trade and agriculture ministers from around the world attempted to pave the way for the planned wto summit in cancun , mexico , in september .
the idea behind the mini-summit was to lay the groundwork on some sticky issues in order to make greater strides in september .
among the most intractable of these issues is genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods .

yet u.s. farmers and food producers have threatened to challenge the eu stance in a panel before the wto in september .
they say the five-year ban on introducing genetically modified products in the european union has already cost u.s. farmers and food producers at least $ 300 million per year .
in the united states , genetically altered products have long been sold without any special consumer label .
an obligatory label that would have to say " genetically altered ingredients , " as the eu ordered earlier in july , is completely unacceptable , because it is expensive and would scare off consumers , the americans argue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.07.2003 german human rights report criticizes united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment of suspected terrorists in u.s. custody is once more called into question international pressure on the united states ’ approach to the war on terror is set to increase after a human rights watchdog in germany issued a damning report of u.s. infringements . as president george w. bush ’ s mission to dismantle terror organizations around the world continues to pull the united states into military operations such as afghanistan and iraq , global concern increases about the legal and ethical dilemmas the war on terror leaves in its wake .
a recent report from the german institute for human rights addresses these concerns and criticizes the bush administration for its questionable methods of bringing terrorists to justice and the overall direction the war on terror is taking the u.s. as it tries to prevent further attacks on its soil .
infringing fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 .
the international war on terrorism and human rights report , released on tuesday , claims that the u.s. has been trampling on human rights since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
referring to legislation forced through congress in the wake of the attacks , the human rights watchdog said , " a series of measures taken to combat terrorism are infringing on fundamental human rights , " particularly civil and political rights .
the bush administration is accused of using immigration laws and an expansive definition of the term " enemy combatants " to by-pass the criminal justice system and deny due process safeguards to persons it interrogated and detained as part of its terrorist investigation .
the u.s. government has increased its powers of surveillance , investigation and detention within its own borders after the attacks , and sources quoted in the report suggest these were implemented to block public scrutiny and limit congressional checks and meaningful judicial review .
the authors of the report warn that these harsh steps could eventually prove to be counter-productive and actually boost support for terrorists .
law free islands the report also focuses on the treatment of prisoners held at the guantanamo bay camp in cuba where hundreds of suspected members of al qaeda and afghanistan 's former taliban regime are being held .
the institute criticized what it called " parallel worlds without rights " and " law-free islands " such as the camp x-ray facility in cuba and cooperatively run detention centers in places like pakistan and the philippines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensory deprivation at camp x-ray .
it expresses concern that prisoners held in such places have neither " access to fair legal proceedings " nor " limits on the time they could be held without judicial review . "
the detainees held in cuba are kept in a state of sensory deprivation , refused the right of counsel and face trial in front of military courts with the prospect of being sentenced to death if found guilty of being an " enemy combatant . "
international attention on guantanamo bay is set to intensify further after concessions by washington to london on british prisoners in guantanamo came to light last week .
the u.s. said that it would not seek the death penalty for two british detainees after sustained pressure from the british government .
wolfgang heinz , co-author of the institute ’ s study , said the decision by the u.s. was " important as it sets a precedent that many other countries -lrb- with prisoners in the u.s. base in cuba -rrb- will now follow up on . "
concessions seen to favor allies heinz said the decision was problematic as washington would almost certainly not extend the concession to other countries , beyond australia and pakistan , already in talks with the u.s. this would create the impression of granting special favors to close allies , he said .
accusing both the u.s. and britain of ignoring human rights issues in the anti-terror campaign , in afghanistan and elsewhere , heinz called for independent monitors - from the un among others - to be dispatched with american , british or german troops involved in these campaigns , to check whether soldiers are involved in abuses and to gather information from service personnel on abuses they observe .
allegations of involvement in killing and torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda suspect ramzi bin al-shaiba was arrested in pakistan .
based on interviews , press reports , and statements by amnesty international and other non-governmental groups , the institute ’ s study also highlights accusations that pre-trial killing or torturing of alleged al qaeda terrorists in countries such as egypt , pakistan and morocco have involved , or have been tolerated by , u.s. intelligence services . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. and eu reach terrorism accord european justice ministers have agreed to sign a deal that will increase already close cooperation with the united states in the fight against terrorism .

a recent report from the german institute for human rights addresses these concerns and criticizes the bush administration for its questionable methods of bringing terrorists to justice and the overall direction the war on terror is taking the u.s. as it tries to prevent further attacks on its soil .
infringing fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 .
the international war on terrorism and human rights report , released on tuesday , claims that the u.s. has been trampling on human rights since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
referring to legislation forced through congress in the wake of the attacks , the human rights watchdog said , " a series of measures taken to combat terrorism are infringing on fundamental human rights , " particularly civil and political rights .
the bush administration is accused of using immigration laws and an expansive definition of the term " enemy combatants " to by-pass the criminal justice system and deny due process safeguards to persons it interrogated and detained as part of its terrorist investigation .
the u.s. government has increased its powers of surveillance , investigation and detention within its own borders after the attacks , and sources quoted in the report suggest these were implemented to block public scrutiny and limit congressional checks and meaningful judicial review .
the authors of the report warn that these harsh steps could eventually prove to be counter-productive and actually boost support for terrorists .
law free islands the report also focuses on the treatment of prisoners held at the guantanamo bay camp in cuba where hundreds of suspected members of al qaeda and afghanistan 's former taliban regime are being held .
the institute criticized what it called " parallel worlds without rights " and " law-free islands " such as the camp x-ray facility in cuba and cooperatively run detention centers in places like pakistan and the philippines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensory deprivation at camp x-ray .
it expresses concern that prisoners held in such places have neither " access to fair legal proceedings " nor " limits on the time they could be held without judicial review . "
the detainees held in cuba are kept in a state of sensory deprivation , refused the right of counsel and face trial in front of military courts with the prospect of being sentenced to death if found guilty of being an " enemy combatant . "
international attention on guantanamo bay is set to intensify further after concessions by washington to london on british prisoners in guantanamo came to light last week .
the u.s. said that it would not seek the death penalty for two british detainees after sustained pressure from the british government .
wolfgang heinz , co-author of the institute ’ s study , said the decision by the u.s. was " important as it sets a precedent that many other countries -lrb- with prisoners in the u.s. base in cuba -rrb- will now follow up on . "
concessions seen to favor allies heinz said the decision was problematic as washington would almost certainly not extend the concession to other countries , beyond australia and pakistan , already in talks with the u.s. this would create the impression of granting special favors to close allies , he said .
accusing both the u.s. and britain of ignoring human rights issues in the anti-terror campaign , in afghanistan and elsewhere , heinz called for independent monitors - from the un among others - to be dispatched with american , british or german troops involved in these campaigns , to check whether soldiers are involved in abuses and to gather information from service personnel on abuses they observe .

genetically altered corn the latest round in the long fight over genetically manipulated foods ended wednesday in a stalemate , as a three-day world trade organization mini-summit ended in montreal . at the montreal meeting , 25 trade and agriculture ministers from around the world attempted to pave the way for the planned wto summit in cancun , mexico , in september .
the idea behind the mini-summit was to lay the groundwork on some sticky issues in order to make greater strides in september .
among the most intractable of these issues is genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods .
the european union has sought to forbid the sale of such foods in the name of consumer protection ; but the united states says europe maintains a de facto ban on gm foods , without any scientific basis .
free trade and self-regulation should steer the market , the united states says .
opposing viewpoints eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler initially sought transatlantic cooperation at the montreal meeting , noting that just this month the eu had decided to allow the sale of genetically modified foods in europe – provided they came labeled as such , which in the eyes of the eu means a product containing more than 0.9 percent genetically altered proteins or dna .
yet u.s. farmers and food producers have threatened to challenge the eu stance in a panel before the wto in september .
they say the five-year ban on introducing genetically modified products in the european union has already cost u.s. farmers and food producers at least $ 300 million per year .
in the united states , genetically altered products have long been sold without any special consumer label .
an obligatory label that would have to say " genetically altered ingredients , " as the eu ordered earlier in july , is completely unacceptable , because it is expensive and would scare off consumers , the americans argue .
' no social concensus ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler on monday , fischler made a goodwill tour of washington to address the problem , meeting with u.s. trade representative robert zoellick and agriculture secretary ann veneman .
following those meetings , he spoke to an an international assembly of farm lobbyists and diplomats , explaining europe 's position : " if we are not prepared to give consumers a real choice , so that they can decide for themselves if they want to buy chemical products or some other products , if we do n't make sure of that , then there is simply no social consensus in europe for accepting gm products , " fischler said .
what 's in a name ?
a further point under discussion in montreal was product names .

starting next year patients in germany will be spared a trip to the pharmacy since they 'll be able to get their prescriptions filled online and mailed to them .
pharmacy groups warn it could endanger patients ' health . proponents of the legalization of mail-order medicine say it has one major advantage - it will lower the costs of health care . patients clicking online to fill prescriptions should pay 10 to 30 percent less for drugs , according to dr. peter weber , who already runs an online pharmacy offering around 10,000 products - mostly vitamins and cough drops , since " real " medicines ca n't yet be sold online under current law . he set up the server for his cyberpharmacy in the backroom of his " real " pharmacy in the city of cologne five years ago and has done a brisk business ever since . " we get about a million hits per month and send out thousands of shipments in that time , " he said .
he hopes he 'll be able to add other medicines to his online selection in the near future .
" think about people with chronic illnesses , who need medicines for diabetes and high blood pressure .
i think it 's possible to send out these kinds of medicines without any risk , " he added . still , weber said , online pharmacies need to have very clear guidelines .
" if they 're legally allowed in germany then there needs to be a quality management system , " he said .
" only real , functioning pharmacies should be allowed to operate online versions and they have to be officially licensed . "
only then could online consultations , either by e-mail or phone , be safeguarded , he said , and would the client be sure he is getting the right medications . patients protecting themselves ? pharmacy associations in germany warn that the introduction of mail-order drugs could be bad medicine for patients .
a " seal of approval " for internet providers has never been successfully established , according to thomas preis , chairman of the north rhine association of pharmacies .
in his opinion , such a scheme would not work for mail-order drug providers either . he categorically rejects any kind of online drug sales , even if a licensed pharmacist is behind the online drug store : " the consumer can not discern whether the drug came through appropriate trade channels .
he ca n't know , where the medicines came from . " he fears that consumers could receive medicines which have passed their expiration date , are of poor quality or only include instructions in a foreign language .
in his opinion , mix-ups are likely . he also rejects the argument that online medicines will end up being less expensive in the long run , saying while online commerce is touted as leading to cost savings , in the end , studies have show the opposite is often true . moreover , weber said , online pharmacies could threaten the existence of their brick and mortar cousins , since they could corner the market on inexpensive drugs .
as a result , real pharmacies would be left with expensive , seldom-used drugs on their shelves in additional to the costs for staffing and consultation .
that , he said , could close them down . positive experience in the netherlands however , dieter hebel , head of gmünder health , sees in a mail-order medicine future the possibility of real savings and perhaps of lowering consumers ' health insurance premiums .
" the pharmacies should not always talk about keeping hold of their monopoly , " he argues .
" rather they should realize that as local service centers , they have a different relationship with customers and can offer them alternatives . " he disagrees that mail-order medicines can pose a danger to the public .
consumers should be able to differentiate which medicines they can buy on the internet and which ones require consultations with a real pharmacist , according to hebel .
he points to experiences in dutch online pharmacies , all of whom have official licensing .

" if they 're legally allowed in germany then there needs to be a quality management system , " he said .
" only real , functioning pharmacies should be allowed to operate online versions and they have to be officially licensed . "
only then could online consultations , either by e-mail or phone , be safeguarded , he said , and would the client be sure he is getting the right medications . patients protecting themselves ? pharmacy associations in germany warn that the introduction of mail-order drugs could be bad medicine for patients .
a " seal of approval " for internet providers has never been successfully established , according to thomas preis , chairman of the north rhine association of pharmacies .
in his opinion , such a scheme would not work for mail-order drug providers either . he categorically rejects any kind of online drug sales , even if a licensed pharmacist is behind the online drug store : " the consumer can not discern whether the drug came through appropriate trade channels .
he ca n't know , where the medicines came from . " he fears that consumers could receive medicines which have passed their expiration date , are of poor quality or only include instructions in a foreign language .
in his opinion , mix-ups are likely . he also rejects the argument that online medicines will end up being less expensive in the long run , saying while online commerce is touted as leading to cost savings , in the end , studies have show the opposite is often true . moreover , weber said , online pharmacies could threaten the existence of their brick and mortar cousins , since they could corner the market on inexpensive drugs .
as a result , real pharmacies would be left with expensive , seldom-used drugs on their shelves in additional to the costs for staffing and consultation .
that , he said , could close them down . positive experience in the netherlands however , dieter hebel , head of gmünder health , sees in a mail-order medicine future the possibility of real savings and perhaps of lowering consumers ' health insurance premiums .
" the pharmacies should not always talk about keeping hold of their monopoly , " he argues .
" rather they should realize that as local service centers , they have a different relationship with customers and can offer them alternatives . " he disagrees that mail-order medicines can pose a danger to the public .
consumers should be able to differentiate which medicines they can buy on the internet and which ones require consultations with a real pharmacist , according to hebel .
he points to experiences in dutch online pharmacies , all of whom have official licensing .

files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .
but bisky denies he worked as an official stasi informant . shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was able to get it hands on hundreds of files belonging to the east german secret police known at the stasi .
over the last three years , the so-called “ rosewood ” files were copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany . since the beginning of july , the documents have been available for public research .
bisky , listed as “ unofficial collaborator ” at the foreign section of the east germany ministry for security , is the first high-profile person to be implicated by the rosewood files . the 61 year-old politician admitted on tuesday he had contact to the secret police but denied he worked as a stasi informant .
he told german ard television there was “ nothing new ” in the latest revelations and that he was only of interest to east german authorities because of his travel abroad . “ i wrote the usual travel reports about my trips to the west for my supervisors and passed them on , ” bisky said .
he said he never signed any documents , which would be required to be a stasi informant . the news couldn ’ t have come at a worse time for bisky , who was re-elected in june to lead the beleaguered party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which rose from the ashes of the east german communist party after german reunification .
bisky headed the pds 1993 to 2000 , but was called back to duty as the party has floundered in recent months .
considered part of the party ’ s more pragmatic wing , being listed in the rosewood files could hurt his effort to get the pds back on track . codename “ bienitz ” according to the weekly newspaper die zeit , bisky , who emigrated from west germany to the communist east in 1959 , worked under the codename “ bienitz ” for the stasi from 1966 to 1979 .
he was then “ reactivated ” in 1986 after he became the director of the once-famous film school in babelsberg near berlin . günter nooke , a conservative member of the german parliament , came to bisky ’ s defense on wednesday , saying as a member of a government investigative committee in the 1990s he had known for years about bisky ’ s connections to the stasi .
nooke told the berliner zeitung newspaper the latest details were “ not spectacular enough ” to endanger bisky ’ s political career . although officials tending the rosewood files have warned there will likely be few sensational revelations from the documents , they should fill in some crucial gaps in the extensive investigations of stasi activities .
most files seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the codenames . officials believe that of the some 200,000 names included on the card index , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 are east germans who worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west . after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
but as some documents came to light after 1990 , many stasi informers were outted , leading to bitter recriminations among co-workers , neighbors and even family members .
millions of people are estimated to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .
the secret police often used draconian methods to persuade or intimidating ordinary people to spy on their neighbors and friends . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies the cia recently handed over sensitive files that name thousands of former east german secret service agents to germany .
the " rosewood " files are expected to shed light on thousands of hitherto unexposed stasi spies .

but bisky denies he worked as an official stasi informant . shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was able to get it hands on hundreds of files belonging to the east german secret police known at the stasi .
over the last three years , the so-called “ rosewood ” files were copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany . since the beginning of july , the documents have been available for public research .
bisky , listed as “ unofficial collaborator ” at the foreign section of the east germany ministry for security , is the first high-profile person to be implicated by the rosewood files . the 61 year-old politician admitted on tuesday he had contact to the secret police but denied he worked as a stasi informant .
he told german ard television there was “ nothing new ” in the latest revelations and that he was only of interest to east german authorities because of his travel abroad . “ i wrote the usual travel reports about my trips to the west for my supervisors and passed them on , ” bisky said .
he said he never signed any documents , which would be required to be a stasi informant . the news couldn ’ t have come at a worse time for bisky , who was re-elected in june to lead the beleaguered party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which rose from the ashes of the east german communist party after german reunification .
bisky headed the pds 1993 to 2000 , but was called back to duty as the party has floundered in recent months .
considered part of the party ’ s more pragmatic wing , being listed in the rosewood files could hurt his effort to get the pds back on track . codename “ bienitz ” according to the weekly newspaper die zeit , bisky , who emigrated from west germany to the communist east in 1959 , worked under the codename “ bienitz ” for the stasi from 1966 to 1979 .
he was then “ reactivated ” in 1986 after he became the director of the once-famous film school in babelsberg near berlin . günter nooke , a conservative member of the german parliament , came to bisky ’ s defense on wednesday , saying as a member of a government investigative committee in the 1990s he had known for years about bisky ’ s connections to the stasi .
nooke told the berliner zeitung newspaper the latest details were “ not spectacular enough ” to endanger bisky ’ s political career . although officials tending the rosewood files have warned there will likely be few sensational revelations from the documents , they should fill in some crucial gaps in the extensive investigations of stasi activities .
most files seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the codenames . officials believe that of the some 200,000 names included on the card index , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 are east germans who worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west . after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
but as some documents came to light after 1990 , many stasi informers were outted , leading to bitter recriminations among co-workers , neighbors and even family members .

infringing fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 .
the international war on terrorism and human rights report , released on tuesday , claims that the u.s. has been trampling on human rights since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
referring to legislation forced through congress in the wake of the attacks , the human rights watchdog said , " a series of measures taken to combat terrorism are infringing on fundamental human rights , " particularly civil and political rights .
the bush administration is accused of using immigration laws and an expansive definition of the term " enemy combatants " to by-pass the criminal justice system and deny due process safeguards to persons it interrogated and detained as part of its terrorist investigation .
the u.s. government has increased its powers of surveillance , investigation and detention within its own borders after the attacks , and sources quoted in the report suggest these were implemented to block public scrutiny and limit congressional checks and meaningful judicial review .
the authors of the report warn that these harsh steps could eventually prove to be counter-productive and actually boost support for terrorists .
law free islands the report also focuses on the treatment of prisoners held at the guantanamo bay camp in cuba where hundreds of suspected members of al qaeda and afghanistan 's former taliban regime are being held .
the institute criticized what it called " parallel worlds without rights " and " law-free islands " such as the camp x-ray facility in cuba and cooperatively run detention centers in places like pakistan and the philippines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensory deprivation at camp x-ray .
it expresses concern that prisoners held in such places have neither " access to fair legal proceedings " nor " limits on the time they could be held without judicial review . "
the detainees held in cuba are kept in a state of sensory deprivation , refused the right of counsel and face trial in front of military courts with the prospect of being sentenced to death if found guilty of being an " enemy combatant . "
international attention on guantanamo bay is set to intensify further after concessions by washington to london on british prisoners in guantanamo came to light last week .
the u.s. said that it would not seek the death penalty for two british detainees after sustained pressure from the british government .
wolfgang heinz , co-author of the institute ’ s study , said the decision by the u.s. was " important as it sets a precedent that many other countries -lrb- with prisoners in the u.s. base in cuba -rrb- will now follow up on . "
concessions seen to favor allies heinz said the decision was problematic as washington would almost certainly not extend the concession to other countries , beyond australia and pakistan , already in talks with the u.s. this would create the impression of granting special favors to close allies , he said .
accusing both the u.s. and britain of ignoring human rights issues in the anti-terror campaign , in afghanistan and elsewhere , heinz called for independent monitors - from the un among others - to be dispatched with american , british or german troops involved in these campaigns , to check whether soldiers are involved in abuses and to gather information from service personnel on abuses they observe .

genetically altered corn the latest round in the long fight over genetically manipulated foods ended wednesday in a stalemate , as a three-day world trade organization mini-summit ended in montreal . at the montreal meeting , 25 trade and agriculture ministers from around the world attempted to pave the way for the planned wto summit in cancun , mexico , in september .
the idea behind the mini-summit was to lay the groundwork on some sticky issues in order to make greater strides in september .
among the most intractable of these issues is genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods .
the european union has sought to forbid the sale of such foods in the name of consumer protection ; but the united states says europe maintains a de facto ban on gm foods , without any scientific basis .
free trade and self-regulation should steer the market , the united states says .
opposing viewpoints eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler initially sought transatlantic cooperation at the montreal meeting , noting that just this month the eu had decided to allow the sale of genetically modified foods in europe – provided they came labeled as such , which in the eyes of the eu means a product containing more than 0.9 percent genetically altered proteins or dna .
yet u.s. farmers and food producers have threatened to challenge the eu stance in a panel before the wto in september .
they say the five-year ban on introducing genetically modified products in the european union has already cost u.s. farmers and food producers at least $ 300 million per year .
in the united states , genetically altered products have long been sold without any special consumer label .
an obligatory label that would have to say " genetically altered ingredients , " as the eu ordered earlier in july , is completely unacceptable , because it is expensive and would scare off consumers , the americans argue .
' no social concensus ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler on monday , fischler made a goodwill tour of washington to address the problem , meeting with u.s. trade representative robert zoellick and agriculture secretary ann veneman .
following those meetings , he spoke to an an international assembly of farm lobbyists and diplomats , explaining europe 's position : " if we are not prepared to give consumers a real choice , so that they can decide for themselves if they want to buy chemical products or some other products , if we do n't make sure of that , then there is simply no social consensus in europe for accepting gm products , " fischler said .
what 's in a name ?
a further point under discussion in montreal was product names .
the eu wants world-wide protection for the names of 36 regional products , from bordeaux wine to parma ham .
the u.s. calls this protectionism ; fischler protests .
" we simply do n't agree that , for example , the maker of parma ham ca n't export the product to canada and have it sold under the name of parma ham , simply because some clever businessman in canada thought of securing the rights to that name , " fischler said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm food debate rears its head again genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban .

starting next year patients in germany will be spared a trip to the pharmacy since they 'll be able to get their prescriptions filled online and mailed to them .
pharmacy groups warn it could endanger patients ' health . proponents of the legalization of mail-order medicine say it has one major advantage - it will lower the costs of health care . patients clicking online to fill prescriptions should pay 10 to 30 percent less for drugs , according to dr. peter weber , who already runs an online pharmacy offering around 10,000 products - mostly vitamins and cough drops , since " real " medicines ca n't yet be sold online under current law . he set up the server for his cyberpharmacy in the backroom of his " real " pharmacy in the city of cologne five years ago and has done a brisk business ever since .

" think about people with chronic illnesses , who need medicines for diabetes and high blood pressure .
i think it 's possible to send out these kinds of medicines without any risk , " he added . still , weber said , online pharmacies need to have very clear guidelines .
" if they 're legally allowed in germany then there needs to be a quality management system , " he said .
" only real , functioning pharmacies should be allowed to operate online versions and they have to be officially licensed . "

he ca n't know , where the medicines came from . " he fears that consumers could receive medicines which have passed their expiration date , are of poor quality or only include instructions in a foreign language .
in his opinion , mix-ups are likely . he also rejects the argument that online medicines will end up being less expensive in the long run , saying while online commerce is touted as leading to cost savings , in the end , studies have show the opposite is often true . moreover , weber said , online pharmacies could threaten the existence of their brick and mortar cousins , since they could corner the market on inexpensive drugs .
as a result , real pharmacies would be left with expensive , seldom-used drugs on their shelves in additional to the costs for staffing and consultation .
that , he said , could close them down . positive experience in the netherlands however , dieter hebel , head of gmünder health , sees in a mail-order medicine future the possibility of real savings and perhaps of lowering consumers ' health insurance premiums .
" the pharmacies should not always talk about keeping hold of their monopoly , " he argues .
" rather they should realize that as local service centers , they have a different relationship with customers and can offer them alternatives . " he disagrees that mail-order medicines can pose a danger to the public .
consumers should be able to differentiate which medicines they can buy on the internet and which ones require consultations with a real pharmacist , according to hebel .

you might not be winning the yellow jersey just yet , but cycling can still be a rewarding experience .
a tour by the rhine offers many delights - all taking a fraction of the energy needed to win the tour de france . if the tour de france is still a little out of your league , then why not try the tour de rhine ?
we ’ re not talking about competitive cycling here , but a leisurely ride down germany ’ s most famous river , taking in the historic roman city of cologne , the former cold war capital of bonn and finishing with a well-earned break in koblenz , at the cross roads of the rhine and mosel . and if pleasant cycling is the order of the day but you still secretly fancy yourself as the next jan ullrich or lance armstrong , then you can always take in the sights dressed head to toe in luminous lycra – many do . after all cycling is seriously good fun in germany , with the emphasis on " seriously . "
germany is a country where leisure is not just a business or pastime , but a fundamental right of the people . one set of leisure seekers that benefits most from this fact are the cyclists .
those enjoying the winding paths of the rhineland area are blessed with a total of 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- of paved , maintained and meticulously-routed cycle highways which snake around and bisect the countryside .
save for a few close calls with nearby autobahns , this route , like most of them in germany , takes in hill and dale , river and stream and , of course , the odd beer garden .
in the footseps of caesar and attila the hun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling means family fun in germany .
as with most things in germany , cycling has its own order .
many routes offer an infrastructure of signs which highlight places of interest for those who don ’ t want to miss anything out .
the route along the rhine is no exception with its romantic vistas and historical legacies .
the paths follow in the sandaled footsteps of julius caesar and his legions who settled along the river at cologne , bonn , nierstein and koblenz , while attila the hun 's butchery hereabouts earned him the nom de guerre " the scourge of god . "
the timbered houses in the cobblestone villages along these banks also witnessed the great plague and the thirty years war .

you might not be winning the yellow jersey just yet , but cycling can still be a rewarding experience .
a tour by the rhine offers many delights - all taking a fraction of the energy needed to win the tour de france . if the tour de france is still a little out of your league , then why not try the tour de rhine ?
we ’ re not talking about competitive cycling here , but a leisurely ride down germany ’ s most famous river , taking in the historic roman city of cologne , the former cold war capital of bonn and finishing with a well-earned break in koblenz , at the cross roads of the rhine and mosel . and if pleasant cycling is the order of the day but you still secretly fancy yourself as the next jan ullrich or lance armstrong , then you can always take in the sights dressed head to toe in luminous lycra – many do . after all cycling is seriously good fun in germany , with the emphasis on " seriously . "
germany is a country where leisure is not just a business or pastime , but a fundamental right of the people . one set of leisure seekers that benefits most from this fact are the cyclists .
those enjoying the winding paths of the rhineland area are blessed with a total of 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- of paved , maintained and meticulously-routed cycle highways which snake around and bisect the countryside .
save for a few close calls with nearby autobahns , this route , like most of them in germany , takes in hill and dale , river and stream and , of course , the odd beer garden .

as with most things in germany , cycling has its own order .
many routes offer an infrastructure of signs which highlight places of interest for those who don ’ t want to miss anything out .
the route along the rhine is no exception with its romantic vistas and historical legacies .
the paths follow in the sandaled footsteps of julius caesar and his legions who settled along the river at cologne , bonn , nierstein and koblenz , while attila the hun 's butchery hereabouts earned him the nom de guerre " the scourge of god . "
the timbered houses in the cobblestone villages along these banks also witnessed the great plague and the thirty years war .
from time to time , these banks also experience flooding - something to bear in mind before setting out .

a recent report from the german institute for human rights addresses these concerns and criticizes the bush administration for its questionable methods of bringing terrorists to justice and the overall direction the war on terror is taking the u.s. as it tries to prevent further attacks on its soil .
infringing fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 .
the international war on terrorism and human rights report , released on tuesday , claims that the u.s. has been trampling on human rights since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
referring to legislation forced through congress in the wake of the attacks , the human rights watchdog said , " a series of measures taken to combat terrorism are infringing on fundamental human rights , " particularly civil and political rights .
the bush administration is accused of using immigration laws and an expansive definition of the term " enemy combatants " to by-pass the criminal justice system and deny due process safeguards to persons it interrogated and detained as part of its terrorist investigation .
the u.s. government has increased its powers of surveillance , investigation and detention within its own borders after the attacks , and sources quoted in the report suggest these were implemented to block public scrutiny and limit congressional checks and meaningful judicial review .
the authors of the report warn that these harsh steps could eventually prove to be counter-productive and actually boost support for terrorists .
law free islands the report also focuses on the treatment of prisoners held at the guantanamo bay camp in cuba where hundreds of suspected members of al qaeda and afghanistan 's former taliban regime are being held .
the institute criticized what it called " parallel worlds without rights " and " law-free islands " such as the camp x-ray facility in cuba and cooperatively run detention centers in places like pakistan and the philippines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensory deprivation at camp x-ray .
it expresses concern that prisoners held in such places have neither " access to fair legal proceedings " nor " limits on the time they could be held without judicial review . "
the detainees held in cuba are kept in a state of sensory deprivation , refused the right of counsel and face trial in front of military courts with the prospect of being sentenced to death if found guilty of being an " enemy combatant . "
international attention on guantanamo bay is set to intensify further after concessions by washington to london on british prisoners in guantanamo came to light last week .
the u.s. said that it would not seek the death penalty for two british detainees after sustained pressure from the british government .
wolfgang heinz , co-author of the institute ’ s study , said the decision by the u.s. was " important as it sets a precedent that many other countries -lrb- with prisoners in the u.s. base in cuba -rrb- will now follow up on . "
concessions seen to favor allies heinz said the decision was problematic as washington would almost certainly not extend the concession to other countries , beyond australia and pakistan , already in talks with the u.s. this would create the impression of granting special favors to close allies , he said .
accusing both the u.s. and britain of ignoring human rights issues in the anti-terror campaign , in afghanistan and elsewhere , heinz called for independent monitors - from the un among others - to be dispatched with american , british or german troops involved in these campaigns , to check whether soldiers are involved in abuses and to gather information from service personnel on abuses they observe .
allegations of involvement in killing and torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda suspect ramzi bin al-shaiba was arrested in pakistan .
based on interviews , press reports , and statements by amnesty international and other non-governmental groups , the institute ’ s study also highlights accusations that pre-trial killing or torturing of alleged al qaeda terrorists in countries such as egypt , pakistan and morocco have involved , or have been tolerated by , u.s. intelligence services . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. and eu reach terrorism accord european justice ministers have agreed to sign a deal that will increase already close cooperation with the united states in the fight against terrorism .

genetically altered corn the latest round in the long fight over genetically manipulated foods ended wednesday in a stalemate , as a three-day world trade organization mini-summit ended in montreal . at the montreal meeting , 25 trade and agriculture ministers from around the world attempted to pave the way for the planned wto summit in cancun , mexico , in september .
the idea behind the mini-summit was to lay the groundwork on some sticky issues in order to make greater strides in september .
among the most intractable of these issues is genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods .
the european union has sought to forbid the sale of such foods in the name of consumer protection ; but the united states says europe maintains a de facto ban on gm foods , without any scientific basis .
free trade and self-regulation should steer the market , the united states says .
opposing viewpoints eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler initially sought transatlantic cooperation at the montreal meeting , noting that just this month the eu had decided to allow the sale of genetically modified foods in europe – provided they came labeled as such , which in the eyes of the eu means a product containing more than 0.9 percent genetically altered proteins or dna .
yet u.s. farmers and food producers have threatened to challenge the eu stance in a panel before the wto in september .
they say the five-year ban on introducing genetically modified products in the european union has already cost u.s. farmers and food producers at least $ 300 million per year .
in the united states , genetically altered products have long been sold without any special consumer label .
an obligatory label that would have to say " genetically altered ingredients , " as the eu ordered earlier in july , is completely unacceptable , because it is expensive and would scare off consumers , the americans argue .
' no social concensus ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler on monday , fischler made a goodwill tour of washington to address the problem , meeting with u.s. trade representative robert zoellick and agriculture secretary ann veneman .
following those meetings , he spoke to an an international assembly of farm lobbyists and diplomats , explaining europe 's position : " if we are not prepared to give consumers a real choice , so that they can decide for themselves if they want to buy chemical products or some other products , if we do n't make sure of that , then there is simply no social consensus in europe for accepting gm products , " fischler said .

a further point under discussion in montreal was product names .

international attention on guantanamo bay is set to intensify further after concessions by washington to london on british prisoners in guantanamo came to light last week .
the u.s. said that it would not seek the death penalty for two british detainees after sustained pressure from the british government .
wolfgang heinz , co-author of the institute ’ s study , said the decision by the u.s. was " important as it sets a precedent that many other countries -lrb- with prisoners in the u.s. base in cuba -rrb- will now follow up on . "
concessions seen to favor allies heinz said the decision was problematic as washington would almost certainly not extend the concession to other countries , beyond australia and pakistan , already in talks with the u.s. this would create the impression of granting special favors to close allies , he said .
accusing both the u.s. and britain of ignoring human rights issues in the anti-terror campaign , in afghanistan and elsewhere , heinz called for independent monitors - from the un among others - to be dispatched with american , british or german troops involved in these campaigns , to check whether soldiers are involved in abuses and to gather information from service personnel on abuses they observe .

genetically altered corn the latest round in the long fight over genetically manipulated foods ended wednesday in a stalemate , as a three-day world trade organization mini-summit ended in montreal . at the montreal meeting , 25 trade and agriculture ministers from around the world attempted to pave the way for the planned wto summit in cancun , mexico , in september .
the idea behind the mini-summit was to lay the groundwork on some sticky issues in order to make greater strides in september .
among the most intractable of these issues is genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods .
the european union has sought to forbid the sale of such foods in the name of consumer protection ; but the united states says europe maintains a de facto ban on gm foods , without any scientific basis .
free trade and self-regulation should steer the market , the united states says .
opposing viewpoints eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler initially sought transatlantic cooperation at the montreal meeting , noting that just this month the eu had decided to allow the sale of genetically modified foods in europe – provided they came labeled as such , which in the eyes of the eu means a product containing more than 0.9 percent genetically altered proteins or dna .
yet u.s. farmers and food producers have threatened to challenge the eu stance in a panel before the wto in september .
they say the five-year ban on introducing genetically modified products in the european union has already cost u.s. farmers and food producers at least $ 300 million per year .
in the united states , genetically altered products have long been sold without any special consumer label .
an obligatory label that would have to say " genetically altered ingredients , " as the eu ordered earlier in july , is completely unacceptable , because it is expensive and would scare off consumers , the americans argue .
' no social concensus ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler on monday , fischler made a goodwill tour of washington to address the problem , meeting with u.s. trade representative robert zoellick and agriculture secretary ann veneman .
following those meetings , he spoke to an an international assembly of farm lobbyists and diplomats , explaining europe 's position : " if we are not prepared to give consumers a real choice , so that they can decide for themselves if they want to buy chemical products or some other products , if we do n't make sure of that , then there is simply no social consensus in europe for accepting gm products , " fischler said .
what 's in a name ?
a further point under discussion in montreal was product names .
the eu wants world-wide protection for the names of 36 regional products , from bordeaux wine to parma ham .
the u.s. calls this protectionism ; fischler protests .
" we simply do n't agree that , for example , the maker of parma ham ca n't export the product to canada and have it sold under the name of parma ham , simply because some clever businessman in canada thought of securing the rights to that name , " fischler said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm food debate rears its head again genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.07.2003 german human rights report criticizes united states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the treatment of suspected terrorists in u.s. custody is once more called into question international pressure on the united states ’ approach to the war on terror is set to increase after a human rights watchdog in germany issued a damning report of u.s. infringements . as president george w. bush ’ s mission to dismantle terror organizations around the world continues to pull the united states into military operations such as afghanistan and iraq , global concern increases about the legal and ethical dilemmas the war on terror leaves in its wake .
a recent report from the german institute for human rights addresses these concerns and criticizes the bush administration for its questionable methods of bringing terrorists to justice and the overall direction the war on terror is taking the u.s. as it tries to prevent further attacks on its soil .
infringing fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 .
the international war on terrorism and human rights report , released on tuesday , claims that the u.s. has been trampling on human rights since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
referring to legislation forced through congress in the wake of the attacks , the human rights watchdog said , " a series of measures taken to combat terrorism are infringing on fundamental human rights , " particularly civil and political rights .
the bush administration is accused of using immigration laws and an expansive definition of the term " enemy combatants " to by-pass the criminal justice system and deny due process safeguards to persons it interrogated and detained as part of its terrorist investigation .
the u.s. government has increased its powers of surveillance , investigation and detention within its own borders after the attacks , and sources quoted in the report suggest these were implemented to block public scrutiny and limit congressional checks and meaningful judicial review .
the authors of the report warn that these harsh steps could eventually prove to be counter-productive and actually boost support for terrorists .
law free islands the report also focuses on the treatment of prisoners held at the guantanamo bay camp in cuba where hundreds of suspected members of al qaeda and afghanistan 's former taliban regime are being held .
the institute criticized what it called " parallel worlds without rights " and " law-free islands " such as the camp x-ray facility in cuba and cooperatively run detention centers in places like pakistan and the philippines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensory deprivation at camp x-ray .
it expresses concern that prisoners held in such places have neither " access to fair legal proceedings " nor " limits on the time they could be held without judicial review . "
the detainees held in cuba are kept in a state of sensory deprivation , refused the right of counsel and face trial in front of military courts with the prospect of being sentenced to death if found guilty of being an " enemy combatant . "
international attention on guantanamo bay is set to intensify further after concessions by washington to london on british prisoners in guantanamo came to light last week .
the u.s. said that it would not seek the death penalty for two british detainees after sustained pressure from the british government .
wolfgang heinz , co-author of the institute ’ s study , said the decision by the u.s. was " important as it sets a precedent that many other countries -lrb- with prisoners in the u.s. base in cuba -rrb- will now follow up on . "

you might not be winning the yellow jersey just yet , but cycling can still be a rewarding experience .
a tour by the rhine offers many delights - all taking a fraction of the energy needed to win the tour de france . if the tour de france is still a little out of your league , then why not try the tour de rhine ?
we ’ re not talking about competitive cycling here , but a leisurely ride down germany ’ s most famous river , taking in the historic roman city of cologne , the former cold war capital of bonn and finishing with a well-earned break in koblenz , at the cross roads of the rhine and mosel . and if pleasant cycling is the order of the day but you still secretly fancy yourself as the next jan ullrich or lance armstrong , then you can always take in the sights dressed head to toe in luminous lycra – many do . after all cycling is seriously good fun in germany , with the emphasis on " seriously . "
germany is a country where leisure is not just a business or pastime , but a fundamental right of the people . one set of leisure seekers that benefits most from this fact are the cyclists .
those enjoying the winding paths of the rhineland area are blessed with a total of 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- of paved , maintained and meticulously-routed cycle highways which snake around and bisect the countryside .
save for a few close calls with nearby autobahns , this route , like most of them in germany , takes in hill and dale , river and stream and , of course , the odd beer garden .
in the footseps of caesar and attila the hun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling means family fun in germany .
as with most things in germany , cycling has its own order .
many routes offer an infrastructure of signs which highlight places of interest for those who don ’ t want to miss anything out .
the route along the rhine is no exception with its romantic vistas and historical legacies .
the paths follow in the sandaled footsteps of julius caesar and his legions who settled along the river at cologne , bonn , nierstein and koblenz , while attila the hun 's butchery hereabouts earned him the nom de guerre " the scourge of god . "
the timbered houses in the cobblestone villages along these banks also witnessed the great plague and the thirty years war .
from time to time , these banks also experience flooding - something to bear in mind before setting out .
beginning the tour in cologne , you have the luxurious choice of two well signposted paths on either side of the river .
taking the “ schäl sick ” or " wrong " side of the river -lrb- that which does not play host to the city center ’ s delights -rrb- is actually the more attractive option to start with as the " right " side takes the koblenz bound cyclist along a number of main auto routes . sooner or later , however , the woods , parks and picturesque watering holes have to be left behind as the route on the “ schäl sick ” comes to an end .
taking one of the small ferries across the rhine , the path continues down to bonn .
wine and legend in the valleys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because cycling should n't be your only pleasure .
crossing the kennedybrücke , the bridge named after john f. kennedy , the tour takes in the opera house and concert hall in bonn , the birthplace of ludwig von beethoven and the post-war german republic .
onwards , the route offers a superb view of the castled crags of the drachenfels , where siegfried in richard wagner ’ s ring saga slayed a dragon and bathed in its blood to make himself invincible .
further on , as the route winds into koblenz , fans of the grape can view the region ’ s vineyards and try the local tipple .
although just one of many bike tours available to enthusiasts visiting the country , the cologne – koblenz route offers a good selection of all that 's good about leisurely cycling in germany : beautiful scenery , historic sights , mythical stories and the opportunity to take a break and sample the great beer , wine and food .

files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .
but bisky denies he worked as an official stasi informant . shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was able to get it hands on hundreds of files belonging to the east german secret police known at the stasi .
over the last three years , the so-called “ rosewood ” files were copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany . since the beginning of july , the documents have been available for public research .
bisky , listed as “ unofficial collaborator ” at the foreign section of the east germany ministry for security , is the first high-profile person to be implicated by the rosewood files . the 61 year-old politician admitted on tuesday he had contact to the secret police but denied he worked as a stasi informant .
he told german ard television there was “ nothing new ” in the latest revelations and that he was only of interest to east german authorities because of his travel abroad . “ i wrote the usual travel reports about my trips to the west for my supervisors and passed them on , ” bisky said .
he said he never signed any documents , which would be required to be a stasi informant . the news couldn ’ t have come at a worse time for bisky , who was re-elected in june to lead the beleaguered party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which rose from the ashes of the east german communist party after german reunification .
bisky headed the pds 1993 to 2000 , but was called back to duty as the party has floundered in recent months .
considered part of the party ’ s more pragmatic wing , being listed in the rosewood files could hurt his effort to get the pds back on track . codename “ bienitz ” according to the weekly newspaper die zeit , bisky , who emigrated from west germany to the communist east in 1959 , worked under the codename “ bienitz ” for the stasi from 1966 to 1979 .
he was then “ reactivated ” in 1986 after he became the director of the once-famous film school in babelsberg near berlin . günter nooke , a conservative member of the german parliament , came to bisky ’ s defense on wednesday , saying as a member of a government investigative committee in the 1990s he had known for years about bisky ’ s connections to the stasi .

files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .
but bisky denies he worked as an official stasi informant . shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was able to get it hands on hundreds of files belonging to the east german secret police known at the stasi .
over the last three years , the so-called “ rosewood ” files were copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany . since the beginning of july , the documents have been available for public research .
bisky , listed as “ unofficial collaborator ” at the foreign section of the east germany ministry for security , is the first high-profile person to be implicated by the rosewood files . the 61 year-old politician admitted on tuesday he had contact to the secret police but denied he worked as a stasi informant .
he told german ard television there was “ nothing new ” in the latest revelations and that he was only of interest to east german authorities because of his travel abroad . “ i wrote the usual travel reports about my trips to the west for my supervisors and passed them on , ” bisky said .
he said he never signed any documents , which would be required to be a stasi informant . the news couldn ’ t have come at a worse time for bisky , who was re-elected in june to lead the beleaguered party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which rose from the ashes of the east german communist party after german reunification .
bisky headed the pds 1993 to 2000 , but was called back to duty as the party has floundered in recent months .
considered part of the party ’ s more pragmatic wing , being listed in the rosewood files could hurt his effort to get the pds back on track . codename “ bienitz ” according to the weekly newspaper die zeit , bisky , who emigrated from west germany to the communist east in 1959 , worked under the codename “ bienitz ” for the stasi from 1966 to 1979 .
he was then “ reactivated ” in 1986 after he became the director of the once-famous film school in babelsberg near berlin . günter nooke , a conservative member of the german parliament , came to bisky ’ s defense on wednesday , saying as a member of a government investigative committee in the 1990s he had known for years about bisky ’ s connections to the stasi .
nooke told the berliner zeitung newspaper the latest details were “ not spectacular enough ” to endanger bisky ’ s political career . although officials tending the rosewood files have warned there will likely be few sensational revelations from the documents , they should fill in some crucial gaps in the extensive investigations of stasi activities .
most files seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .

a recent report from the german institute for human rights addresses these concerns and criticizes the bush administration for its questionable methods of bringing terrorists to justice and the overall direction the war on terror is taking the u.s. as it tries to prevent further attacks on its soil .
infringing fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 .
the international war on terrorism and human rights report , released on tuesday , claims that the u.s. has been trampling on human rights since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
referring to legislation forced through congress in the wake of the attacks , the human rights watchdog said , " a series of measures taken to combat terrorism are infringing on fundamental human rights , " particularly civil and political rights .
the bush administration is accused of using immigration laws and an expansive definition of the term " enemy combatants " to by-pass the criminal justice system and deny due process safeguards to persons it interrogated and detained as part of its terrorist investigation .
the u.s. government has increased its powers of surveillance , investigation and detention within its own borders after the attacks , and sources quoted in the report suggest these were implemented to block public scrutiny and limit congressional checks and meaningful judicial review .
the authors of the report warn that these harsh steps could eventually prove to be counter-productive and actually boost support for terrorists .
law free islands the report also focuses on the treatment of prisoners held at the guantanamo bay camp in cuba where hundreds of suspected members of al qaeda and afghanistan 's former taliban regime are being held .
the institute criticized what it called " parallel worlds without rights " and " law-free islands " such as the camp x-ray facility in cuba and cooperatively run detention centers in places like pakistan and the philippines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensory deprivation at camp x-ray .
it expresses concern that prisoners held in such places have neither " access to fair legal proceedings " nor " limits on the time they could be held without judicial review . "
the detainees held in cuba are kept in a state of sensory deprivation , refused the right of counsel and face trial in front of military courts with the prospect of being sentenced to death if found guilty of being an " enemy combatant . "
international attention on guantanamo bay is set to intensify further after concessions by washington to london on british prisoners in guantanamo came to light last week .
the u.s. said that it would not seek the death penalty for two british detainees after sustained pressure from the british government .
wolfgang heinz , co-author of the institute ’ s study , said the decision by the u.s. was " important as it sets a precedent that many other countries -lrb- with prisoners in the u.s. base in cuba -rrb- will now follow up on . "
concessions seen to favor allies heinz said the decision was problematic as washington would almost certainly not extend the concession to other countries , beyond australia and pakistan , already in talks with the u.s. this would create the impression of granting special favors to close allies , he said .
accusing both the u.s. and britain of ignoring human rights issues in the anti-terror campaign , in afghanistan and elsewhere , heinz called for independent monitors - from the un among others - to be dispatched with american , british or german troops involved in these campaigns , to check whether soldiers are involved in abuses and to gather information from service personnel on abuses they observe .
allegations of involvement in killing and torture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : al qaeda suspect ramzi bin al-shaiba was arrested in pakistan .
based on interviews , press reports , and statements by amnesty international and other non-governmental groups , the institute ’ s study also highlights accusations that pre-trial killing or torturing of alleged al qaeda terrorists in countries such as egypt , pakistan and morocco have involved , or have been tolerated by , u.s. intelligence services . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. and eu reach terrorism accord european justice ministers have agreed to sign a deal that will increase already close cooperation with the united states in the fight against terrorism .

11 , 2001 .
the international war on terrorism and human rights report , released on tuesday , claims that the u.s. has been trampling on human rights since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
referring to legislation forced through congress in the wake of the attacks , the human rights watchdog said , " a series of measures taken to combat terrorism are infringing on fundamental human rights , " particularly civil and political rights .
the bush administration is accused of using immigration laws and an expansive definition of the term " enemy combatants " to by-pass the criminal justice system and deny due process safeguards to persons it interrogated and detained as part of its terrorist investigation .
the u.s. government has increased its powers of surveillance , investigation and detention within its own borders after the attacks , and sources quoted in the report suggest these were implemented to block public scrutiny and limit congressional checks and meaningful judicial review .
the authors of the report warn that these harsh steps could eventually prove to be counter-productive and actually boost support for terrorists .

genetically altered corn the latest round in the long fight over genetically manipulated foods ended wednesday in a stalemate , as a three-day world trade organization mini-summit ended in montreal . at the montreal meeting , 25 trade and agriculture ministers from around the world attempted to pave the way for the planned wto summit in cancun , mexico , in september .
the idea behind the mini-summit was to lay the groundwork on some sticky issues in order to make greater strides in september .
among the most intractable of these issues is genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods .
the european union has sought to forbid the sale of such foods in the name of consumer protection ; but the united states says europe maintains a de facto ban on gm foods , without any scientific basis .
free trade and self-regulation should steer the market , the united states says .
opposing viewpoints eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler initially sought transatlantic cooperation at the montreal meeting , noting that just this month the eu had decided to allow the sale of genetically modified foods in europe – provided they came labeled as such , which in the eyes of the eu means a product containing more than 0.9 percent genetically altered proteins or dna .
yet u.s. farmers and food producers have threatened to challenge the eu stance in a panel before the wto in september .
they say the five-year ban on introducing genetically modified products in the european union has already cost u.s. farmers and food producers at least $ 300 million per year .
in the united states , genetically altered products have long been sold without any special consumer label .
an obligatory label that would have to say " genetically altered ingredients , " as the eu ordered earlier in july , is completely unacceptable , because it is expensive and would scare off consumers , the americans argue .
' no social concensus ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler on monday , fischler made a goodwill tour of washington to address the problem , meeting with u.s. trade representative robert zoellick and agriculture secretary ann veneman .
following those meetings , he spoke to an an international assembly of farm lobbyists and diplomats , explaining europe 's position : " if we are not prepared to give consumers a real choice , so that they can decide for themselves if they want to buy chemical products or some other products , if we do n't make sure of that , then there is simply no social consensus in europe for accepting gm products , " fischler said .
what 's in a name ?
a further point under discussion in montreal was product names .
the eu wants world-wide protection for the names of 36 regional products , from bordeaux wine to parma ham .
the u.s. calls this protectionism ; fischler protests .
" we simply do n't agree that , for example , the maker of parma ham ca n't export the product to canada and have it sold under the name of parma ham , simply because some clever businessman in canada thought of securing the rights to that name , " fischler said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm food debate rears its head again genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban .

genetically altered corn the latest round in the long fight over genetically manipulated foods ended wednesday in a stalemate , as a three-day world trade organization mini-summit ended in montreal . at the montreal meeting , 25 trade and agriculture ministers from around the world attempted to pave the way for the planned wto summit in cancun , mexico , in september .

among the most intractable of these issues is genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods .

starting next year patients in germany will be spared a trip to the pharmacy since they 'll be able to get their prescriptions filled online and mailed to them .
pharmacy groups warn it could endanger patients ' health . proponents of the legalization of mail-order medicine say it has one major advantage - it will lower the costs of health care . patients clicking online to fill prescriptions should pay 10 to 30 percent less for drugs , according to dr. peter weber , who already runs an online pharmacy offering around 10,000 products - mostly vitamins and cough drops , since " real " medicines ca n't yet be sold online under current law . he set up the server for his cyberpharmacy in the backroom of his " real " pharmacy in the city of cologne five years ago and has done a brisk business ever since . " we get about a million hits per month and send out thousands of shipments in that time , " he said .
he hopes he 'll be able to add other medicines to his online selection in the near future .
" think about people with chronic illnesses , who need medicines for diabetes and high blood pressure .
i think it 's possible to send out these kinds of medicines without any risk , " he added . still , weber said , online pharmacies need to have very clear guidelines .
" if they 're legally allowed in germany then there needs to be a quality management system , " he said .
" only real , functioning pharmacies should be allowed to operate online versions and they have to be officially licensed . "
only then could online consultations , either by e-mail or phone , be safeguarded , he said , and would the client be sure he is getting the right medications . patients protecting themselves ? pharmacy associations in germany warn that the introduction of mail-order drugs could be bad medicine for patients .
a " seal of approval " for internet providers has never been successfully established , according to thomas preis , chairman of the north rhine association of pharmacies .
in his opinion , such a scheme would not work for mail-order drug providers either . he categorically rejects any kind of online drug sales , even if a licensed pharmacist is behind the online drug store : " the consumer can not discern whether the drug came through appropriate trade channels .
he ca n't know , where the medicines came from . " he fears that consumers could receive medicines which have passed their expiration date , are of poor quality or only include instructions in a foreign language .
in his opinion , mix-ups are likely . he also rejects the argument that online medicines will end up being less expensive in the long run , saying while online commerce is touted as leading to cost savings , in the end , studies have show the opposite is often true . moreover , weber said , online pharmacies could threaten the existence of their brick and mortar cousins , since they could corner the market on inexpensive drugs .
as a result , real pharmacies would be left with expensive , seldom-used drugs on their shelves in additional to the costs for staffing and consultation .
that , he said , could close them down . positive experience in the netherlands however , dieter hebel , head of gmünder health , sees in a mail-order medicine future the possibility of real savings and perhaps of lowering consumers ' health insurance premiums .
" the pharmacies should not always talk about keeping hold of their monopoly , " he argues .
" rather they should realize that as local service centers , they have a different relationship with customers and can offer them alternatives . " he disagrees that mail-order medicines can pose a danger to the public .
consumers should be able to differentiate which medicines they can buy on the internet and which ones require consultations with a real pharmacist , according to hebel .
he points to experiences in dutch online pharmacies , all of whom have official licensing .

files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .
but bisky denies he worked as an official stasi informant . shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was able to get it hands on hundreds of files belonging to the east german secret police known at the stasi .
over the last three years , the so-called “ rosewood ” files were copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany . since the beginning of july , the documents have been available for public research .
bisky , listed as “ unofficial collaborator ” at the foreign section of the east germany ministry for security , is the first high-profile person to be implicated by the rosewood files . the 61 year-old politician admitted on tuesday he had contact to the secret police but denied he worked as a stasi informant .
he told german ard television there was “ nothing new ” in the latest revelations and that he was only of interest to east german authorities because of his travel abroad . “ i wrote the usual travel reports about my trips to the west for my supervisors and passed them on , ” bisky said .
he said he never signed any documents , which would be required to be a stasi informant . the news couldn ’ t have come at a worse time for bisky , who was re-elected in june to lead the beleaguered party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which rose from the ashes of the east german communist party after german reunification .
bisky headed the pds 1993 to 2000 , but was called back to duty as the party has floundered in recent months .
considered part of the party ’ s more pragmatic wing , being listed in the rosewood files could hurt his effort to get the pds back on track . codename “ bienitz ” according to the weekly newspaper die zeit , bisky , who emigrated from west germany to the communist east in 1959 , worked under the codename “ bienitz ” for the stasi from 1966 to 1979 .
he was then “ reactivated ” in 1986 after he became the director of the once-famous film school in babelsberg near berlin . günter nooke , a conservative member of the german parliament , came to bisky ’ s defense on wednesday , saying as a member of a government investigative committee in the 1990s he had known for years about bisky ’ s connections to the stasi .
nooke told the berliner zeitung newspaper the latest details were “ not spectacular enough ” to endanger bisky ’ s political career . although officials tending the rosewood files have warned there will likely be few sensational revelations from the documents , they should fill in some crucial gaps in the extensive investigations of stasi activities .
most files seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the codenames . officials believe that of the some 200,000 names included on the card index , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 are east germans who worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west . after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
but as some documents came to light after 1990 , many stasi informers were outted , leading to bitter recriminations among co-workers , neighbors and even family members .
millions of people are estimated to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .
the secret police often used draconian methods to persuade or intimidating ordinary people to spy on their neighbors and friends . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies the cia recently handed over sensitive files that name thousands of former east german secret service agents to germany .

files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .
but bisky denies he worked as an official stasi informant . shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was able to get it hands on hundreds of files belonging to the east german secret police known at the stasi .
over the last three years , the so-called “ rosewood ” files were copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany . since the beginning of july , the documents have been available for public research .
bisky , listed as “ unofficial collaborator ” at the foreign section of the east germany ministry for security , is the first high-profile person to be implicated by the rosewood files . the 61 year-old politician admitted on tuesday he had contact to the secret police but denied he worked as a stasi informant .
he told german ard television there was “ nothing new ” in the latest revelations and that he was only of interest to east german authorities because of his travel abroad . “ i wrote the usual travel reports about my trips to the west for my supervisors and passed them on , ” bisky said .
he said he never signed any documents , which would be required to be a stasi informant . the news couldn ’ t have come at a worse time for bisky , who was re-elected in june to lead the beleaguered party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which rose from the ashes of the east german communist party after german reunification .
bisky headed the pds 1993 to 2000 , but was called back to duty as the party has floundered in recent months .
considered part of the party ’ s more pragmatic wing , being listed in the rosewood files could hurt his effort to get the pds back on track . codename “ bienitz ” according to the weekly newspaper die zeit , bisky , who emigrated from west germany to the communist east in 1959 , worked under the codename “ bienitz ” for the stasi from 1966 to 1979 .
he was then “ reactivated ” in 1986 after he became the director of the once-famous film school in babelsberg near berlin . günter nooke , a conservative member of the german parliament , came to bisky ’ s defense on wednesday , saying as a member of a government investigative committee in the 1990s he had known for years about bisky ’ s connections to the stasi .
nooke told the berliner zeitung newspaper the latest details were “ not spectacular enough ” to endanger bisky ’ s political career . although officials tending the rosewood files have warned there will likely be few sensational revelations from the documents , they should fill in some crucial gaps in the extensive investigations of stasi activities .

starting next year patients in germany will be spared a trip to the pharmacy since they 'll be able to get their prescriptions filled online and mailed to them .
pharmacy groups warn it could endanger patients ' health . proponents of the legalization of mail-order medicine say it has one major advantage - it will lower the costs of health care . patients clicking online to fill prescriptions should pay 10 to 30 percent less for drugs , according to dr. peter weber , who already runs an online pharmacy offering around 10,000 products - mostly vitamins and cough drops , since " real " medicines ca n't yet be sold online under current law . he set up the server for his cyberpharmacy in the backroom of his " real " pharmacy in the city of cologne five years ago and has done a brisk business ever since . " we get about a million hits per month and send out thousands of shipments in that time , " he said .
he hopes he 'll be able to add other medicines to his online selection in the near future .
" think about people with chronic illnesses , who need medicines for diabetes and high blood pressure .
i think it 's possible to send out these kinds of medicines without any risk , " he added . still , weber said , online pharmacies need to have very clear guidelines .
" if they 're legally allowed in germany then there needs to be a quality management system , " he said .
" only real , functioning pharmacies should be allowed to operate online versions and they have to be officially licensed . "
only then could online consultations , either by e-mail or phone , be safeguarded , he said , and would the client be sure he is getting the right medications . patients protecting themselves ? pharmacy associations in germany warn that the introduction of mail-order drugs could be bad medicine for patients .
a " seal of approval " for internet providers has never been successfully established , according to thomas preis , chairman of the north rhine association of pharmacies .
in his opinion , such a scheme would not work for mail-order drug providers either . he categorically rejects any kind of online drug sales , even if a licensed pharmacist is behind the online drug store : " the consumer can not discern whether the drug came through appropriate trade channels .
he ca n't know , where the medicines came from . " he fears that consumers could receive medicines which have passed their expiration date , are of poor quality or only include instructions in a foreign language .
in his opinion , mix-ups are likely . he also rejects the argument that online medicines will end up being less expensive in the long run , saying while online commerce is touted as leading to cost savings , in the end , studies have show the opposite is often true . moreover , weber said , online pharmacies could threaten the existence of their brick and mortar cousins , since they could corner the market on inexpensive drugs .
as a result , real pharmacies would be left with expensive , seldom-used drugs on their shelves in additional to the costs for staffing and consultation .
that , he said , could close them down . positive experience in the netherlands however , dieter hebel , head of gmünder health , sees in a mail-order medicine future the possibility of real savings and perhaps of lowering consumers ' health insurance premiums .
" the pharmacies should not always talk about keeping hold of their monopoly , " he argues .
" rather they should realize that as local service centers , they have a different relationship with customers and can offer them alternatives . " he disagrees that mail-order medicines can pose a danger to the public .
consumers should be able to differentiate which medicines they can buy on the internet and which ones require consultations with a real pharmacist , according to hebel .
he points to experiences in dutch online pharmacies , all of whom have official licensing .

germany is a country where leisure is not just a business or pastime , but a fundamental right of the people . one set of leisure seekers that benefits most from this fact are the cyclists .
those enjoying the winding paths of the rhineland area are blessed with a total of 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- of paved , maintained and meticulously-routed cycle highways which snake around and bisect the countryside .

as with most things in germany , cycling has its own order .
many routes offer an infrastructure of signs which highlight places of interest for those who don ’ t want to miss anything out .
the route along the rhine is no exception with its romantic vistas and historical legacies .
the paths follow in the sandaled footsteps of julius caesar and his legions who settled along the river at cologne , bonn , nierstein and koblenz , while attila the hun 's butchery hereabouts earned him the nom de guerre " the scourge of god . "
the timbered houses in the cobblestone villages along these banks also witnessed the great plague and the thirty years war .
from time to time , these banks also experience flooding - something to bear in mind before setting out .

taking the “ schäl sick ” or " wrong " side of the river -lrb- that which does not play host to the city center ’ s delights -rrb- is actually the more attractive option to start with as the " right " side takes the koblenz bound cyclist along a number of main auto routes . sooner or later , however , the woods , parks and picturesque watering holes have to be left behind as the route on the “ schäl sick ” comes to an end .

crossing the kennedybrücke , the bridge named after john f. kennedy , the tour takes in the opera house and concert hall in bonn , the birthplace of ludwig von beethoven and the post-war german republic .
onwards , the route offers a superb view of the castled crags of the drachenfels , where siegfried in richard wagner ’ s ring saga slayed a dragon and bathed in its blood to make himself invincible .
further on , as the route winds into koblenz , fans of the grape can view the region ’ s vineyards and try the local tipple .
although just one of many bike tours available to enthusiasts visiting the country , the cologne – koblenz route offers a good selection of all that 's good about leisurely cycling in germany : beautiful scenery , historic sights , mythical stories and the opportunity to take a break and sample the great beer , wine and food .

you might not be winning the yellow jersey just yet , but cycling can still be a rewarding experience .
a tour by the rhine offers many delights - all taking a fraction of the energy needed to win the tour de france . if the tour de france is still a little out of your league , then why not try the tour de rhine ?
we ’ re not talking about competitive cycling here , but a leisurely ride down germany ’ s most famous river , taking in the historic roman city of cologne , the former cold war capital of bonn and finishing with a well-earned break in koblenz , at the cross roads of the rhine and mosel . and if pleasant cycling is the order of the day but you still secretly fancy yourself as the next jan ullrich or lance armstrong , then you can always take in the sights dressed head to toe in luminous lycra – many do . after all cycling is seriously good fun in germany , with the emphasis on " seriously . "
germany is a country where leisure is not just a business or pastime , but a fundamental right of the people . one set of leisure seekers that benefits most from this fact are the cyclists .
those enjoying the winding paths of the rhineland area are blessed with a total of 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- of paved , maintained and meticulously-routed cycle highways which snake around and bisect the countryside .
save for a few close calls with nearby autobahns , this route , like most of them in germany , takes in hill and dale , river and stream and , of course , the odd beer garden .
in the footseps of caesar and attila the hun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling means family fun in germany .
as with most things in germany , cycling has its own order .
many routes offer an infrastructure of signs which highlight places of interest for those who don ’ t want to miss anything out .
the route along the rhine is no exception with its romantic vistas and historical legacies .
the paths follow in the sandaled footsteps of julius caesar and his legions who settled along the river at cologne , bonn , nierstein and koblenz , while attila the hun 's butchery hereabouts earned him the nom de guerre " the scourge of god . "

files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .
but bisky denies he worked as an official stasi informant . shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was able to get it hands on hundreds of files belonging to the east german secret police known at the stasi .
over the last three years , the so-called “ rosewood ” files were copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany . since the beginning of july , the documents have been available for public research .
bisky , listed as “ unofficial collaborator ” at the foreign section of the east germany ministry for security , is the first high-profile person to be implicated by the rosewood files . the 61 year-old politician admitted on tuesday he had contact to the secret police but denied he worked as a stasi informant .
he told german ard television there was “ nothing new ” in the latest revelations and that he was only of interest to east german authorities because of his travel abroad . “ i wrote the usual travel reports about my trips to the west for my supervisors and passed them on , ” bisky said .
he said he never signed any documents , which would be required to be a stasi informant . the news couldn ’ t have come at a worse time for bisky , who was re-elected in june to lead the beleaguered party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which rose from the ashes of the east german communist party after german reunification .
bisky headed the pds 1993 to 2000 , but was called back to duty as the party has floundered in recent months .
considered part of the party ’ s more pragmatic wing , being listed in the rosewood files could hurt his effort to get the pds back on track . codename “ bienitz ” according to the weekly newspaper die zeit , bisky , who emigrated from west germany to the communist east in 1959 , worked under the codename “ bienitz ” for the stasi from 1966 to 1979 .
he was then “ reactivated ” in 1986 after he became the director of the once-famous film school in babelsberg near berlin . günter nooke , a conservative member of the german parliament , came to bisky ’ s defense on wednesday , saying as a member of a government investigative committee in the 1990s he had known for years about bisky ’ s connections to the stasi .
nooke told the berliner zeitung newspaper the latest details were “ not spectacular enough ” to endanger bisky ’ s political career . although officials tending the rosewood files have warned there will likely be few sensational revelations from the documents , they should fill in some crucial gaps in the extensive investigations of stasi activities .
most files seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the codenames . officials believe that of the some 200,000 names included on the card index , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 are east germans who worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west . after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
but as some documents came to light after 1990 , many stasi informers were outted , leading to bitter recriminations among co-workers , neighbors and even family members .
millions of people are estimated to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .

infringing fundamental rights bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sept .
11 , 2001 .
the international war on terrorism and human rights report , released on tuesday , claims that the u.s. has been trampling on human rights since the terrorist attacks on new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 .
referring to legislation forced through congress in the wake of the attacks , the human rights watchdog said , " a series of measures taken to combat terrorism are infringing on fundamental human rights , " particularly civil and political rights .
the bush administration is accused of using immigration laws and an expansive definition of the term " enemy combatants " to by-pass the criminal justice system and deny due process safeguards to persons it interrogated and detained as part of its terrorist investigation .
the u.s. government has increased its powers of surveillance , investigation and detention within its own borders after the attacks , and sources quoted in the report suggest these were implemented to block public scrutiny and limit congressional checks and meaningful judicial review .
the authors of the report warn that these harsh steps could eventually prove to be counter-productive and actually boost support for terrorists .
law free islands the report also focuses on the treatment of prisoners held at the guantanamo bay camp in cuba where hundreds of suspected members of al qaeda and afghanistan 's former taliban regime are being held .
the institute criticized what it called " parallel worlds without rights " and " law-free islands " such as the camp x-ray facility in cuba and cooperatively run detention centers in places like pakistan and the philippines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sensory deprivation at camp x-ray .
it expresses concern that prisoners held in such places have neither " access to fair legal proceedings " nor " limits on the time they could be held without judicial review . "
the detainees held in cuba are kept in a state of sensory deprivation , refused the right of counsel and face trial in front of military courts with the prospect of being sentenced to death if found guilty of being an " enemy combatant . "
international attention on guantanamo bay is set to intensify further after concessions by washington to london on british prisoners in guantanamo came to light last week .
the u.s. said that it would not seek the death penalty for two british detainees after sustained pressure from the british government .
wolfgang heinz , co-author of the institute ’ s study , said the decision by the u.s. was " important as it sets a precedent that many other countries -lrb- with prisoners in the u.s. base in cuba -rrb- will now follow up on . "
concessions seen to favor allies heinz said the decision was problematic as washington would almost certainly not extend the concession to other countries , beyond australia and pakistan , already in talks with the u.s. this would create the impression of granting special favors to close allies , he said .
accusing both the u.s. and britain of ignoring human rights issues in the anti-terror campaign , in afghanistan and elsewhere , heinz called for independent monitors - from the un among others - to be dispatched with american , british or german troops involved in these campaigns , to check whether soldiers are involved in abuses and to gather information from service personnel on abuses they observe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 30.07.2003 genetically modified food still hot topic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ' maize ' ing - or just scary ?
genetically altered corn the latest round in the long fight over genetically manipulated foods ended wednesday in a stalemate , as a three-day world trade organization mini-summit ended in montreal . at the montreal meeting , 25 trade and agriculture ministers from around the world attempted to pave the way for the planned wto summit in cancun , mexico , in september .
the idea behind the mini-summit was to lay the groundwork on some sticky issues in order to make greater strides in september .
among the most intractable of these issues is genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods .
the european union has sought to forbid the sale of such foods in the name of consumer protection ; but the united states says europe maintains a de facto ban on gm foods , without any scientific basis .
free trade and self-regulation should steer the market , the united states says .
opposing viewpoints eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler initially sought transatlantic cooperation at the montreal meeting , noting that just this month the eu had decided to allow the sale of genetically modified foods in europe – provided they came labeled as such , which in the eyes of the eu means a product containing more than 0.9 percent genetically altered proteins or dna .
yet u.s. farmers and food producers have threatened to challenge the eu stance in a panel before the wto in september .
they say the five-year ban on introducing genetically modified products in the european union has already cost u.s. farmers and food producers at least $ 300 million per year .
in the united states , genetically altered products have long been sold without any special consumer label .
an obligatory label that would have to say " genetically altered ingredients , " as the eu ordered earlier in july , is completely unacceptable , because it is expensive and would scare off consumers , the americans argue .
' no social concensus ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler on monday , fischler made a goodwill tour of washington to address the problem , meeting with u.s. trade representative robert zoellick and agriculture secretary ann veneman .
following those meetings , he spoke to an an international assembly of farm lobbyists and diplomats , explaining europe 's position : " if we are not prepared to give consumers a real choice , so that they can decide for themselves if they want to buy chemical products or some other products , if we do n't make sure of that , then there is simply no social consensus in europe for accepting gm products , " fischler said .
what 's in a name ?
a further point under discussion in montreal was product names .
the eu wants world-wide protection for the names of 36 regional products , from bordeaux wine to parma ham .
the u.s. calls this protectionism ; fischler protests .
" we simply do n't agree that , for example , the maker of parma ham ca n't export the product to canada and have it sold under the name of parma ham , simply because some clever businessman in canada thought of securing the rights to that name , " fischler said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm food debate rears its head again genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban .

genetically altered corn the latest round in the long fight over genetically manipulated foods ended wednesday in a stalemate , as a three-day world trade organization mini-summit ended in montreal . at the montreal meeting , 25 trade and agriculture ministers from around the world attempted to pave the way for the planned wto summit in cancun , mexico , in september .
the idea behind the mini-summit was to lay the groundwork on some sticky issues in order to make greater strides in september .
among the most intractable of these issues is genetically modified -lrb- gm -rrb- foods .
the european union has sought to forbid the sale of such foods in the name of consumer protection ; but the united states says europe maintains a de facto ban on gm foods , without any scientific basis .
free trade and self-regulation should steer the market , the united states says .
opposing viewpoints eu agricultural commissioner franz fischler initially sought transatlantic cooperation at the montreal meeting , noting that just this month the eu had decided to allow the sale of genetically modified foods in europe – provided they came labeled as such , which in the eyes of the eu means a product containing more than 0.9 percent genetically altered proteins or dna .
yet u.s. farmers and food producers have threatened to challenge the eu stance in a panel before the wto in september .
they say the five-year ban on introducing genetically modified products in the european union has already cost u.s. farmers and food producers at least $ 300 million per year .
in the united states , genetically altered products have long been sold without any special consumer label .
an obligatory label that would have to say " genetically altered ingredients , " as the eu ordered earlier in july , is completely unacceptable , because it is expensive and would scare off consumers , the americans argue .
' no social concensus ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz fischler on monday , fischler made a goodwill tour of washington to address the problem , meeting with u.s. trade representative robert zoellick and agriculture secretary ann veneman .
following those meetings , he spoke to an an international assembly of farm lobbyists and diplomats , explaining europe 's position : " if we are not prepared to give consumers a real choice , so that they can decide for themselves if they want to buy chemical products or some other products , if we do n't make sure of that , then there is simply no social consensus in europe for accepting gm products , " fischler said .
what 's in a name ?
a further point under discussion in montreal was product names .
the eu wants world-wide protection for the names of 36 regional products , from bordeaux wine to parma ham .
the u.s. calls this protectionism ; fischler protests .
" we simply do n't agree that , for example , the maker of parma ham ca n't export the product to canada and have it sold under the name of parma ham , simply because some clever businessman in canada thought of securing the rights to that name , " fischler said . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de gm food debate rears its head again genetically-modified food – good or bad ?
the familiar debate is once again the source of intense transatlantic friction this week as u.s. president bush stepped up pressure on the eu to drop its gm ban .

you might not be winning the yellow jersey just yet , but cycling can still be a rewarding experience .
a tour by the rhine offers many delights - all taking a fraction of the energy needed to win the tour de france . if the tour de france is still a little out of your league , then why not try the tour de rhine ?
we ’ re not talking about competitive cycling here , but a leisurely ride down germany ’ s most famous river , taking in the historic roman city of cologne , the former cold war capital of bonn and finishing with a well-earned break in koblenz , at the cross roads of the rhine and mosel . and if pleasant cycling is the order of the day but you still secretly fancy yourself as the next jan ullrich or lance armstrong , then you can always take in the sights dressed head to toe in luminous lycra – many do . after all cycling is seriously good fun in germany , with the emphasis on " seriously . "
germany is a country where leisure is not just a business or pastime , but a fundamental right of the people . one set of leisure seekers that benefits most from this fact are the cyclists .
those enjoying the winding paths of the rhineland area are blessed with a total of 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- of paved , maintained and meticulously-routed cycle highways which snake around and bisect the countryside .
save for a few close calls with nearby autobahns , this route , like most of them in germany , takes in hill and dale , river and stream and , of course , the odd beer garden .
in the footseps of caesar and attila the hun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling means family fun in germany .
as with most things in germany , cycling has its own order .
many routes offer an infrastructure of signs which highlight places of interest for those who don ’ t want to miss anything out .
the route along the rhine is no exception with its romantic vistas and historical legacies .
the paths follow in the sandaled footsteps of julius caesar and his legions who settled along the river at cologne , bonn , nierstein and koblenz , while attila the hun 's butchery hereabouts earned him the nom de guerre " the scourge of god . "
the timbered houses in the cobblestone villages along these banks also witnessed the great plague and the thirty years war .
from time to time , these banks also experience flooding - something to bear in mind before setting out .
beginning the tour in cologne , you have the luxurious choice of two well signposted paths on either side of the river .
taking the “ schäl sick ” or " wrong " side of the river -lrb- that which does not play host to the city center ’ s delights -rrb- is actually the more attractive option to start with as the " right " side takes the koblenz bound cyclist along a number of main auto routes . sooner or later , however , the woods , parks and picturesque watering holes have to be left behind as the route on the “ schäl sick ” comes to an end .
taking one of the small ferries across the rhine , the path continues down to bonn .
wine and legend in the valleys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because cycling should n't be your only pleasure .
crossing the kennedybrücke , the bridge named after john f. kennedy , the tour takes in the opera house and concert hall in bonn , the birthplace of ludwig von beethoven and the post-war german republic .
onwards , the route offers a superb view of the castled crags of the drachenfels , where siegfried in richard wagner ’ s ring saga slayed a dragon and bathed in its blood to make himself invincible .
further on , as the route winds into koblenz , fans of the grape can view the region ’ s vineyards and try the local tipple .
although just one of many bike tours available to enthusiasts visiting the country , the cologne – koblenz route offers a good selection of all that 's good about leisurely cycling in germany : beautiful scenery , historic sights , mythical stories and the opportunity to take a break and sample the great beer , wine and food .

files newly opened to the public show lothar bisky , the head of germany ’ s struggling party of democratic socialism , had ties to the east german secret police .
but bisky denies he worked as an official stasi informant . shortly after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the u.s. central intelligence agency was able to get it hands on hundreds of files belonging to the east german secret police known at the stasi .
over the last three years , the so-called “ rosewood ” files were copied onto 381 cd-roms and sent back to germany . since the beginning of july , the documents have been available for public research .
bisky , listed as “ unofficial collaborator ” at the foreign section of the east germany ministry for security , is the first high-profile person to be implicated by the rosewood files . the 61 year-old politician admitted on tuesday he had contact to the secret police but denied he worked as a stasi informant .
he told german ard television there was “ nothing new ” in the latest revelations and that he was only of interest to east german authorities because of his travel abroad . “ i wrote the usual travel reports about my trips to the west for my supervisors and passed them on , ” bisky said .
he said he never signed any documents , which would be required to be a stasi informant . the news couldn ’ t have come at a worse time for bisky , who was re-elected in june to lead the beleaguered party of democratic socialism -lrb- pds -rrb- , which rose from the ashes of the east german communist party after german reunification .
bisky headed the pds 1993 to 2000 , but was called back to duty as the party has floundered in recent months .
considered part of the party ’ s more pragmatic wing , being listed in the rosewood files could hurt his effort to get the pds back on track . codename “ bienitz ” according to the weekly newspaper die zeit , bisky , who emigrated from west germany to the communist east in 1959 , worked under the codename “ bienitz ” for the stasi from 1966 to 1979 .
he was then “ reactivated ” in 1986 after he became the director of the once-famous film school in babelsberg near berlin . günter nooke , a conservative member of the german parliament , came to bisky ’ s defense on wednesday , saying as a member of a government investigative committee in the 1990s he had known for years about bisky ’ s connections to the stasi .
nooke told the berliner zeitung newspaper the latest details were “ not spectacular enough ” to endanger bisky ’ s political career . although officials tending the rosewood files have warned there will likely be few sensational revelations from the documents , they should fill in some crucial gaps in the extensive investigations of stasi activities .
most files seized from east german authorities only refer to spies by their code names .
for the first time the rosewood files are expected to match real names to the codenames . officials believe that of the some 200,000 names included on the card index , about 12,000 could be those of west germans who spied for the stasi between 1950 and 1989 and 40,000 are east germans who worked as informers and messengers in espionage operations against the west . after the fall of the berlin wall in 1989 , the east german secret police destroyed thousands of files detailing its huge network of spies and informers .
but as some documents came to light after 1990 , many stasi informers were outted , leading to bitter recriminations among co-workers , neighbors and even family members .
millions of people are estimated to have been placed under the stasi ’ s observation during the communist era .
the secret police often used draconian methods to persuade or intimidating ordinary people to spy on their neighbors and friends . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de files could shed new light on east german spies the cia recently handed over sensitive files that name thousands of former east german secret service agents to germany .

starting next year patients in germany will be spared a trip to the pharmacy since they 'll be able to get their prescriptions filled online and mailed to them .
pharmacy groups warn it could endanger patients ' health . proponents of the legalization of mail-order medicine say it has one major advantage - it will lower the costs of health care . patients clicking online to fill prescriptions should pay 10 to 30 percent less for drugs , according to dr. peter weber , who already runs an online pharmacy offering around 10,000 products - mostly vitamins and cough drops , since " real " medicines ca n't yet be sold online under current law . he set up the server for his cyberpharmacy in the backroom of his " real " pharmacy in the city of cologne five years ago and has done a brisk business ever since . " we get about a million hits per month and send out thousands of shipments in that time , " he said .
he hopes he 'll be able to add other medicines to his online selection in the near future .
" think about people with chronic illnesses , who need medicines for diabetes and high blood pressure .
i think it 's possible to send out these kinds of medicines without any risk , " he added . still , weber said , online pharmacies need to have very clear guidelines .
" if they 're legally allowed in germany then there needs to be a quality management system , " he said .
" only real , functioning pharmacies should be allowed to operate online versions and they have to be officially licensed . "
only then could online consultations , either by e-mail or phone , be safeguarded , he said , and would the client be sure he is getting the right medications . patients protecting themselves ? pharmacy associations in germany warn that the introduction of mail-order drugs could be bad medicine for patients .
a " seal of approval " for internet providers has never been successfully established , according to thomas preis , chairman of the north rhine association of pharmacies .
in his opinion , such a scheme would not work for mail-order drug providers either . he categorically rejects any kind of online drug sales , even if a licensed pharmacist is behind the online drug store : " the consumer can not discern whether the drug came through appropriate trade channels .
he ca n't know , where the medicines came from . " he fears that consumers could receive medicines which have passed their expiration date , are of poor quality or only include instructions in a foreign language .
in his opinion , mix-ups are likely . he also rejects the argument that online medicines will end up being less expensive in the long run , saying while online commerce is touted as leading to cost savings , in the end , studies have show the opposite is often true . moreover , weber said , online pharmacies could threaten the existence of their brick and mortar cousins , since they could corner the market on inexpensive drugs .
as a result , real pharmacies would be left with expensive , seldom-used drugs on their shelves in additional to the costs for staffing and consultation .
that , he said , could close them down . positive experience in the netherlands however , dieter hebel , head of gmünder health , sees in a mail-order medicine future the possibility of real savings and perhaps of lowering consumers ' health insurance premiums .
" the pharmacies should not always talk about keeping hold of their monopoly , " he argues .
" rather they should realize that as local service centers , they have a different relationship with customers and can offer them alternatives . " he disagrees that mail-order medicines can pose a danger to the public .
consumers should be able to differentiate which medicines they can buy on the internet and which ones require consultations with a real pharmacist , according to hebel .
he points to experiences in dutch online pharmacies , all of whom have official licensing .

" we get about a million hits per month and send out thousands of shipments in that time , " he said .
he hopes he 'll be able to add other medicines to his online selection in the near future .
" think about people with chronic illnesses , who need medicines for diabetes and high blood pressure .
i think it 's possible to send out these kinds of medicines without any risk , " he added . still , weber said , online pharmacies need to have very clear guidelines .
" if they 're legally allowed in germany then there needs to be a quality management system , " he said .
" only real , functioning pharmacies should be allowed to operate online versions and they have to be officially licensed . "
only then could online consultations , either by e-mail or phone , be safeguarded , he said , and would the client be sure he is getting the right medications . patients protecting themselves ? pharmacy associations in germany warn that the introduction of mail-order drugs could be bad medicine for patients .
a " seal of approval " for internet providers has never been successfully established , according to thomas preis , chairman of the north rhine association of pharmacies .
in his opinion , such a scheme would not work for mail-order drug providers either . he categorically rejects any kind of online drug sales , even if a licensed pharmacist is behind the online drug store : " the consumer can not discern whether the drug came through appropriate trade channels .
he ca n't know , where the medicines came from . " he fears that consumers could receive medicines which have passed their expiration date , are of poor quality or only include instructions in a foreign language .
in his opinion , mix-ups are likely . he also rejects the argument that online medicines will end up being less expensive in the long run , saying while online commerce is touted as leading to cost savings , in the end , studies have show the opposite is often true . moreover , weber said , online pharmacies could threaten the existence of their brick and mortar cousins , since they could corner the market on inexpensive drugs .
as a result , real pharmacies would be left with expensive , seldom-used drugs on their shelves in additional to the costs for staffing and consultation .
that , he said , could close them down . positive experience in the netherlands however , dieter hebel , head of gmünder health , sees in a mail-order medicine future the possibility of real savings and perhaps of lowering consumers ' health insurance premiums .
" the pharmacies should not always talk about keeping hold of their monopoly , " he argues .
" rather they should realize that as local service centers , they have a different relationship with customers and can offer them alternatives . " he disagrees that mail-order medicines can pose a danger to the public .
consumers should be able to differentiate which medicines they can buy on the internet and which ones require consultations with a real pharmacist , according to hebel .

you might not be winning the yellow jersey just yet , but cycling can still be a rewarding experience .
a tour by the rhine offers many delights - all taking a fraction of the energy needed to win the tour de france . if the tour de france is still a little out of your league , then why not try the tour de rhine ?
we ’ re not talking about competitive cycling here , but a leisurely ride down germany ’ s most famous river , taking in the historic roman city of cologne , the former cold war capital of bonn and finishing with a well-earned break in koblenz , at the cross roads of the rhine and mosel . and if pleasant cycling is the order of the day but you still secretly fancy yourself as the next jan ullrich or lance armstrong , then you can always take in the sights dressed head to toe in luminous lycra – many do . after all cycling is seriously good fun in germany , with the emphasis on " seriously . "
germany is a country where leisure is not just a business or pastime , but a fundamental right of the people . one set of leisure seekers that benefits most from this fact are the cyclists .
those enjoying the winding paths of the rhineland area are blessed with a total of 300 kilometers -lrb- 186 miles -rrb- of paved , maintained and meticulously-routed cycle highways which snake around and bisect the countryside .
save for a few close calls with nearby autobahns , this route , like most of them in germany , takes in hill and dale , river and stream and , of course , the odd beer garden .
in the footseps of caesar and attila the hun bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling means family fun in germany .
as with most things in germany , cycling has its own order .
many routes offer an infrastructure of signs which highlight places of interest for those who don ’ t want to miss anything out .
the route along the rhine is no exception with its romantic vistas and historical legacies .
the paths follow in the sandaled footsteps of julius caesar and his legions who settled along the river at cologne , bonn , nierstein and koblenz , while attila the hun 's butchery hereabouts earned him the nom de guerre " the scourge of god . "
the timbered houses in the cobblestone villages along these banks also witnessed the great plague and the thirty years war .
from time to time , these banks also experience flooding - something to bear in mind before setting out .
beginning the tour in cologne , you have the luxurious choice of two well signposted paths on either side of the river .
taking the “ schäl sick ” or " wrong " side of the river -lrb- that which does not play host to the city center ’ s delights -rrb- is actually the more attractive option to start with as the " right " side takes the koblenz bound cyclist along a number of main auto routes . sooner or later , however , the woods , parks and picturesque watering holes have to be left behind as the route on the “ schäl sick ” comes to an end .
taking one of the small ferries across the rhine , the path continues down to bonn .
wine and legend in the valleys bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : because cycling should n't be your only pleasure .
crossing the kennedybrücke , the bridge named after john f. kennedy , the tour takes in the opera house and concert hall in bonn , the birthplace of ludwig von beethoven and the post-war german republic .
onwards , the route offers a superb view of the castled crags of the drachenfels , where siegfried in richard wagner ’ s ring saga slayed a dragon and bathed in its blood to make himself invincible .
further on , as the route winds into koblenz , fans of the grape can view the region ’ s vineyards and try the local tipple .
although just one of many bike tours available to enthusiasts visiting the country , the cologne – koblenz route offers a good selection of all that 's good about leisurely cycling in germany : beautiful scenery , historic sights , mythical stories and the opportunity to take a break and sample the great beer , wine and food .

you might as well have a steak you may have been tempted by the recent warm weather to indulge in your favourite ice cream as a treat , but you could just as well have tucked into a t-bone steak , jacket potato and sour cream .
it sounds shocking , but very few of us are aware of the calorie trap .
we probably know that ice cream and milk shakes contain a lot of fat , but they also contain a staggeringly high number of calories .
we talked to dr ian campbell from the national obesity forum click here to watch our interview in full with dr ian campbell in fact we consume more than two stone in weight of fat every year , and a tub of luxury brand ice cream can contain the equivalent of two day 's worth of fat .
some even have enough calories to wipe out your daily calorific allowance in one go .
so you may be better off tucking into pizzas and burgers than getting caught in the calorie trap .
the washington based centre for science in the public interest -lrb- cspi -rrb- has been researching the issue of hidden calories .
it found one of the more extravagant brands of ice cream cone with chocolate topping contained 320 calories and half the daily intake of fat ; that 's equivalent to a half pound portion of spare ribs .
the ingredients of another desert : coffee ice cream , roasted almonds , fudge , biscuit , peanut butter , and whipped topping ; is the equivalent of two pepperoni pizzas or 1180 calories .
fat facts there are 3500 calories to a pound of fat men should consume a maximum of 2500 calories a day women should consume 2000 a day we 're pre-programmed to enjoy fatty foods when food was scarce , those who could store fat survived luxury ice creams can contain up to 1270 calories , equivalent to a t-bone steak , potato and sour cream obesity costs the nhs £ 500m a year cspi research that included 26 grammes of saturated fat .
the 1180 calories is more than half the daily allowance of 2000 for a woman .
the daily calorie intake for a man is about 2500 calories .
cspi nutritionist jayne hurley says : " it 's as if these ice cream shops were competing with each other to see who could inflict the greatest toll on our arteries and waistlines . "
however a single small serving of ordinary vanilla ice cream only 65 calories and 2 grammes of saturated fat .
information dr ian campbell who is a gp and works for the national obesity forum says he 's not surprised about the amount of fat and high calorie content of foods .
even yoghurts and fizzy drinks contain high calories , but he wants food packaging to be made clearer .
at the moment it 's only compulsory to put nutritional information on foods that claim to be of nutritional benefit .
many manufacturers do label their products , but up to one in three of us are counting the calories at any time , although many do n't take snacks into consideration , so the calories keep adding up .
craving we have a natural tendency to crave fatty foods .
fat can enhance the flavour of food and should amount to a third of our daily consumption , but we should minimise saturated fats .
what health campaigners want is clearer labelling on food packaging with strongly worded warnings .

i travelled to the punjabi city of amritsar to visit the golden temple , the holiest place of worship for the estimated 20 million sikhs living in india as well as the sikh diaspora .
in 1985-86 i had travelled extensively in india , from the tibetan plateau of ladakh in the north , to the deserts of rajasthan , to cape comorin in the south , where you can watch the sun rise over the bay of bengal , and watch it set over the arabian sea .
but at that time the amritsar and the golden temple were strictly off-limits to foreigners .
for the previous year india had been convulsed by some of the worst violence in its modern history .
only those entirely devoid of all spirituality could fail to feel something of the presence of god broadcaster mark tully 's reflections on the golden temple golden temple photo gallery thousands of sikhs were butchered , most in the capital , delhi , after prime minister indira gandhi was assassinated by her sikh bodyguards .
their actions were a response to mrs gandhi 's decision to send the indian army into the golden temple complex to flush out sikh militants fighting for an independent state .
that all seemed a distant memory as i joined an estimated 100,000 people who would pour into the temple complex during the course of a steaming hot sunday in july .
' i feel purified ' the first sight of the temple , surrounded by water and with its golden roof glittering in the sun , is dazzling .
" for sikhs , to come here to bathe , or just make contact with the water is the holiest thing a sikh can do " satpal singh bhatti , a 26-year-old computer engineer from coventry in the english midlands told me .
men take the holy dip in the open , women bathe in closed off compartments every practising sikh aspires to visit the golden temple at least once .
satpal was on his fifth visit .
mandip , a british woman from leamington spa was on her third visit .
" i feel purified , cleansed , " she said .
navjeet kaur , a 21-year-old biology student from california said : " it 's going to help you a lot after you die . "
the atmosphere in the temple complex was one of joy and celebration .
and non-believing outsiders like myself were made to feel very welcome .
" this place is not just for sikhs - muslims hindus or christians can come too , " jaswinder singh jassi , an information officer at the temple , told me .
the one real crush comes after you cross the gurus ' bridge over the water into the temple where the sikhs ' bible , the guru granth sahib , is guarded .
inside visitors make donations and offer prayers as musicians keep up a non-stop rendering of devotional song .
chapatti machine much of the fascination of the site comes from the other buildings that make up the temple complex .
there is an atmosphere of joy in the temple complex facing the golden temple is the six-storey akal takhat , the centre of decision- making in sikhism .
the sikhs themselves tore it down and totally rebuilt it after 1984 because of the damage inflicted by the indian army .
and then there is the enormous communal kitchen where a simple meal of dhal , chapattis -lrb- cooked lentils and unleavened bread -rrb- and water is served free .
a machine there makes up to 6,000 chapattis an hour , i was told .
as i left the temple a young boy with a limited grasp of numbers in english waved some postcards of the temple under my nose .
" one rupee sir , " he asked .
i shook my head .
" ok , five rupees sir ! "
it was a perfect end to a perfect day - and well worth the wait .
postscript : the contrast between the tranquillity of my day in amritsar in 2003 with the violence at the golden temple in the 1980s was brought home later by the veteran broadcaster and writer mark tully .
in his book , no full stops in india , he recalls entering the temple complex in 1984 after the indian army 's operation there .
" the walls were pockmarked with bullet holes .
squash-head shells fired by tanks ... had pulverized the frontage of the akal takhat , leaving hardly a pillar standing ... the floors of the shrine were carpeted with spent cartridges .
the white marble of the pavement ... was stained with blood . "
the shock is all the greater because , as tully so eloquently puts it , the golden temple complex is a place " where only those entirely devoid of all spirituality could fail to feel something of the presence of god " .

" if that is not an issue which needs the investigation of the health minister and his department then i do n't know what is , " he added .
however , the health board defended the decision - and the way it was reached .
a spokesman said the consultation process had been " transparent and robust " .
" we consulted with stakeholders and with the public about what we planned to do , and those consultations were open , " he said .
" difficulties recruiting specialist staff was one of main issues behind the review , along with a need to provide a safe and sustainable service for the population and for mothers . "

" they might have won the fight on tuesday , but we are now going out to take up the battle with health minister malcolm chisholm , " he said .
" this is n't finished yet .
this is just the start of the next stage and we will be fighting the next stage - i can assure you of that . "
duncan mcneil , the labour msp for greenock and inverclyde , said : " this is not the end of the line .
" the decision has to be ratified by the health minister and i will be doing everything in my power to convince him not just to reject this plan , but to institute a full west of scotland-wide review of hospital provision .
" this is the only way to avoid the sort of ludicrous anomalies to which such decisions will lead . "
he said the move would open the door to the centralisation of consultant-led inpatient services for more than 800,000 women and children in two hospitals just seven miles apart .
" if that is not an issue which needs the investigation of the health minister and his department then i do n't know what is , " he added .
however , the health board defended the decision - and the way it was reached .
a spokesman said the consultation process had been " transparent and robust " .
" we consulted with stakeholders and with the public about what we planned to do , and those consultations were open , " he said .
" difficulties recruiting specialist staff was one of main issues behind the review , along with a need to provide a safe and sustainable service for the population and for mothers . "

mgm 's withdrawal has brought a windfall for its shareholders as it had promised to return wealth to them .
they now have the chance to sell their shares at a 25 % above the market price .

his cambodian people 's party -lrb- cpp -rrb- looks set for another term in office following its apparent victory in sunday 's polls , but it is unlikely to secure the two-thirds majority required to rule alone .
however , both the opposition sam rainsy party -lrb- srp -rrb- , and funcinpec , the junior partner in the outgoing cpp-led coalition , have said they will refuse to join a government led by hun sen. similar uncertainty after the 1998 elections led to street protests and violence .
i am still the prime minister , i am still the government cambodian prime minister hun sen on tuesday , the two parties also rejected cpp projections of the final results , alleging widespread irregularities and fraud .
at the latest official tally , results from 77 % of the country put the cpp in front with 49 % of the votes .
the srp was in second place with 22 % , while funcinpec had 20 % .
under cambodia 's complex proportional representation rules , the cpp said it expected to take control of 73 of the 123 seats in the national assembly , nine more than in the last election in 1998 .
final results will not be released until 8 august , but independent poll observers agree with the count , and have broadly approved the electoral proceedings .

and he told a crowd of farmers south-west of the capital , phnom penh : " i am still the prime minister , i am still the government .
" hun sen is strong because he has the support of the people . "
analysts said the situation was ominously similar to that which followed the elections in 1998 , when disputed results ended in mass protests and violence .
the stalemate could continue for months , because even though the national assembly has to meet within 60 days of the elections , there is no constitutional limit on when a new government must be formed .

united utilities wants to build eight wind turbines at lamonby , near penrith .
the mp for penrith and the border david maclean is due to join people from lamonby outside the united utilities annual general meeting in manchester on wednesday .
they are protesting against the 330-feet-high turbines which could be built as close as 550 yards from some houses .
there are concerns the turbines will destroy the landscape and could devalue property prices .
' positive ' image ruth walsh , who chairs the action group communities opposed to lamonby turbines , said : " we want to raise this issue with shareholders and directors going into the meeting .
" some of our members are also shareholders in united utilities , they deliberately bought shares so they could go to the agm , and we are hoping they will be able to raise some questions inside .
" united utilities talk about being a socially responsible company and have a positive image within the community .
" we would say their image in our community is not very positive at the moment and building eight 330 feet wind turbines , 500 metres from peoples ' homes is not very socially responsible . "
united utilities already has planning permission for a weather mast to check if the area is suitable for turbines .
the company added that there are no firm plans for a wind farm yet and said the public would be fully consulted over any proposals .

from 1 august , tourists will be restricted to areas of the wall that are restored and officially designated as tourist sites .
those who stray off the beaten track could face fines .
most of the great wall of china is not as it appears on the television adverts and postcards .
far from it .
most of the wall is in fact in a terrible state of repair .
it is overgrown , worn down by the elements and assaulted by locals who steal its stone .
in the last few years it has begun to be trampled too by hoards of hikers looking for a unique great wall experience .
well , not any more , or so says the chinese government .
from this weekend only officially restored bits of the wall can be visited .
the rest is off limits .
the trouble is the restored bits of the wall are expensive and already overrun by vast numbers of tourists .
locals are already howling in protest .
