kate hoey is joining up to 250 boats and 1,000 campaigners on saturday to demonstrate against a planned 10mph limit on the lake .
the limit will effectively mean the end of sports boats and activities such as water-skiing .
local businesses say it will " devastate " the local economy , which is still struggling to recover from the foot-and-mouth crisis of 2001 .

ms hoey became an opponent of the speed limit while she was sports minister , but she failed to persuade councillors and national park officials to abandon the plan .
she has continued her campaign since through written questions in parliament .
the campaigners have asked for talks with the national park authority to see if windermere can be managed to provide space for fast water sports .
but a report after a public inquiry concluded there was " no conceivable way " in which the lake could be managed to accommodate both large numbers of sports boats and other pursuits such as sailing and canoeing .
the national park authority says it has no intention of reversing its decision .
