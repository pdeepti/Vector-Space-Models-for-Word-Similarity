as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou . when she isn ’ t singing , she ’ s busy exercising her facial muscles in a ear-splitting grin , probably the reason why germany ’ s carrot-haired entry at this year ’ s eurovision song contest looks younger than her 39 years .
the effervescent lou hoffner , who will be belting out a peppy ditty titled " let ’ s get happy " at the eurovision finals in the latvian capital of riga on saturday , claims the song personifies her motto in life .
" it ’ s as if it ’ s made for me and actually it ’ s also my motto in life in all difficult situations , " lou told german news agency dpa .
" it ’ s a song that makes one forget all worries . "
lou 's song composed by eurovision veteran maybe , but the composer of the song is worried enough for germany ’ s hopes at this year ’ s eurovision .
" let ’ s get happy " after all is penned by none other than germany 's dinosaur producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german candidates since 1976 with one lucky hit -rrb- .
the 57-year-old composer , who announced his resignation from the music contest after last year ’ s disastrous performance by german candidate , and siegel protegé , corinna in estonia , has decided to give the competition one more shot .
siegel , together with song-writer bernd meinunger , reportedly approached lou shortly before christmas last year with a " very special song . "
" i ’ m not concerned about how ralph fared last year , whether he was first or last , what ’ s important for me is the international grand prix in riga , " lou said in a recent interview .
and siegel is doing everything he can to ensure that germany ’ s bubbly representative at eurovision this year does well .
" europe must have the feeling that the germans are one hundred percent behind lou , " siegel told the tabloid , bild zeitung .
" childhood dream to sing for germany " the munich-based hoffner , who is a familiar face on the german popular music circuit , is ecstatic about finally making it to the eurovision after narrowly missing a chance two years ago with another siegel classic " happy birthday party . "
" it was always a childhood dream of mine , to sing for germany once , " she said .
born in a family , where singing was a part of life , lou admitted to dpa that as a young girl she used to don her mother ’ s negligee , high-heeled platform shoes and croon into a wooden spoon in front of an imaginary audience .
she later discovered a weakness for hair color , experimenting with all hues before settling on her current flaming orange .
the trained pharmacy assistant said she sang all the time and everywhere she could , even in her sister ’ s pizzeria and local beer tents .
for the past 15 years , she ’ s been touring germany and even abroad with her cover version band " party gang . "
trim , warm lou set to sparkle but it ’ s not just her voice that lou has been training in preparation for the grand prix finals in riga on saturday .
the 5 foot , 3 inches tall singer has also been spending serious time getting into shape .
lou says she ’ s lost 28 kilos in recent months and is giving her designer nightmares about getting her white tuxedo to fit her right for the big night .
and her yogic facial contortions aside , lou also told the bild zeitung on friday that she 'd had a face-lift in a munich cosmetic surgery clinic to get rid of lines on her forehead and around the eyes .
" i 'm so happy with my new face , i admit it because i now simply feel more beautiful , " she said .
the singer is banking on her exuberant presence and the " warm feelings that her song evoke " to help her to success at the eurovision .
" there ’ s so much unhappiness all around us , we must stick together and be friendly and peaceful with each other , then everything will be okay , that ’ s also the message of my song , " she gushed to journalists in riga recently .
" i ’ m just like my song , optimistic and happy . "

as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day . in an interview with public broadcaster ard , german chancellor gerhard schröder called on members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to support his proposed cuts to the german welfare system and labor market reforms or risk being passed up by the times . “ we have to realize that solidarity can only be preserved if we adapt to radical changes in the context of newly defining what the welfare state actually means and what we can still afford in the future , ” he said . spd split over reforms schröder ’ s package of economic reforms known as “ agenda 2010 ” has opened up a nasty split within the 140-year-old party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots .
but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative as german growth has stalled . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . a recent survey showed only half of spd members completely support the government ’ s reform course .
many in the party are also members of trade unions , which flatly reject the government ’ s plans , saying they are “ socially unjust ” and “ neo-liberal ” in design . schröder on friday denied he was abandoning spd social traditions : “ the values themselves don ’ t change , rather just the instruments to achieve them . ” giving in to demands from the party ’ s grassroots , schröder has agreed to hold an spd party congress on june 1 to debate the reforms .
the event has effectively become a vote of confidence , since the chancellor has indirectly threatened to quit if he doesn ’ t not garner the party ’ s support . party support at postwar low despite the party ’ s long history , the debate over agenda 2010 has led the spd to postwar lows of 26 percent in the latest opinion poll .
that miserable showing may eventually convince parliamentary backbenchers to support the government , since toppling schröder and new elections would likely lead to a political bloodbath for the party . over 2,000 guests , including several european center-left leaders , have been invited to berlin to celebrate the founding of german social democracy in the eastern town of leipzig in 1863 .
the anniversary ’ s motto is “ renewal is our tradition , ” in hopes of conveying the current government ’ s reform agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson and schröder .
on wednesday evening , schröder got support for his proposals from british prime minister tony blair and swedish prime minister goran persson , both of which have already pushed through painful reforms at home . " he 's doing the right thing and he will be rewarded , " persson told the reuters news agency .
" as soon as it begins to work , opinion will swing .
i encourage him to go ahead and do it quickly because it will hurt and it will hurt even more if he waits .

as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day . in an interview with public broadcaster ard , german chancellor gerhard schröder called on members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to support his proposed cuts to the german welfare system and labor market reforms or risk being passed up by the times . “ we have to realize that solidarity can only be preserved if we adapt to radical changes in the context of newly defining what the welfare state actually means and what we can still afford in the future , ” he said . spd split over reforms schröder ’ s package of economic reforms known as “ agenda 2010 ” has opened up a nasty split within the 140-year-old party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots .
but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative as german growth has stalled . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . a recent survey showed only half of spd members completely support the government ’ s reform course .
many in the party are also members of trade unions , which flatly reject the government ’ s plans , saying they are “ socially unjust ” and “ neo-liberal ” in design . schröder on friday denied he was abandoning spd social traditions : “ the values themselves don ’ t change , rather just the instruments to achieve them . ” giving in to demands from the party ’ s grassroots , schröder has agreed to hold an spd party congress on june 1 to debate the reforms .
the event has effectively become a vote of confidence , since the chancellor has indirectly threatened to quit if he doesn ’ t not garner the party ’ s support . party support at postwar low despite the party ’ s long history , the debate over agenda 2010 has led the spd to postwar lows of 26 percent in the latest opinion poll .
that miserable showing may eventually convince parliamentary backbenchers to support the government , since toppling schröder and new elections would likely lead to a political bloodbath for the party . over 2,000 guests , including several european center-left leaders , have been invited to berlin to celebrate the founding of german social democracy in the eastern town of leipzig in 1863 .
the anniversary ’ s motto is “ renewal is our tradition , ” in hopes of conveying the current government ’ s reform agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson and schröder .
on wednesday evening , schröder got support for his proposals from british prime minister tony blair and swedish prime minister goran persson , both of which have already pushed through painful reforms at home . " he 's doing the right thing and he will be rewarded , " persson told the reuters news agency .
" as soon as it begins to work , opinion will swing .

as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou . when she isn ’ t singing , she ’ s busy exercising her facial muscles in a ear-splitting grin , probably the reason why germany ’ s carrot-haired entry at this year ’ s eurovision song contest looks younger than her 39 years .
the effervescent lou hoffner , who will be belting out a peppy ditty titled " let ’ s get happy " at the eurovision finals in the latvian capital of riga on saturday , claims the song personifies her motto in life .
" it ’ s as if it ’ s made for me and actually it ’ s also my motto in life in all difficult situations , " lou told german news agency dpa .
" it ’ s a song that makes one forget all worries . "
lou 's song composed by eurovision veteran maybe , but the composer of the song is worried enough for germany ’ s hopes at this year ’ s eurovision .
" let ’ s get happy " after all is penned by none other than germany 's dinosaur producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german candidates since 1976 with one lucky hit -rrb- .
the 57-year-old composer , who announced his resignation from the music contest after last year ’ s disastrous performance by german candidate , and siegel protegé , corinna in estonia , has decided to give the competition one more shot .
siegel , together with song-writer bernd meinunger , reportedly approached lou shortly before christmas last year with a " very special song . "
" i ’ m not concerned about how ralph fared last year , whether he was first or last , what ’ s important for me is the international grand prix in riga , " lou said in a recent interview .
and siegel is doing everything he can to ensure that germany ’ s bubbly representative at eurovision this year does well .
" europe must have the feeling that the germans are one hundred percent behind lou , " siegel told the tabloid , bild zeitung .
" childhood dream to sing for germany " the munich-based hoffner , who is a familiar face on the german popular music circuit , is ecstatic about finally making it to the eurovision after narrowly missing a chance two years ago with another siegel classic " happy birthday party . "
" it was always a childhood dream of mine , to sing for germany once , " she said .
born in a family , where singing was a part of life , lou admitted to dpa that as a young girl she used to don her mother ’ s negligee , high-heeled platform shoes and croon into a wooden spoon in front of an imaginary audience .
she later discovered a weakness for hair color , experimenting with all hues before settling on her current flaming orange .
the trained pharmacy assistant said she sang all the time and everywhere she could , even in her sister ’ s pizzeria and local beer tents .
for the past 15 years , she ’ s been touring germany and even abroad with her cover version band " party gang . "
trim , warm lou set to sparkle but it ’ s not just her voice that lou has been training in preparation for the grand prix finals in riga on saturday .
the 5 foot , 3 inches tall singer has also been spending serious time getting into shape .
lou says she ’ s lost 28 kilos in recent months and is giving her designer nightmares about getting her white tuxedo to fit her right for the big night .
and her yogic facial contortions aside , lou also told the bild zeitung on friday that she 'd had a face-lift in a munich cosmetic surgery clinic to get rid of lines on her forehead and around the eyes .
" i 'm so happy with my new face , i admit it because i now simply feel more beautiful , " she said .
the singer is banking on her exuberant presence and the " warm feelings that her song evoke " to help her to success at the eurovision .
" there ’ s so much unhappiness all around us , we must stick together and be friendly and peaceful with each other , then everything will be okay , that ’ s also the message of my song , " she gushed to journalists in riga recently .
" i ’ m just like my song , optimistic and happy . "
whether all that ebullience will help this year ’ s german contestant to win hearts at the eurovision remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de t.a.t.u – this girl loves that one ?

as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou . when she isn ’ t singing , she ’ s busy exercising her facial muscles in a ear-splitting grin , probably the reason why germany ’ s carrot-haired entry at this year ’ s eurovision song contest looks younger than her 39 years .
the effervescent lou hoffner , who will be belting out a peppy ditty titled " let ’ s get happy " at the eurovision finals in the latvian capital of riga on saturday , claims the song personifies her motto in life .
" it ’ s as if it ’ s made for me and actually it ’ s also my motto in life in all difficult situations , " lou told german news agency dpa .
" it ’ s a song that makes one forget all worries . "
lou 's song composed by eurovision veteran maybe , but the composer of the song is worried enough for germany ’ s hopes at this year ’ s eurovision .
" let ’ s get happy " after all is penned by none other than germany 's dinosaur producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german candidates since 1976 with one lucky hit -rrb- .
the 57-year-old composer , who announced his resignation from the music contest after last year ’ s disastrous performance by german candidate , and siegel protegé , corinna in estonia , has decided to give the competition one more shot .
siegel , together with song-writer bernd meinunger , reportedly approached lou shortly before christmas last year with a " very special song . "
" i ’ m not concerned about how ralph fared last year , whether he was first or last , what ’ s important for me is the international grand prix in riga , " lou said in a recent interview .
and siegel is doing everything he can to ensure that germany ’ s bubbly representative at eurovision this year does well .
" europe must have the feeling that the germans are one hundred percent behind lou , " siegel told the tabloid , bild zeitung .
" childhood dream to sing for germany " the munich-based hoffner , who is a familiar face on the german popular music circuit , is ecstatic about finally making it to the eurovision after narrowly missing a chance two years ago with another siegel classic " happy birthday party . "
" it was always a childhood dream of mine , to sing for germany once , " she said .
born in a family , where singing was a part of life , lou admitted to dpa that as a young girl she used to don her mother ’ s negligee , high-heeled platform shoes and croon into a wooden spoon in front of an imaginary audience .
she later discovered a weakness for hair color , experimenting with all hues before settling on her current flaming orange .
the trained pharmacy assistant said she sang all the time and everywhere she could , even in her sister ’ s pizzeria and local beer tents .
for the past 15 years , she ’ s been touring germany and even abroad with her cover version band " party gang . "
trim , warm lou set to sparkle but it ’ s not just her voice that lou has been training in preparation for the grand prix finals in riga on saturday .
the 5 foot , 3 inches tall singer has also been spending serious time getting into shape .
lou says she ’ s lost 28 kilos in recent months and is giving her designer nightmares about getting her white tuxedo to fit her right for the big night .
and her yogic facial contortions aside , lou also told the bild zeitung on friday that she 'd had a face-lift in a munich cosmetic surgery clinic to get rid of lines on her forehead and around the eyes .
" i 'm so happy with my new face , i admit it because i now simply feel more beautiful , " she said .
the singer is banking on her exuberant presence and the " warm feelings that her song evoke " to help her to success at the eurovision .
" there ’ s so much unhappiness all around us , we must stick together and be friendly and peaceful with each other , then everything will be okay , that ’ s also the message of my song , " she gushed to journalists in riga recently .
" i ’ m just like my song , optimistic and happy . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 23.05.2003 schröder urges reform as spd celebrates 140th anniversary großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blair and other center-left european leaders came to berlin to congratulate schröder and the spd .
as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day . in an interview with public broadcaster ard , german chancellor gerhard schröder called on members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to support his proposed cuts to the german welfare system and labor market reforms or risk being passed up by the times . “ we have to realize that solidarity can only be preserved if we adapt to radical changes in the context of newly defining what the welfare state actually means and what we can still afford in the future , ” he said . spd split over reforms schröder ’ s package of economic reforms known as “ agenda 2010 ” has opened up a nasty split within the 140-year-old party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots .
but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative as german growth has stalled . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . a recent survey showed only half of spd members completely support the government ’ s reform course .
many in the party are also members of trade unions , which flatly reject the government ’ s plans , saying they are “ socially unjust ” and “ neo-liberal ” in design . schröder on friday denied he was abandoning spd social traditions : “ the values themselves don ’ t change , rather just the instruments to achieve them . ” giving in to demands from the party ’ s grassroots , schröder has agreed to hold an spd party congress on june 1 to debate the reforms .
the event has effectively become a vote of confidence , since the chancellor has indirectly threatened to quit if he doesn ’ t not garner the party ’ s support . party support at postwar low despite the party ’ s long history , the debate over agenda 2010 has led the spd to postwar lows of 26 percent in the latest opinion poll .
that miserable showing may eventually convince parliamentary backbenchers to support the government , since toppling schröder and new elections would likely lead to a political bloodbath for the party . over 2,000 guests , including several european center-left leaders , have been invited to berlin to celebrate the founding of german social democracy in the eastern town of leipzig in 1863 .
the anniversary ’ s motto is “ renewal is our tradition , ” in hopes of conveying the current government ’ s reform agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson and schröder .
on wednesday evening , schröder got support for his proposals from british prime minister tony blair and swedish prime minister goran persson , both of which have already pushed through painful reforms at home . " he 's doing the right thing and he will be rewarded , " persson told the reuters news agency .

as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day . in an interview with public broadcaster ard , german chancellor gerhard schröder called on members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to support his proposed cuts to the german welfare system and labor market reforms or risk being passed up by the times . “ we have to realize that solidarity can only be preserved if we adapt to radical changes in the context of newly defining what the welfare state actually means and what we can still afford in the future , ” he said . spd split over reforms schröder ’ s package of economic reforms known as “ agenda 2010 ” has opened up a nasty split within the 140-year-old party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 23.05.2003 happy to sing for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's eurovision entry lou , fresh from a recent face lift , hopes to wow with her buoyant presence .
as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou . when she isn ’ t singing , she ’ s busy exercising her facial muscles in a ear-splitting grin , probably the reason why germany ’ s carrot-haired entry at this year ’ s eurovision song contest looks younger than her 39 years .
the effervescent lou hoffner , who will be belting out a peppy ditty titled " let ’ s get happy " at the eurovision finals in the latvian capital of riga on saturday , claims the song personifies her motto in life .
" it ’ s as if it ’ s made for me and actually it ’ s also my motto in life in all difficult situations , " lou told german news agency dpa .
" it ’ s a song that makes one forget all worries . "
lou 's song composed by eurovision veteran maybe , but the composer of the song is worried enough for germany ’ s hopes at this year ’ s eurovision .
" let ’ s get happy " after all is penned by none other than germany 's dinosaur producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german candidates since 1976 with one lucky hit -rrb- .
the 57-year-old composer , who announced his resignation from the music contest after last year ’ s disastrous performance by german candidate , and siegel protegé , corinna in estonia , has decided to give the competition one more shot .
siegel , together with song-writer bernd meinunger , reportedly approached lou shortly before christmas last year with a " very special song . "
" i ’ m not concerned about how ralph fared last year , whether he was first or last , what ’ s important for me is the international grand prix in riga , " lou said in a recent interview .
and siegel is doing everything he can to ensure that germany ’ s bubbly representative at eurovision this year does well .
" europe must have the feeling that the germans are one hundred percent behind lou , " siegel told the tabloid , bild zeitung .
" childhood dream to sing for germany " the munich-based hoffner , who is a familiar face on the german popular music circuit , is ecstatic about finally making it to the eurovision after narrowly missing a chance two years ago with another siegel classic " happy birthday party . "
" it was always a childhood dream of mine , to sing for germany once , " she said .
born in a family , where singing was a part of life , lou admitted to dpa that as a young girl she used to don her mother ’ s negligee , high-heeled platform shoes and croon into a wooden spoon in front of an imaginary audience .
she later discovered a weakness for hair color , experimenting with all hues before settling on her current flaming orange .
the trained pharmacy assistant said she sang all the time and everywhere she could , even in her sister ’ s pizzeria and local beer tents .
for the past 15 years , she ’ s been touring germany and even abroad with her cover version band " party gang . "
trim , warm lou set to sparkle but it ’ s not just her voice that lou has been training in preparation for the grand prix finals in riga on saturday .
the 5 foot , 3 inches tall singer has also been spending serious time getting into shape .
lou says she ’ s lost 28 kilos in recent months and is giving her designer nightmares about getting her white tuxedo to fit her right for the big night .
and her yogic facial contortions aside , lou also told the bild zeitung on friday that she 'd had a face-lift in a munich cosmetic surgery clinic to get rid of lines on her forehead and around the eyes .
" i 'm so happy with my new face , i admit it because i now simply feel more beautiful , " she said .
the singer is banking on her exuberant presence and the " warm feelings that her song evoke " to help her to success at the eurovision .
" there ’ s so much unhappiness all around us , we must stick together and be friendly and peaceful with each other , then everything will be okay , that ’ s also the message of my song , " she gushed to journalists in riga recently .
" i ’ m just like my song , optimistic and happy . "
whether all that ebullience will help this year ’ s german contestant to win hearts at the eurovision remains to be seen . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de t.a.t.u – this girl loves that one ?

as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day . in an interview with public broadcaster ard , german chancellor gerhard schröder called on members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to support his proposed cuts to the german welfare system and labor market reforms or risk being passed up by the times . “ we have to realize that solidarity can only be preserved if we adapt to radical changes in the context of newly defining what the welfare state actually means and what we can still afford in the future , ” he said . spd split over reforms schröder ’ s package of economic reforms known as “ agenda 2010 ” has opened up a nasty split within the 140-year-old party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots .
but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative as german growth has stalled . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .

as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou . when she isn ’ t singing , she ’ s busy exercising her facial muscles in a ear-splitting grin , probably the reason why germany ’ s carrot-haired entry at this year ’ s eurovision song contest looks younger than her 39 years .
the effervescent lou hoffner , who will be belting out a peppy ditty titled " let ’ s get happy " at the eurovision finals in the latvian capital of riga on saturday , claims the song personifies her motto in life .
" it ’ s as if it ’ s made for me and actually it ’ s also my motto in life in all difficult situations , " lou told german news agency dpa .
" it ’ s a song that makes one forget all worries . "
lou 's song composed by eurovision veteran maybe , but the composer of the song is worried enough for germany ’ s hopes at this year ’ s eurovision .
" let ’ s get happy " after all is penned by none other than germany 's dinosaur producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german candidates since 1976 with one lucky hit -rrb- .
the 57-year-old composer , who announced his resignation from the music contest after last year ’ s disastrous performance by german candidate , and siegel protegé , corinna in estonia , has decided to give the competition one more shot .
siegel , together with song-writer bernd meinunger , reportedly approached lou shortly before christmas last year with a " very special song . "
" i ’ m not concerned about how ralph fared last year , whether he was first or last , what ’ s important for me is the international grand prix in riga , " lou said in a recent interview .
and siegel is doing everything he can to ensure that germany ’ s bubbly representative at eurovision this year does well .
" europe must have the feeling that the germans are one hundred percent behind lou , " siegel told the tabloid , bild zeitung .
" childhood dream to sing for germany " the munich-based hoffner , who is a familiar face on the german popular music circuit , is ecstatic about finally making it to the eurovision after narrowly missing a chance two years ago with another siegel classic " happy birthday party . "
" it was always a childhood dream of mine , to sing for germany once , " she said .
born in a family , where singing was a part of life , lou admitted to dpa that as a young girl she used to don her mother ’ s negligee , high-heeled platform shoes and croon into a wooden spoon in front of an imaginary audience .
she later discovered a weakness for hair color , experimenting with all hues before settling on her current flaming orange .
the trained pharmacy assistant said she sang all the time and everywhere she could , even in her sister ’ s pizzeria and local beer tents .
for the past 15 years , she ’ s been touring germany and even abroad with her cover version band " party gang . "
trim , warm lou set to sparkle but it ’ s not just her voice that lou has been training in preparation for the grand prix finals in riga on saturday .
the 5 foot , 3 inches tall singer has also been spending serious time getting into shape .
lou says she ’ s lost 28 kilos in recent months and is giving her designer nightmares about getting her white tuxedo to fit her right for the big night .
and her yogic facial contortions aside , lou also told the bild zeitung on friday that she 'd had a face-lift in a munich cosmetic surgery clinic to get rid of lines on her forehead and around the eyes .
" i 'm so happy with my new face , i admit it because i now simply feel more beautiful , " she said .
the singer is banking on her exuberant presence and the " warm feelings that her song evoke " to help her to success at the eurovision .
" there ’ s so much unhappiness all around us , we must stick together and be friendly and peaceful with each other , then everything will be okay , that ’ s also the message of my song , " she gushed to journalists in riga recently .
" i ’ m just like my song , optimistic and happy . "

as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day . in an interview with public broadcaster ard , german chancellor gerhard schröder called on members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to support his proposed cuts to the german welfare system and labor market reforms or risk being passed up by the times . “ we have to realize that solidarity can only be preserved if we adapt to radical changes in the context of newly defining what the welfare state actually means and what we can still afford in the future , ” he said . spd split over reforms schröder ’ s package of economic reforms known as “ agenda 2010 ” has opened up a nasty split within the 140-year-old party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots .
but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative as german growth has stalled . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . a recent survey showed only half of spd members completely support the government ’ s reform course .
many in the party are also members of trade unions , which flatly reject the government ’ s plans , saying they are “ socially unjust ” and “ neo-liberal ” in design . schröder on friday denied he was abandoning spd social traditions : “ the values themselves don ’ t change , rather just the instruments to achieve them . ” giving in to demands from the party ’ s grassroots , schröder has agreed to hold an spd party congress on june 1 to debate the reforms .
the event has effectively become a vote of confidence , since the chancellor has indirectly threatened to quit if he doesn ’ t not garner the party ’ s support . party support at postwar low despite the party ’ s long history , the debate over agenda 2010 has led the spd to postwar lows of 26 percent in the latest opinion poll .
that miserable showing may eventually convince parliamentary backbenchers to support the government , since toppling schröder and new elections would likely lead to a political bloodbath for the party . over 2,000 guests , including several european center-left leaders , have been invited to berlin to celebrate the founding of german social democracy in the eastern town of leipzig in 1863 .
the anniversary ’ s motto is “ renewal is our tradition , ” in hopes of conveying the current government ’ s reform agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson and schröder .
on wednesday evening , schröder got support for his proposals from british prime minister tony blair and swedish prime minister goran persson , both of which have already pushed through painful reforms at home . " he 's doing the right thing and he will be rewarded , " persson told the reuters news agency .

as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou . when she isn ’ t singing , she ’ s busy exercising her facial muscles in a ear-splitting grin , probably the reason why germany ’ s carrot-haired entry at this year ’ s eurovision song contest looks younger than her 39 years .
the effervescent lou hoffner , who will be belting out a peppy ditty titled " let ’ s get happy " at the eurovision finals in the latvian capital of riga on saturday , claims the song personifies her motto in life .
" it ’ s as if it ’ s made for me and actually it ’ s also my motto in life in all difficult situations , " lou told german news agency dpa .
" it ’ s a song that makes one forget all worries . "
lou 's song composed by eurovision veteran maybe , but the composer of the song is worried enough for germany ’ s hopes at this year ’ s eurovision .
" let ’ s get happy " after all is penned by none other than germany 's dinosaur producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german candidates since 1976 with one lucky hit -rrb- .
the 57-year-old composer , who announced his resignation from the music contest after last year ’ s disastrous performance by german candidate , and siegel protegé , corinna in estonia , has decided to give the competition one more shot .
siegel , together with song-writer bernd meinunger , reportedly approached lou shortly before christmas last year with a " very special song . "
" i ’ m not concerned about how ralph fared last year , whether he was first or last , what ’ s important for me is the international grand prix in riga , " lou said in a recent interview .
and siegel is doing everything he can to ensure that germany ’ s bubbly representative at eurovision this year does well .
" europe must have the feeling that the germans are one hundred percent behind lou , " siegel told the tabloid , bild zeitung .
" childhood dream to sing for germany " the munich-based hoffner , who is a familiar face on the german popular music circuit , is ecstatic about finally making it to the eurovision after narrowly missing a chance two years ago with another siegel classic " happy birthday party . "
" it was always a childhood dream of mine , to sing for germany once , " she said .
born in a family , where singing was a part of life , lou admitted to dpa that as a young girl she used to don her mother ’ s negligee , high-heeled platform shoes and croon into a wooden spoon in front of an imaginary audience .
she later discovered a weakness for hair color , experimenting with all hues before settling on her current flaming orange .
the trained pharmacy assistant said she sang all the time and everywhere she could , even in her sister ’ s pizzeria and local beer tents .
for the past 15 years , she ’ s been touring germany and even abroad with her cover version band " party gang . "
trim , warm lou set to sparkle but it ’ s not just her voice that lou has been training in preparation for the grand prix finals in riga on saturday .
the 5 foot , 3 inches tall singer has also been spending serious time getting into shape .
lou says she ’ s lost 28 kilos in recent months and is giving her designer nightmares about getting her white tuxedo to fit her right for the big night .
and her yogic facial contortions aside , lou also told the bild zeitung on friday that she 'd had a face-lift in a munich cosmetic surgery clinic to get rid of lines on her forehead and around the eyes .
" i 'm so happy with my new face , i admit it because i now simply feel more beautiful , " she said .
the singer is banking on her exuberant presence and the " warm feelings that her song evoke " to help her to success at the eurovision .
" there ’ s so much unhappiness all around us , we must stick together and be friendly and peaceful with each other , then everything will be okay , that ’ s also the message of my song , " she gushed to journalists in riga recently .

as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day . in an interview with public broadcaster ard , german chancellor gerhard schröder called on members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to support his proposed cuts to the german welfare system and labor market reforms or risk being passed up by the times . “ we have to realize that solidarity can only be preserved if we adapt to radical changes in the context of newly defining what the welfare state actually means and what we can still afford in the future , ” he said . spd split over reforms schröder ’ s package of economic reforms known as “ agenda 2010 ” has opened up a nasty split within the 140-year-old party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots .
but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative as german growth has stalled . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . a recent survey showed only half of spd members completely support the government ’ s reform course .
many in the party are also members of trade unions , which flatly reject the government ’ s plans , saying they are “ socially unjust ” and “ neo-liberal ” in design . schröder on friday denied he was abandoning spd social traditions : “ the values themselves don ’ t change , rather just the instruments to achieve them . ” giving in to demands from the party ’ s grassroots , schröder has agreed to hold an spd party congress on june 1 to debate the reforms .
the event has effectively become a vote of confidence , since the chancellor has indirectly threatened to quit if he doesn ’ t not garner the party ’ s support . party support at postwar low despite the party ’ s long history , the debate over agenda 2010 has led the spd to postwar lows of 26 percent in the latest opinion poll .
that miserable showing may eventually convince parliamentary backbenchers to support the government , since toppling schröder and new elections would likely lead to a political bloodbath for the party . over 2,000 guests , including several european center-left leaders , have been invited to berlin to celebrate the founding of german social democracy in the eastern town of leipzig in 1863 .
the anniversary ’ s motto is “ renewal is our tradition , ” in hopes of conveying the current government ’ s reform agenda . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swedish prime minister goran persson and schröder .
on wednesday evening , schröder got support for his proposals from british prime minister tony blair and swedish prime minister goran persson , both of which have already pushed through painful reforms at home . " he 's doing the right thing and he will be rewarded , " persson told the reuters news agency .

as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou . when she isn ’ t singing , she ’ s busy exercising her facial muscles in a ear-splitting grin , probably the reason why germany ’ s carrot-haired entry at this year ’ s eurovision song contest looks younger than her 39 years .
the effervescent lou hoffner , who will be belting out a peppy ditty titled " let ’ s get happy " at the eurovision finals in the latvian capital of riga on saturday , claims the song personifies her motto in life .
" it ’ s as if it ’ s made for me and actually it ’ s also my motto in life in all difficult situations , " lou told german news agency dpa .
" it ’ s a song that makes one forget all worries . "
lou 's song composed by eurovision veteran maybe , but the composer of the song is worried enough for germany ’ s hopes at this year ’ s eurovision .
" let ’ s get happy " after all is penned by none other than germany 's dinosaur producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german candidates since 1976 with one lucky hit -rrb- .
the 57-year-old composer , who announced his resignation from the music contest after last year ’ s disastrous performance by german candidate , and siegel protegé , corinna in estonia , has decided to give the competition one more shot .
siegel , together with song-writer bernd meinunger , reportedly approached lou shortly before christmas last year with a " very special song . "
" i ’ m not concerned about how ralph fared last year , whether he was first or last , what ’ s important for me is the international grand prix in riga , " lou said in a recent interview .
and siegel is doing everything he can to ensure that germany ’ s bubbly representative at eurovision this year does well .
" europe must have the feeling that the germans are one hundred percent behind lou , " siegel told the tabloid , bild zeitung .
" childhood dream to sing for germany " the munich-based hoffner , who is a familiar face on the german popular music circuit , is ecstatic about finally making it to the eurovision after narrowly missing a chance two years ago with another siegel classic " happy birthday party . "
" it was always a childhood dream of mine , to sing for germany once , " she said .
born in a family , where singing was a part of life , lou admitted to dpa that as a young girl she used to don her mother ’ s negligee , high-heeled platform shoes and croon into a wooden spoon in front of an imaginary audience .
she later discovered a weakness for hair color , experimenting with all hues before settling on her current flaming orange .
the trained pharmacy assistant said she sang all the time and everywhere she could , even in her sister ’ s pizzeria and local beer tents .
for the past 15 years , she ’ s been touring germany and even abroad with her cover version band " party gang . "
trim , warm lou set to sparkle but it ’ s not just her voice that lou has been training in preparation for the grand prix finals in riga on saturday .
the 5 foot , 3 inches tall singer has also been spending serious time getting into shape .
lou says she ’ s lost 28 kilos in recent months and is giving her designer nightmares about getting her white tuxedo to fit her right for the big night .
and her yogic facial contortions aside , lou also told the bild zeitung on friday that she 'd had a face-lift in a munich cosmetic surgery clinic to get rid of lines on her forehead and around the eyes .
" i 'm so happy with my new face , i admit it because i now simply feel more beautiful , " she said .
the singer is banking on her exuberant presence and the " warm feelings that her song evoke " to help her to success at the eurovision .
" there ’ s so much unhappiness all around us , we must stick together and be friendly and peaceful with each other , then everything will be okay , that ’ s also the message of my song , " she gushed to journalists in riga recently .
" i ’ m just like my song , optimistic and happy . "

as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day . in an interview with public broadcaster ard , german chancellor gerhard schröder called on members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to support his proposed cuts to the german welfare system and labor market reforms or risk being passed up by the times . “ we have to realize that solidarity can only be preserved if we adapt to radical changes in the context of newly defining what the welfare state actually means and what we can still afford in the future , ” he said . spd split over reforms schröder ’ s package of economic reforms known as “ agenda 2010 ” has opened up a nasty split within the 140-year-old party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots .
but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative as german growth has stalled . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . a recent survey showed only half of spd members completely support the government ’ s reform course .
many in the party are also members of trade unions , which flatly reject the government ’ s plans , saying they are “ socially unjust ” and “ neo-liberal ” in design . schröder on friday denied he was abandoning spd social traditions : “ the values themselves don ’ t change , rather just the instruments to achieve them . ” giving in to demands from the party ’ s grassroots , schröder has agreed to hold an spd party congress on june 1 to debate the reforms .
the event has effectively become a vote of confidence , since the chancellor has indirectly threatened to quit if he doesn ’ t not garner the party ’ s support . party support at postwar low despite the party ’ s long history , the debate over agenda 2010 has led the spd to postwar lows of 26 percent in the latest opinion poll .
that miserable showing may eventually convince parliamentary backbenchers to support the government , since toppling schröder and new elections would likely lead to a political bloodbath for the party . over 2,000 guests , including several european center-left leaders , have been invited to berlin to celebrate the founding of german social democracy in the eastern town of leipzig in 1863 .

as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day . in an interview with public broadcaster ard , german chancellor gerhard schröder called on members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to support his proposed cuts to the german welfare system and labor market reforms or risk being passed up by the times . “ we have to realize that solidarity can only be preserved if we adapt to radical changes in the context of newly defining what the welfare state actually means and what we can still afford in the future , ” he said . spd split over reforms schröder ’ s package of economic reforms known as “ agenda 2010 ” has opened up a nasty split within the 140-year-old party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots .
but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative as german growth has stalled . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . a recent survey showed only half of spd members completely support the government ’ s reform course .
many in the party are also members of trade unions , which flatly reject the government ’ s plans , saying they are “ socially unjust ” and “ neo-liberal ” in design . schröder on friday denied he was abandoning spd social traditions : “ the values themselves don ’ t change , rather just the instruments to achieve them . ” giving in to demands from the party ’ s grassroots , schröder has agreed to hold an spd party congress on june 1 to debate the reforms .
the event has effectively become a vote of confidence , since the chancellor has indirectly threatened to quit if he doesn ’ t not garner the party ’ s support . party support at postwar low despite the party ’ s long history , the debate over agenda 2010 has led the spd to postwar lows of 26 percent in the latest opinion poll .
that miserable showing may eventually convince parliamentary backbenchers to support the government , since toppling schröder and new elections would likely lead to a political bloodbath for the party . over 2,000 guests , including several european center-left leaders , have been invited to berlin to celebrate the founding of german social democracy in the eastern town of leipzig in 1863 .

on wednesday evening , schröder got support for his proposals from british prime minister tony blair and swedish prime minister goran persson , both of which have already pushed through painful reforms at home . " he 's doing the right thing and he will be rewarded , " persson told the reuters news agency .

as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou . when she isn ’ t singing , she ’ s busy exercising her facial muscles in a ear-splitting grin , probably the reason why germany ’ s carrot-haired entry at this year ’ s eurovision song contest looks younger than her 39 years .
the effervescent lou hoffner , who will be belting out a peppy ditty titled " let ’ s get happy " at the eurovision finals in the latvian capital of riga on saturday , claims the song personifies her motto in life .
" it ’ s as if it ’ s made for me and actually it ’ s also my motto in life in all difficult situations , " lou told german news agency dpa .
" it ’ s a song that makes one forget all worries . "
lou 's song composed by eurovision veteran maybe , but the composer of the song is worried enough for germany ’ s hopes at this year ’ s eurovision .
" let ’ s get happy " after all is penned by none other than germany 's dinosaur producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german candidates since 1976 with one lucky hit -rrb- .
the 57-year-old composer , who announced his resignation from the music contest after last year ’ s disastrous performance by german candidate , and siegel protegé , corinna in estonia , has decided to give the competition one more shot .
siegel , together with song-writer bernd meinunger , reportedly approached lou shortly before christmas last year with a " very special song . "
" i ’ m not concerned about how ralph fared last year , whether he was first or last , what ’ s important for me is the international grand prix in riga , " lou said in a recent interview .
and siegel is doing everything he can to ensure that germany ’ s bubbly representative at eurovision this year does well .
" europe must have the feeling that the germans are one hundred percent behind lou , " siegel told the tabloid , bild zeitung .
" childhood dream to sing for germany " the munich-based hoffner , who is a familiar face on the german popular music circuit , is ecstatic about finally making it to the eurovision after narrowly missing a chance two years ago with another siegel classic " happy birthday party . "
" it was always a childhood dream of mine , to sing for germany once , " she said .
born in a family , where singing was a part of life , lou admitted to dpa that as a young girl she used to don her mother ’ s negligee , high-heeled platform shoes and croon into a wooden spoon in front of an imaginary audience .
she later discovered a weakness for hair color , experimenting with all hues before settling on her current flaming orange .
the trained pharmacy assistant said she sang all the time and everywhere she could , even in her sister ’ s pizzeria and local beer tents .
for the past 15 years , she ’ s been touring germany and even abroad with her cover version band " party gang . "
trim , warm lou set to sparkle but it ’ s not just her voice that lou has been training in preparation for the grand prix finals in riga on saturday .
the 5 foot , 3 inches tall singer has also been spending serious time getting into shape .
lou says she ’ s lost 28 kilos in recent months and is giving her designer nightmares about getting her white tuxedo to fit her right for the big night .
and her yogic facial contortions aside , lou also told the bild zeitung on friday that she 'd had a face-lift in a munich cosmetic surgery clinic to get rid of lines on her forehead and around the eyes .
" i 'm so happy with my new face , i admit it because i now simply feel more beautiful , " she said .
the singer is banking on her exuberant presence and the " warm feelings that her song evoke " to help her to success at the eurovision .
" there ’ s so much unhappiness all around us , we must stick together and be friendly and peaceful with each other , then everything will be okay , that ’ s also the message of my song , " she gushed to journalists in riga recently .

as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day . in an interview with public broadcaster ard , german chancellor gerhard schröder called on members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to support his proposed cuts to the german welfare system and labor market reforms or risk being passed up by the times . “ we have to realize that solidarity can only be preserved if we adapt to radical changes in the context of newly defining what the welfare state actually means and what we can still afford in the future , ” he said . spd split over reforms schröder ’ s package of economic reforms known as “ agenda 2010 ” has opened up a nasty split within the 140-year-old party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots .
but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative as german growth has stalled . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . a recent survey showed only half of spd members completely support the government ’ s reform course .
many in the party are also members of trade unions , which flatly reject the government ’ s plans , saying they are “ socially unjust ” and “ neo-liberal ” in design . schröder on friday denied he was abandoning spd social traditions : “ the values themselves don ’ t change , rather just the instruments to achieve them . ” giving in to demands from the party ’ s grassroots , schröder has agreed to hold an spd party congress on june 1 to debate the reforms .
the event has effectively become a vote of confidence , since the chancellor has indirectly threatened to quit if he doesn ’ t not garner the party ’ s support . party support at postwar low despite the party ’ s long history , the debate over agenda 2010 has led the spd to postwar lows of 26 percent in the latest opinion poll .
that miserable showing may eventually convince parliamentary backbenchers to support the government , since toppling schröder and new elections would likely lead to a political bloodbath for the party . over 2,000 guests , including several european center-left leaders , have been invited to berlin to celebrate the founding of german social democracy in the eastern town of leipzig in 1863 .

as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou . when she isn ’ t singing , she ’ s busy exercising her facial muscles in a ear-splitting grin , probably the reason why germany ’ s carrot-haired entry at this year ’ s eurovision song contest looks younger than her 39 years .
the effervescent lou hoffner , who will be belting out a peppy ditty titled " let ’ s get happy " at the eurovision finals in the latvian capital of riga on saturday , claims the song personifies her motto in life .
" it ’ s as if it ’ s made for me and actually it ’ s also my motto in life in all difficult situations , " lou told german news agency dpa .
" it ’ s a song that makes one forget all worries . "
lou 's song composed by eurovision veteran maybe , but the composer of the song is worried enough for germany ’ s hopes at this year ’ s eurovision .
" let ’ s get happy " after all is penned by none other than germany 's dinosaur producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german candidates since 1976 with one lucky hit -rrb- .
the 57-year-old composer , who announced his resignation from the music contest after last year ’ s disastrous performance by german candidate , and siegel protegé , corinna in estonia , has decided to give the competition one more shot .
siegel , together with song-writer bernd meinunger , reportedly approached lou shortly before christmas last year with a " very special song . "
" i ’ m not concerned about how ralph fared last year , whether he was first or last , what ’ s important for me is the international grand prix in riga , " lou said in a recent interview .
and siegel is doing everything he can to ensure that germany ’ s bubbly representative at eurovision this year does well .
" europe must have the feeling that the germans are one hundred percent behind lou , " siegel told the tabloid , bild zeitung .
" childhood dream to sing for germany " the munich-based hoffner , who is a familiar face on the german popular music circuit , is ecstatic about finally making it to the eurovision after narrowly missing a chance two years ago with another siegel classic " happy birthday party . "
" it was always a childhood dream of mine , to sing for germany once , " she said .
born in a family , where singing was a part of life , lou admitted to dpa that as a young girl she used to don her mother ’ s negligee , high-heeled platform shoes and croon into a wooden spoon in front of an imaginary audience .
she later discovered a weakness for hair color , experimenting with all hues before settling on her current flaming orange .
the trained pharmacy assistant said she sang all the time and everywhere she could , even in her sister ’ s pizzeria and local beer tents .
for the past 15 years , she ’ s been touring germany and even abroad with her cover version band " party gang . "
trim , warm lou set to sparkle but it ’ s not just her voice that lou has been training in preparation for the grand prix finals in riga on saturday .
the 5 foot , 3 inches tall singer has also been spending serious time getting into shape .
lou says she ’ s lost 28 kilos in recent months and is giving her designer nightmares about getting her white tuxedo to fit her right for the big night .
and her yogic facial contortions aside , lou also told the bild zeitung on friday that she 'd had a face-lift in a munich cosmetic surgery clinic to get rid of lines on her forehead and around the eyes .
" i 'm so happy with my new face , i admit it because i now simply feel more beautiful , " she said .
the singer is banking on her exuberant presence and the " warm feelings that her song evoke " to help her to success at the eurovision .
" there ’ s so much unhappiness all around us , we must stick together and be friendly and peaceful with each other , then everything will be okay , that ’ s also the message of my song , " she gushed to journalists in riga recently .

as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou . when she isn ’ t singing , she ’ s busy exercising her facial muscles in a ear-splitting grin , probably the reason why germany ’ s carrot-haired entry at this year ’ s eurovision song contest looks younger than her 39 years .
the effervescent lou hoffner , who will be belting out a peppy ditty titled " let ’ s get happy " at the eurovision finals in the latvian capital of riga on saturday , claims the song personifies her motto in life .
" it ’ s as if it ’ s made for me and actually it ’ s also my motto in life in all difficult situations , " lou told german news agency dpa .
" it ’ s a song that makes one forget all worries . "
lou 's song composed by eurovision veteran maybe , but the composer of the song is worried enough for germany ’ s hopes at this year ’ s eurovision .
" let ’ s get happy " after all is penned by none other than germany 's dinosaur producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german candidates since 1976 with one lucky hit -rrb- .
the 57-year-old composer , who announced his resignation from the music contest after last year ’ s disastrous performance by german candidate , and siegel protegé , corinna in estonia , has decided to give the competition one more shot .
siegel , together with song-writer bernd meinunger , reportedly approached lou shortly before christmas last year with a " very special song . "
" i ’ m not concerned about how ralph fared last year , whether he was first or last , what ’ s important for me is the international grand prix in riga , " lou said in a recent interview .
and siegel is doing everything he can to ensure that germany ’ s bubbly representative at eurovision this year does well .
" europe must have the feeling that the germans are one hundred percent behind lou , " siegel told the tabloid , bild zeitung .
" childhood dream to sing for germany " the munich-based hoffner , who is a familiar face on the german popular music circuit , is ecstatic about finally making it to the eurovision after narrowly missing a chance two years ago with another siegel classic " happy birthday party . "
" it was always a childhood dream of mine , to sing for germany once , " she said .
born in a family , where singing was a part of life , lou admitted to dpa that as a young girl she used to don her mother ’ s negligee , high-heeled platform shoes and croon into a wooden spoon in front of an imaginary audience .
she later discovered a weakness for hair color , experimenting with all hues before settling on her current flaming orange .
the trained pharmacy assistant said she sang all the time and everywhere she could , even in her sister ’ s pizzeria and local beer tents .
for the past 15 years , she ’ s been touring germany and even abroad with her cover version band " party gang . "
trim , warm lou set to sparkle but it ’ s not just her voice that lou has been training in preparation for the grand prix finals in riga on saturday .
the 5 foot , 3 inches tall singer has also been spending serious time getting into shape .
lou says she ’ s lost 28 kilos in recent months and is giving her designer nightmares about getting her white tuxedo to fit her right for the big night .
and her yogic facial contortions aside , lou also told the bild zeitung on friday that she 'd had a face-lift in a munich cosmetic surgery clinic to get rid of lines on her forehead and around the eyes .
" i 'm so happy with my new face , i admit it because i now simply feel more beautiful , " she said .
the singer is banking on her exuberant presence and the " warm feelings that her song evoke " to help her to success at the eurovision .
" there ’ s so much unhappiness all around us , we must stick together and be friendly and peaceful with each other , then everything will be okay , that ’ s also the message of my song , " she gushed to journalists in riga recently .
" i ’ m just like my song , optimistic and happy . "

as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day . in an interview with public broadcaster ard , german chancellor gerhard schröder called on members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to support his proposed cuts to the german welfare system and labor market reforms or risk being passed up by the times . “ we have to realize that solidarity can only be preserved if we adapt to radical changes in the context of newly defining what the welfare state actually means and what we can still afford in the future , ” he said . spd split over reforms schröder ’ s package of economic reforms known as “ agenda 2010 ” has opened up a nasty split within the 140-year-old party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots .
but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative as german growth has stalled . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . a recent survey showed only half of spd members completely support the government ’ s reform course .
many in the party are also members of trade unions , which flatly reject the government ’ s plans , saying they are “ socially unjust ” and “ neo-liberal ” in design . schröder on friday denied he was abandoning spd social traditions : “ the values themselves don ’ t change , rather just the instruments to achieve them . ” giving in to demands from the party ’ s grassroots , schröder has agreed to hold an spd party congress on june 1 to debate the reforms .
the event has effectively become a vote of confidence , since the chancellor has indirectly threatened to quit if he doesn ’ t not garner the party ’ s support . party support at postwar low despite the party ’ s long history , the debate over agenda 2010 has led the spd to postwar lows of 26 percent in the latest opinion poll .
that miserable showing may eventually convince parliamentary backbenchers to support the government , since toppling schröder and new elections would likely lead to a political bloodbath for the party . over 2,000 guests , including several european center-left leaders , have been invited to berlin to celebrate the founding of german social democracy in the eastern town of leipzig in 1863 .

on wednesday evening , schröder got support for his proposals from british prime minister tony blair and swedish prime minister goran persson , both of which have already pushed through painful reforms at home . " he 's doing the right thing and he will be rewarded , " persson told the reuters news agency .

as germany ’ s social democrats gathered to celebrate their 140th anniversary on friday , chancellor gerhard schröder said his party had to be willing to embrace economic reform in order to stay relevant to the present day . in an interview with public broadcaster ard , german chancellor gerhard schröder called on members of his social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- to support his proposed cuts to the german welfare system and labor market reforms or risk being passed up by the times . “ we have to realize that solidarity can only be preserved if we adapt to radical changes in the context of newly defining what the welfare state actually means and what we can still afford in the future , ” he said . spd split over reforms schröder ’ s package of economic reforms known as “ agenda 2010 ” has opened up a nasty split within the 140-year-old party , as left-wing hardliners have accused the chancellor of abandoning the spd ’ s social democratic roots .
but schröder has linked his political future to the unpopular reforms , seeing little alternative as german growth has stalled . in recent years , europe ’ s largest economy has ground to a halt under the weight of its generous welfare system and constricting labor market policies .
economic growth slowed to only 0.2 percent in 2002 and gross domestic product actually shrank in the first quarter of this year .
german unemployment is running at over ten percent . a recent survey showed only half of spd members completely support the government ’ s reform course .
many in the party are also members of trade unions , which flatly reject the government ’ s plans , saying they are “ socially unjust ” and “ neo-liberal ” in design . schröder on friday denied he was abandoning spd social traditions : “ the values themselves don ’ t change , rather just the instruments to achieve them . ” giving in to demands from the party ’ s grassroots , schröder has agreed to hold an spd party congress on june 1 to debate the reforms .
the event has effectively become a vote of confidence , since the chancellor has indirectly threatened to quit if he doesn ’ t not garner the party ’ s support . party support at postwar low despite the party ’ s long history , the debate over agenda 2010 has led the spd to postwar lows of 26 percent in the latest opinion poll .
that miserable showing may eventually convince parliamentary backbenchers to support the government , since toppling schröder and new elections would likely lead to a political bloodbath for the party . over 2,000 guests , including several european center-left leaders , have been invited to berlin to celebrate the founding of german social democracy in the eastern town of leipzig in 1863 .

on wednesday evening , schröder got support for his proposals from british prime minister tony blair and swedish prime minister goran persson , both of which have already pushed through painful reforms at home . " he 's doing the right thing and he will be rewarded , " persson told the reuters news agency .

as candidates from 26 countries get ready to flex their vocal chords at riga for the coveted eurovision crown on saturday , dw-world takes a look at germany ’ s shock-haired , get-happy entry : lou . when she isn ’ t singing , she ’ s busy exercising her facial muscles in a ear-splitting grin , probably the reason why germany ’ s carrot-haired entry at this year ’ s eurovision song contest looks younger than her 39 years .
the effervescent lou hoffner , who will be belting out a peppy ditty titled " let ’ s get happy " at the eurovision finals in the latvian capital of riga on saturday , claims the song personifies her motto in life .
" it ’ s as if it ’ s made for me and actually it ’ s also my motto in life in all difficult situations , " lou told german news agency dpa .
" it ’ s a song that makes one forget all worries . "
lou 's song composed by eurovision veteran maybe , but the composer of the song is worried enough for germany ’ s hopes at this year ’ s eurovision .
" let ’ s get happy " after all is penned by none other than germany 's dinosaur producer and eurovision perennial ralph siegel -lrb- he has written songs for 15 german candidates since 1976 with one lucky hit -rrb- .
the 57-year-old composer , who announced his resignation from the music contest after last year ’ s disastrous performance by german candidate , and siegel protegé , corinna in estonia , has decided to give the competition one more shot .
siegel , together with song-writer bernd meinunger , reportedly approached lou shortly before christmas last year with a " very special song . "
" i ’ m not concerned about how ralph fared last year , whether he was first or last , what ’ s important for me is the international grand prix in riga , " lou said in a recent interview .
and siegel is doing everything he can to ensure that germany ’ s bubbly representative at eurovision this year does well .
" europe must have the feeling that the germans are one hundred percent behind lou , " siegel told the tabloid , bild zeitung .
" childhood dream to sing for germany " the munich-based hoffner , who is a familiar face on the german popular music circuit , is ecstatic about finally making it to the eurovision after narrowly missing a chance two years ago with another siegel classic " happy birthday party . "
" it was always a childhood dream of mine , to sing for germany once , " she said .
born in a family , where singing was a part of life , lou admitted to dpa that as a young girl she used to don her mother ’ s negligee , high-heeled platform shoes and croon into a wooden spoon in front of an imaginary audience .
she later discovered a weakness for hair color , experimenting with all hues before settling on her current flaming orange .
the trained pharmacy assistant said she sang all the time and everywhere she could , even in her sister ’ s pizzeria and local beer tents .
for the past 15 years , she ’ s been touring germany and even abroad with her cover version band " party gang . "
trim , warm lou set to sparkle but it ’ s not just her voice that lou has been training in preparation for the grand prix finals in riga on saturday .
the 5 foot , 3 inches tall singer has also been spending serious time getting into shape .
lou says she ’ s lost 28 kilos in recent months and is giving her designer nightmares about getting her white tuxedo to fit her right for the big night .
and her yogic facial contortions aside , lou also told the bild zeitung on friday that she 'd had a face-lift in a munich cosmetic surgery clinic to get rid of lines on her forehead and around the eyes .
" i 'm so happy with my new face , i admit it because i now simply feel more beautiful , " she said .
the singer is banking on her exuberant presence and the " warm feelings that her song evoke " to help her to success at the eurovision .
" there ’ s so much unhappiness all around us , we must stick together and be friendly and peaceful with each other , then everything will be okay , that ’ s also the message of my song , " she gushed to journalists in riga recently .
" i ’ m just like my song , optimistic and happy . "

the project aims to connect nearly 30 rivers in the country and is estimated to cost over $ 100bn .
it envisages diverting water from surplus river basins to water deficient areas .
floods and drought have become a recurring problem in india and the project is aimed at improving the situation .
last year a severe drought hit several indian states , while floods destroyed people 's harvests in many other areas .
the sharing of river waters has also led to tensions among some states , the most outstanding example being karnataka and tamil nadu .
these two southern states have been fighting for over a century over the cauvery river .
economic benefits india 's bharatiya janata party-led government sees the inter-linking of rivers as a long-term solution to many of these problems .
water for laundering clothes is a perennial problem the party now plans to involve its grass-roots activists in the project .
" we plan to disseminate the idea and educate the masses through our party workers , " the president of the bjp 's youth wing , g kishan reddy , told the bbc .
mr reddy , who is heading the awareness drive , said workers of the youth wing would take the concept to state capitals from where they would spread into the districts and villages .
the bjp says the river-linking project would boost the annual average income of farmers from the present $ 40 per acre of land to over $ 500 .
it says once the rivers are linked , india 's food production will increase from about 200m tonnes a year to 500m .
river treaties but neither the party nor the government led by it offers a specific answer to concerns raised by several environmental bodies .
they argue that the project would alter the basic character of many rivers and leave several hundred thousand people displaced .
they are also silent about how india would gather the resources to convert the grand idea into a reality .
the bjp and its leaders in the government have also ignored , for the time being , the international implications of the project .
india has river treaties with several neighbouring countries which prohibit delhi from unilaterally altering river courses .
for the moment the party is backing the prime minister - who is keen on the project - in the hope that even if water does not reach dry areas , the project would win it votes in key elections this year .

the project aims to connect nearly 30 rivers in the country and is estimated to cost over $ 100bn .
it envisages diverting water from surplus river basins to water deficient areas .
floods and drought have become a recurring problem in india and the project is aimed at improving the situation .
last year a severe drought hit several indian states , while floods destroyed people 's harvests in many other areas .
the sharing of river waters has also led to tensions among some states , the most outstanding example being karnataka and tamil nadu .
these two southern states have been fighting for over a century over the cauvery river .
economic benefits india 's bharatiya janata party-led government sees the inter-linking of rivers as a long-term solution to many of these problems .
the party now plans to involve its grass-roots activists in the project .
" we plan to disseminate the idea and educate the masses through our party workers , " the president of the bjp 's youth wing , g kishan reddy , told the bbc .
mr reddy , who is heading the awareness drive , said workers of the youth wing would take the concept to state capitals from where they would spread into the districts and villages .
the bjp says the river-linking project would boost the annual average income of farmers from the present $ 40 per acre of land to over $ 500 .
it says once the rivers are linked , india 's food production will increase from about 200m tonnes a year to 500m .
river treaties but neither the party nor the government led by it offers a specific answer to concerns raised by several environmental bodies .
they argue that the project would alter the basic character of many rivers and leave several hundred thousand people displaced .
they are also silent about how india would gather the resources to convert the grand idea into a reality .
the bjp and its leaders in the government have also ignored , for the time being , the international implications of the project .
india has river treaties with several neighbouring countries which prohibit delhi from unilaterally altering river courses .
for the moment the party is backing the prime minister - who is keen on the project - in the hope that even if water does not reach dry areas , the project would win it votes in key elections this year .

turkey 's sertab erener russia is the runaway favourite , simply because its entrants are none other than infamous chart-topping teenagers tatu , who promise scandal and surprise on the night .
but they 've plumped for a russian language song which is a disadvantage , and their ability to come up with the live goods on the night remains to be seen .
turkey 's entrant is experienced diva sertab erener , and her song is sultry , infectious and very sophisticated .
it may be too rich for some tastes , and the turks could be scuppered by eurovision 's infamous voting system .
bosnia-herzegovina usually has plenty of allies to throw votes its way , while its good entry is a disco thumper from mija martina , with the promise of scantily clad male dancers to lure eurovision 's key " pink " vote .

the electronics firm was given grants of £ 220 million to set up seven years ago , after promising to create more than 6,000 jobs .
but hopes for the plant were never realised , and it has been under threat since last september when a leaked company memo revealed that lg philips was considering closing its uk plants .
jenny randerson , the liberal democrats ' economic development spokesperson , is demanding an inquiry into why so much public money was given to the firm .
when lg announced in july 1996 that it was setting up a factory in newport - an unemployment black spot - it was hailed as the largest single inward investment ever seen in europe .
it promised to create 6,100 jobs , which would have a knock on effect on related industries .
then-prime minister john major proclaimed the south korean firm 's decision as a " vote of confidence " in the uk economy .
but the massive investment came at a cost as the hopes surrounding the plant were never realised .
the collapse of economies across asia in late 1997 and 1998 threatened dozens of far eastern electronics factories sited in wales and the uk .
and thursday 's announcement that 870 jobs were to be axed was blamed on a downturn in the market and increased competition .
now jenny randerson is calling for a full inquiry into the history of public funding to the company , which she said has received vast amounts of taxpayers ' money .
' flagship ' " the conservative government made this a flagship project , most of which did not get off the ground . " she said .
" now the newport plant will close because the company has failed to adapt and reinvest in newer technology .
" this was clearly a bad investment from day one .
" i want to know how much public money has been swallowed by this company . "
it 's the classic example of putting too may eggs in one basket " first minister rhodri morgan " can we recoup any of it and can we learn lessons for the future ? "
the welsh assembly 's first minister rhodri morgan said the government at the time pinned too many hopes on the plant . "
it 's the classic example of putting too may eggs in one basket , " he said .
" nobody could have foreseen the collapse of the korean economy , but we have struggled with this project ever since . "
but former secretary of state for wales , ron davies , told bbc radio wales said the decision to attract lg to south wales with public money was seen as the correct one at the time .
he said : " if you cast your mind back , everyone was jubilant in 1996 .
" there has -lrb- since -rrb- been an european inquiry which concluded that the investment was a proper investment .
" the great hope was not for the manufacturing plant , which has now shut , but for a semi-conductor plant which never materialised due to korean domestic politics . "
former chief economist with the welsh development agency , brian morgan , added : " the problem began with the failure to open the semi-conductor part of the business .
" when it did n't open , it was downhill from then on . "

the investigation announced by the mod on friday centres partly on an ongoing inquiry into the apparent suicide of an 18-year-old soldier in 2001 .
the colonel is also being investigated after allegations were made by an american officer about his treatment of iraqi civilians and prisoners of war .
the northern ireland-born colonel , who won wide praise for a rousing speech to his troops on the eve of the fighting , has been accused of breaking the rules of conduct during the conflict in iraq .
the mod stressed the two inquiries were unrelated and would be conducted separately .
commanding officer an inquiry was first launched into the 1st battalion of the royal irish regiment following the death of trooper paul cochrane at drumaad barracks , northern ireland , in 2001 .
colonel collins , 43 , was commanding officer of the regiment at the time .
the mod spokesman said : " we can confirm that a further internal investigation will be conducted to examine the military environment that existed within 1 royal irish during the period leading up to ranger cochrane 's death . "
colonel denies war claims colonel collins said he was confident of being cleared by the war conduct investigation , sparked by allegations made by an american officer .
colonel collins said he was astonished by the allegations and remained confident his " good name would be restored " .
the iraqi man at the centre of the allegations , ayoub yousif naser , told the times newspaper he was struck by the colonel and that he and his son were then made to face a wall .
he is reported to have said he heard the officer give the order to fire before he saw other troops approach with bandages to treat their wounds .
mr naser , who was a member of saddam hussein 's baath party , has not made any allegations against the colonel .
if found guilty of the allegations colonel collins could face disciplinary action or even expulsion from the army .
