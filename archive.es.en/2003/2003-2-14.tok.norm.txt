germans have been demonstrating for the cause of peace since long before a u.s.-led war began to loom over iraq .
kristian golla of bonn reflects on his two decades in the movement . bonn -lrb- dw -rrb- - it 's the thursday morning after colin powell made his closing arguments to the united nations security council - the multimedia presentation the u.s. secretary of state gave last week in an attempt to convince his allies of the need to unleash an american-led force against the dictatorship of saddam hussein .
kristian golla , a pacifist who has made a profession of promoting peace , is running a little behind schedule .
he pushes a handtruck piled high with empty yellow mail containers through the courtyard that leads to his office in the former german capital of bonn , an office he calls his " little shack . "
he parks the handtruck , turns on the lights and offers the visitor some butter cookies lying on a desk before he sits down to talk about his work , a calling that has carried him along the ebb and flow of the german peace movement over the last 22 years .
as the united states prepares for war in the persian gulf , golla 's immediate thoughts are on the closing arguments europeans plan to present at mass demonstrations in the continent 's asphalt-paved courtrooms on saturday .
" to justify a war based on that press conference , that just leaves me speechless , " golla says .
" that is simply nothing . "
the man in the movement the thoughts come quickly and the words flow smoothly as 40-year-old golla talks in the corner of his one-room office , its desks crammed with computers .
golla 's dark hair is streaked with gray , and it nearly stands at attention in some places on his head .
a thin silver ring pierces the lobe of his right ear .
a piece of masking tape sticks to the left side of his blue and white sweater - the place right over his heart .
" kristian , " it says in handwritten letters .
it is a name tag left over from a sunday meeting of one group planning the latest protests .
behind him , a poster proclaims its message of peace .
it shows a u.s. army howitzer whose barrel is covered with a condom .
" prevent wars , " the poster says in screaming orange capital letters .
dovish ideas are nothing new to golla ; they began circulating through his head many years before the gray began to spread its tentacles through his hair .
they form the basis of his working life .
" i find it personally very satisfying ... to cause -lrb- politicians -rrb- problems , to spit in their soup in order to get other issues on the agenda , " he says .
a game of nuclear poker the time of awakening for peace activists like golla was the late 1970s .
europe , with east germany and west germany in its center , was firmly in the middle of a nuclear poker game being played by the world 's two superpowers , the united states and soviet union .
as the game entered its third decade , the soviets decided to up the ante and deployed a new generation of mid-range nuclear missiles , the ss-20 .
the missiles posed a particular menace because they were mobile , carried three independently targetable warheads and could target all of western europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut schmidt the north atlantic treaty organization , with the support of west german chancellor helmut schmidt , decided to call the soviets ' bluff .
nato installed nuclear-capable cruise and pershing ii missiles to the alliance 's arsenal in west germany and other alliance members to counter the threat .
this vision of nuclear death helped spawn the west german peace movement , whose many followers knew all too well the devastation that german wars had caused .
the idea , as golla describes it , was to " stand in the way of this nuclear madness . "
but the more universal message was : " no more war . "
bonn became the focal point of protest and the city 's hofgarten often the journey 's end .
the hofgarten is a courtyard that stretches out like a green carpet the size of two football fields before the ocher-colored walls of the city 's university .
today , students can spend a sunday afternoon leisurely kicking around a soccer ball on the hofgarten 's wide open spaces .
but on oct .
10 , 1981 , there was hardly enough room to fit even one soccer ball - even an airless one - between the mass of demonstrators .
in all , an estimated 300,000 people converged on the hofgarten lawn to protest the alliance 's nuclear buildup .
it was the biggest political demonstration held in west germany since world war ii .
and true to its name , it went off peacefully .
an even bigger demonstration followed nine months later .
on a sunny june day , an estimated 350,000 protesters gathered near the rhine river to serve as a welcoming committee for u.s. president ronald reagan and the other nato leaders who were meeting on the opposite side .
it was an event filled with rock music , balloons and speeches - including one from gert bastian , the former west german general who had taken off his uniform to join the ranks of the armament opponents .
supporting the cause golla 's memories of the time remain vivid .
" when you are standing on the hofgarten , surrounded by all of these people , you know that you are doing your part for the cause , " he says .
looking back , he can also feel good about something else - the missiles eventually disappeared , buried in the collapse of the soviet bloc and the renunification of germany that followed in 1990 .
as the years passed , golla made a transition , too , turning from a demonstrator into a full-time activist for peace .
in 1988 , golla joined the staff of peace organization in bonn .
the mission of the group 's small office , which he jokingly acknowledges is staffed by 2.3 people , is simple : " a large part of our work is not to take to the streets ourselves in protest of something , but to get people to take to the streets . "

as war approached , germany 's peace movement roused itself from the slumber into which it had fallen with the end of the cold war .
in the days leading up to the gulf war , the green party 's joschka fischer , who is now foreign minister , stepped to the forefront , urging german troops bound for duty in turkey to refuse to serve .
thousands of other people followed , marching under the banner of " no blood for oil . "
at one protest , they temporarily blocked off the entrance to a u.s. air base that shares runways with the frankfurt international airport .
the war was taken so seriously by germans that many cities either cut back or called off winter carnival celebrations .
time for intensified protest once the air war against iraqi forces began on jan .
17 , golla and many others like him knew it was time to revive their hofgarten ritual .
golla 's days of protest in the early ' 80s had been carefree , but now he had new responsibilities as technical director of the huge event .
" i had to make sure everything was in place , " he recalls .
" by that i mean not only that the stage was set up and the speakers were there , but also that the complete setting was ready - the garbage bags , the signs for the bus parking lot and the special trains . "
but the protests did n't stop the u.s.-led coalition from going to war .
and after the battles ended and kuwait had been liberated , germany 's peace movement went back into hibernation , sleeping through the ethnic slaughter of bosnia and germany 's first military action since world war ii , the nato-led offensive against yugoslavia in 1999 .
during this conflict , it was foreign minister fischer 's turn to urge german soldiers to serve and to push a new rallying cry : " not another auschwitz . "

with a second u.s.-led war against iraq hanging on the horizon , the peace movement is wide awake .

this time on the part of singer konstantin wecker .
police are investigating the german celebrity to determine whether he incited a crime by issuing the call at a demonstration .

" today , we are not interested in rushing out onto the streets once the shooting has started .
it is too late then for the people who are being shot to death and killed , " he says .
" we are trying to stop it all from happening . "
as he directs his energy into the organization of saturday 's protests , he says he is guided by a principle shaped by more than two decades of work on behalf of non-violence .
" i know that i have achieved something and we have to keep up our activities , " he says .
" the person who does not do anything is the one who loses out . "

13-15 , 1945 .
with the publication of a new book , germans are re-examining the horror brought by allied planes during world war ii .
it is an issue that the city of dresden knows too well . the white postcard framed within a square of red bears a sign of death .
" city gone , " it says .
the message was written in the immediate aftermath of the allied firebombing of the baroque city of dresden , a series of air raids carried out from feb .
13-15 , 1945 .
today , it is one of the surviving documents that help people remember one of the war 's most controversial air attacks , directed at a city that had little military significance and served as sanctuary for thousands of refugees who had fled from the soviet red army .
as they do each year , the city 's residents held a series of services on thursday to mark the start of a three-day bombing attack that showered fire on the city .
it is not clear how many people died , partly because many victims were incinerated and their ashes mingled with the rubble .
the official estimate is 35,000 .
" you have to look at the fate of each individual so that afterward you do n't simply talk of collateral damage , " said jens herrmann at one of the thursday services .
to help keep the memory of those victims alive , the bells of all churches in the city began to toll at 9:45 p.m. , the time that the bombs began to fall .
anniversary gains new meaning this year 's services had special significance for two reasons .
hanging over thursday 's services was the growing threat of a new war .
even though this war would occur far from dresden , the city 's residents still expressed their dismay that this violence might kill more innocent people .
" we , the survivors of the bombing raids , appeal to the world : help prevent new suffering , new destruction and new death , " a declaration said .
this year 's anniversary also falls at a time when germans have begun to re-examine the horrors that the allied air war brought to their country .
the new debate was started with last years 's publication of a book called " the fire - germany and the bombardment 1940-1945 " by historian jörg friedrich .
" the bombardment of german towns and cities that went on for five years during world war ii has no parallel in history , " friedrich wrote .
" more than 1,000 cities and villages were bombed .
nearly a million tons of explosives were dropped on 30 million civilians - mostly women , children and the elderly . "
an estimated 635,000 civilians were killed and 130 german cities destroyed in the campaign .
book focuses on suffering but friedrich 's book goes beyond a recitation of numbers .
using such terms as " mass extermination , " " gassed , " and " crematoriums , " friedrich describes the suffering of the civilian population who were buried , burned and killed in the attacks with language more commonly used to describe the victims of german campaigns .
he also questions the strategy that led to this suffering .
" the british did indeed have the option in 1944-45 , a time when germany was already on its knees , of stopping the senseless carpet bombing campaign , " he said in a newspaper interview with the kölner stadt-anzeiger .
the book 's publication started a new examination around the country about the air war , its methods and its goals .
the war became the subjects of cover stories in national magazines .
" crimes against the germans ? " the magazine geo asked on its cover this month .
" the taboo subject - the air war . "
the war also was the subject of a documentary on public television last month that showed children eating their meals amid the ruins , elderly residents hobbling over piles of rubble and row after row of bodies lying on streets .
and germany 's leading opposition bloc in the german parliament is preparing to formally ask the coalition government how the country should mark the 60th anniversary of the raids around the country .
critics dislike book 's language friedrich 's book stands in the center of the debate .
it has also stood in the center of criticism - at home and abroad .
german critics , for one , have taken issue with friedrich 's choice of words .
in a review of the book that appeared in the süddeutsche zeitung , hans-ulrich wehler wrote : " there is talk of a ' war of annihilation ' being waged against the german cities and its residents , although this term was reserved for good reason in the past for the -lrb- nazi -rrb- war of annihilation waged against the jews and slavs . "
expressing a criticism coming from historians , wehler wrote : " the danger of friedrich 's book is that in its passion for the helpless victims of the allied bombing war it could further the cult of victimization that is so widespread in the united states . "
abroad , the book has upset britons .
these critics point out in particular that friedrich 's narrative is lopsided , ignoring the fact that nazi germany was the first to launch air raids on civilians in warsaw , poland ; rotterdam , the netherlands ; coventry , england ; and london .
thoughts of reconciliation in defense of his work , friedrich said he saw the book in a larger context .
" the culture of reconciliation has expanded to the point that we can now accept the truth , " he told the newspaper die welt .
in dresden , that culture of reconciliation has been at work for years .
one victim of the raids was a city landmark , the frauenkirche , the baroque church that for 200 years stood as a monument of the saxon capital 's glory .
the church is being rebuilt in an international effort .
among the thousands of people who have joined the effort are the british who are providing a golden cross for the new dome .
the cross was created by a london goldsmith with a special interest in dresden : his father was a pilot in the air raids . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de relief workers and disaster tourists converge on dresden dresden residents experienced a new form of destruction last august when floods poured into their city .

" you have to look at the fate of each individual so that afterward you do n't simply talk of collateral damage , " said jens herrmann at one of the thursday services .

hanging over thursday 's services was the growing threat of a new war .
even though this war would occur far from dresden , the city 's residents still expressed their dismay that this violence might kill more innocent people .
" we , the survivors of the bombing raids , appeal to the world : help prevent new suffering , new destruction and new death , " a declaration said .
this year 's anniversary also falls at a time when germans have begun to re-examine the horrors that the allied air war brought to their country .
the new debate was started with last years 's publication of a book called " the fire - germany and the bombardment 1940-1945 " by historian jörg friedrich .
" the bombardment of german towns and cities that went on for five years during world war ii has no parallel in history , " friedrich wrote .
" more than 1,000 cities and villages were bombed .
nearly a million tons of explosives were dropped on 30 million civilians - mostly women , children and the elderly . "
an estimated 635,000 civilians were killed and 130 german cities destroyed in the campaign .
book focuses on suffering but friedrich 's book goes beyond a recitation of numbers .
using such terms as " mass extermination , " " gassed , " and " crematoriums , " friedrich describes the suffering of the civilian population who were buried , burned and killed in the attacks with language more commonly used to describe the victims of german campaigns .
he also questions the strategy that led to this suffering .
" the british did indeed have the option in 1944-45 , a time when germany was already on its knees , of stopping the senseless carpet bombing campaign , " he said in a newspaper interview with the kölner stadt-anzeiger .
the book 's publication started a new examination around the country about the air war , its methods and its goals .
the war became the subjects of cover stories in national magazines .
" crimes against the germans ? " the magazine geo asked on its cover this month .
" the taboo subject - the air war . "
the war also was the subject of a documentary on public television last month that showed children eating their meals amid the ruins , elderly residents hobbling over piles of rubble and row after row of bodies lying on streets .
and germany 's leading opposition bloc in the german parliament is preparing to formally ask the coalition government how the country should mark the 60th anniversary of the raids around the country .
critics dislike book 's language friedrich 's book stands in the center of the debate .
it has also stood in the center of criticism - at home and abroad .
german critics , for one , have taken issue with friedrich 's choice of words .
in a review of the book that appeared in the süddeutsche zeitung , hans-ulrich wehler wrote : " there is talk of a ' war of annihilation ' being waged against the german cities and its residents , although this term was reserved for good reason in the past for the -lrb- nazi -rrb- war of annihilation waged against the jews and slavs . "
expressing a criticism coming from historians , wehler wrote : " the danger of friedrich 's book is that in its passion for the helpless victims of the allied bombing war it could further the cult of victimization that is so widespread in the united states . "
abroad , the book has upset britons .
these critics point out in particular that friedrich 's narrative is lopsided , ignoring the fact that nazi germany was the first to launch air raids on civilians in warsaw , poland ; rotterdam , the netherlands ; coventry , england ; and london .
thoughts of reconciliation in defense of his work , friedrich said he saw the book in a larger context .

mercedes sl roadsters in bremen .
as political tension between the united states and germany builds , german business leaders fear their bottom lines could suffer .
and they are planning an effort to curb losses . anton börner , the head of a leading german business group , has a three-word vision of horror running through his head as he watches the political ties between germany and the united states unravel .
it is : " do n't buy german . "
börner , president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , is one of many business leaders who are expressing fear that the political dispute could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a statement .
the fears extend to the cultural and political community as well .
and one organization , the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- , is taking out a full-page advertisement in sunday 's edition of the new york times and in monday 's edition of die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praises the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " the ad says .
schröder stakes out position the worries are being fueled by the clash between german chancellor gerhard schröder and president george w. bush over bush 's threat to wage war against iraqi leader saddam hussein .
schröder first began to anger u.s. officials during the summer , when he pledged on the campaign trail to keep german forces out of the possible war .
last month , he went even further , saying germany would not vote for any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized such an attack .
as börner and other trade group leaders have seen the tensions spread , the german domestic economy has slipped deeper into its slumber .
joblessness rose from 10.1 percent in december to 11.1 in january , creating a legion of 4.6 million people .
that is more than the population of the eastern state of saxony .
at the same time , exports have moved forward .
in 2002 , they climbed 1.6 percent to 648.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 695.6 billion -rrb- , according the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
but exports to the united states , germany 's biggest trading partner outside the european union , have grown stagnate as well .
through september , they dipped 3 percent , according to the federation of german industries .
a chill sets in as the political conflict boils , börner 's trade group said companies were reporting a chill in their relationship with customers .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " said andré schwarz , a spokesman for the foreign trade federation .

mercedes sl roadsters in bremen .
as political tension between the united states and germany builds , german business leaders fear their bottom lines could suffer .
and they are planning an effort to curb losses . anton börner , the head of a leading german business group , has a three-word vision of horror running through his head as he watches the political ties between germany and the united states unravel .
it is : " do n't buy german . "
börner , president of the federation of german wholesale and foreign trade , is one of many business leaders who are expressing fear that the political dispute could cause extensive damage to the country 's exports , the one area of the german economy that still is advancing .
" the excellent , decades-long relationship with the united states is a fundamental pillar of our prosperity , " börner said in a statement .
the fears extend to the cultural and political community as well .
and one organization , the atlantik brücke -lrb- atlantic bridge -rrb- , is taking out a full-page advertisement in sunday 's edition of the new york times and in monday 's edition of die welt to try to soothe raw feelings .
the ad by the group , germany 's oldest organization promoting u.s.-german ties , praises the two countries ' " community of values . "
" today , with the world being forced to defend itself against terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction , we reaffirm our alliance to the united states , " the ad says .
schröder stakes out position the worries are being fueled by the clash between german chancellor gerhard schröder and president george w. bush over bush 's threat to wage war against iraqi leader saddam hussein .
schröder first began to anger u.s. officials during the summer , when he pledged on the campaign trail to keep german forces out of the possible war .
last month , he went even further , saying germany would not vote for any resolution in the u.n. security council that authorized such an attack .
as börner and other trade group leaders have seen the tensions spread , the german domestic economy has slipped deeper into its slumber .
joblessness rose from 10.1 percent in december to 11.1 in january , creating a legion of 4.6 million people .
that is more than the population of the eastern state of saxony .
at the same time , exports have moved forward .
in 2002 , they climbed 1.6 percent to 648.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 695.6 billion -rrb- , according the german statistics office in wiesbaden .
but exports to the united states , germany 's biggest trading partner outside the european union , have grown stagnate as well .
through september , they dipped 3 percent , according to the federation of german industries .
a chill sets in as the political conflict boils , börner 's trade group said companies were reporting a chill in their relationship with customers .
" they are feeling an increased unease in their dealings with customers , " said andré schwarz , a spokesman for the foreign trade federation .
" and they are worried that the next step may be that people will look for alternatives . "
such large german international corporations as daimlerchrysler , bmw and siemens have not reported any problems yet , according to the reuters news agency .

figures for recent years released in a set of parliamentary answers show whitehall has not escaped the problem of computer misuse and " cyber slacking " .
revenue computer misuse discipline 2002 dismissed : 0 downgraded : 1 financial penalty : 2 reprimand : 199 source : treasury on the figures so far released the inland revenue , with its 70,000 staff , has suffered the most cases of misuse , but there has also been disciplinary action in other departments .
liberal democrat mp steve webb , who asked for the figures , suggested they confirmed fears about giving government officials too much access to information .
the trade union representing senior civil servants , however , says the number of cases is " fairly low " for the numbers involved .
tax staff government is hardly alone , however , with a recent survey suggesting cyber slackers were costing britain 's small businesses almost £ 1.5bn per year .
the computer misuse among taxmen has already prompted the inland revenue to warn its staff .
that warning came after it was found some employees were looking at celebrities ' tax returns .
last year , disciplinary action was taken in 205 cases , up from 56 in 1998 .
figures given in a parliamentary answer to conservative mp george osborne show three people were dismissed last year because of misuse at the inland revenue .
another person was " downgraded " , said treasury minister dawn primarolo , two paid financial penalties and another 199 received reprimands .
no staff were prosecuted , however .
professor webb said the figures he had so far received showed different levels of abuse for different departments .
" clearly there are some worrying trends , such as the fact that customs and excise have now investigated 101 cases this year and it was only one case three years ago , " he told bbc news online .
" either it was going on for a long time and no one has noticed , or there is a growing problem .
" one of the problems is that there is a tendency in government to pooh-pooh anyone who says we are not sure about giving officials access to information . "
the new figures suggested officials were not always as good as they should be , added prof webb .
strict e-mail rules customs and excise has more than 20,000 staff , most of whom have access to internal e-mail and external internet services .
disciplinary action was taken in 42 of the 101 cases investigated last year , according to treasury figures .
but a customs spokesman stressed that 83 of the cases investigated were about e-mail .
" regulations with regard to use of e-mail are fairly strict , " he said .
" for example , you can not send christmas cards . "
there were no serious infringements concerning personal data , he said .
six of the cases concerned it systems and four database access .
the customs spokesman stressed it was very difficult for staff to do any " celebrity browsing " of customs record , as they were not recorded by name , only by vat number .
there are fewer cases of misuse in other departments , which have fewer staff , but some of those appear to be more serious .
downloading porn culture minister kim howells said there had been 11 cases in his department in the last five years - all in 1999 .
two of the cases involved " accessing inappropriate material in the internet " - which saw one employee resign and one given a final written warning .
the other nine cases were over " inappropriate use of e-mail " , with one person instantly dismissed , five given verbal warnings and three receiving final written warnings .
at the foreign office , minister bill rammell said disciplinary action had been taken in five cases in the last five years .
one of those was for " downloading pornographic material " , mr rammell said in his written answer .
' fairly low ' another was due to offensive language being used in an e-mail and there were four cases of browsing " inappropriate internet sites " .
at the cabinet office , a total of 25 people have been disciplined for " inappropriate use of the internet " since 1998 - with only one case last year .
a spokesman for the first division association , which represents senior civil servants , said the number of cases were " fairly low given the number of employees involved " .

figures for recent years released in a set of parliamentary answers show whitehall has not escaped the problem of computer misuse and " cyber slacking " .
revenue computer misuse discipline 2002 dismissed : 0 downgraded : 1 financial penalty : 2 reprimand : 199 source : treasury on the figures so far released the inland revenue , with its 70,000 staff , has suffered the most cases of misuse , but there has also been disciplinary action in other departments .
liberal democrat mp steve webb , who asked for the figures , suggested they confirmed fears about giving government officials too much access to information .
the trade union representing senior civil servants , however , says the number of cases is " fairly low " for the numbers involved .
tax staff government is hardly alone , however , with a recent survey suggesting cyber slackers were costing britain 's small businesses almost £ 1.5bn per year .
the computer misuse among taxmen has already prompted the inland revenue to warn its staff .
that warning came after it was found some employees were looking at celebrities ' tax returns .
webb : figures show some worrying trends last year , disciplinary action was taken in 205 cases , up from 56 in 1998 .
figures given in a parliamentary answer to conservative mp george osborne show three people were dismissed last year because of misuse at the inland revenue .
another person was " downgraded " , said treasury minister dawn primarolo , two paid financial penalties and another 199 received reprimands .
no staff were prosecuted , however .
professor webb said the figures he had so far received showed different levels of abuse for different departments .
" clearly there are some worrying trends , such as the fact that customs and excise have now investigated 101 cases this year and it was only one case three years ago , " he told bbc news online .
" either it was going on for a long time and no one has noticed , or there is a growing problem .
" one of the problems is that there is a tendency in government to pooh-pooh anyone who says we are not sure about giving officials access to information . "
the new figures suggested officials were not always as good as they should be , added prof webb .
strict e-mail rules customs and excise has more than 20,000 staff , most of whom have access to internal e-mail and external internet services .
disciplinary action was taken in 42 of the 101 cases investigated last year , according to treasury figures .
but a customs spokesman stressed that 83 of the cases investigated were about e-mail .
whitehall has not proved immune to computer abuse problems " regulations with regard to use of e-mail are fairly strict , " he said .
" for example , you can not send christmas cards . "
there were no serious infringements concerning personal data , he said .
six of the cases concerned it systems and four database access .
the customs spokesman stressed it was very difficult for staff to do any " celebrity browsing " of customs record , as they were not recorded by name , only by vat number .
there are fewer cases of misuse in other departments , which have fewer staff , but some of those appear to be more serious .
downloading porn culture minister kim howells said there had been 11 cases in his department in the last five years - all in 1999 .
two of the cases involved " accessing inappropriate material in the internet " - which saw one employee resign and one given a final written warning .
the other nine cases were over " inappropriate use of e-mail " , with one person instantly dismissed , five given verbal warnings and three receiving final written warnings .
at the foreign office , minister bill rammell said disciplinary action had been taken in five cases in the last five years .
one of those was for " downloading pornographic material " , mr rammell said in his written answer .
' fairly low ' another was due to offensive language being used in an e-mail and there were four cases of browsing " inappropriate internet sites " .
at the cabinet office , a total of 25 people have been disciplined for " inappropriate use of the internet " since 1998 - with only one case last year .
a spokesman for the first division association , which represents senior civil servants , said the number of cases were " fairly low given the number of employees involved " .
the association was working with all departments to develop reasonable policies on internet and email use , he said .
transparency was the priority " so staff know what is and is not considered acceptable practice " .
