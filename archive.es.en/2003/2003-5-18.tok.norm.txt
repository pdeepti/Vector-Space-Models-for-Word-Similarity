in a two-day referendum , a majority of slovaks voted to join the european union .
the country 's leading parties breathed a collective sigh of relief that enough voters turned out . slovakia 's voters have decided to join the european union .
the central election commission in bratislava announced on sunday that 92.46 percent of votes cast in the referendum were in favor of joining the eu .
the officials said 52.12 percent of those registered voted , slightly more than the 50 percent necessary for the referendum , which took place on friday and saturday , to be valid according to the slovak constitution . " the referendum is valid , and an overwhelming majority of our citizens said ' yes ' for slovakia to enter the eu .
good luck to you all in the eu , " prime minister mikulas dzurinda said in an address to the nation on saturday evening . the european commission welcomed the result , congratulating slovakia for " the overwhelming support for eu accession . "
" this demonstrates the strong will of the slovak people to join the european family of democratic nations as a member of the euorpean union , with equal rights and obligations , " it said in a statement . sluggish turnout opinion polls had shown that around 80 percent of slovaks wanted to accede to the eu , but people were sluggish about casting their votes .
by noon on saturday just 48 percent of the 4.2 million registered voters had been to the polls .
the day before , only 25 to 30 percent had voted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak president rudolf schuster , -lrb- center -rrb- , slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda -lrb- right -rrb- and speaker of parliament pavol hrusovsky shortly before polling stations closed at 2:00 p.m. on saturday , slovak radio and television broadcast a joint statement from president rudolf schuster -lrb- photo , center -rrb- and parliament speaker pavol hrusovsky -lrb- photo , left -rrb- appealing to their countrymen and women to vote . " we were sweating it out a bit in the morning and afternoon because it looked touch and go , but at the end of the day , it turned out fine , " european commission ambassador to slovakia eric van der linden told reuters . analysts attributed the low turnout to several factors .
they said that voters were expressing disillusionment with prime minister dzurinda 's center-right government , which had implemented harsh reforms that allowed the country to shake off the political and economic isolation it had been subjected to under the autocratic leadership of prime minister vladimir meciar in the mid-1990s . observers criticized the government 's promotional campaign in favor of joining the eu too , saying it had failed to explain what eu membership would mean for ordinary slovaks .
the government also reaped criticism for not publicizing information on the referendum in the language of the roma minority . even if the referendum had failed to attract 50 percent of the country 's voters , parliament could still have decided to join the eu .
but it would have been an embarrassment for both slovakia and for the european commission .
all of slovakia 's leading political parties support eu membership . slovakia is the fifth country to vote to join the eu in the group of nine candidate countries scheduled to accede to the union in may 2004 .

the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels on thursday and friday to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .
there ’ s been heated debate about who will wield power in the future eu . a two-day meeting over a draft constitution for the future european union has been marked by clashes between bigger nations and smaller ones over who will hold the real reins of power as the eu expands into eastern europe next may . the delegates of the convention for the future of europe , who gathered in brussels at the end of this week , are racing against time to broker a compromise for the document that will be the legal underpinning of a new 25-member european union .
the draft is to be presented to eu leaders at a summit on june 20-21 . the constitution is designed to simplify the way the eu works in advance of its biggest ever expansion .
many of the rules governing the union were originally created for the six founding members of the european economic community in 1957 . some of the 105 delegates saw the meeting in brussels as a david and goliath story writ large .
smaller states like the benelux countries and austria accused giants like germany and france of riding roughshod over their concerns in supporting a controversial future framework that smaller members feel would cement power in the hands of the “ big five ” — france , britain , spain , germany and italy — and relegate the small countries to the sidelines . big vs. small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi during a press conference at the zappeion hall in athens , wednesday , april 16 , 2003 .
ten nations will sign treaties to join the european union on wednesday , including eight former communist countries cut off from their western neighbors until little more than a decade ago .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the main contention has centered around a suggestion put forward by valéry giscard d ’ estaing , former french president and head of the eu convention -lrb- photo , right , with romano prodi -rrb- , to appoint a long-term president to the european council , the eu ’ s main decision-making body . giscard d ’ estaing has said such sweeping reform of the system is necessary if the bloc , which expands from 15 to 25 member states next year , wants to avoid decision-making paralysis .
he says a president appointed from the ranks of former national leaders for terms of up to five years would give the eu continuity , instead of the current “ musical chairs ” system in which the council presidency rotates among member states every six months . but smaller states suspect that such a redesigned presidency would be dominated by the big states .
since the council president chairs eu summits and helps set the bloc ’ s strategic course , smaller nations fear the new structure would cement larger members ’ hold on power .
they also fear the giscard d ’ estaing plan would weaken the role of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies . “ so far 101 members of the convention have presented a petition against the long-term council president , 15 governments , ” said austrian delegate johannes voggenhuber .

he said privately almost all of the smaller countries had told him they accepted that they had to “ do a deal ” on the presidency . he and german foreign minister joschka fischer suggested that a plan to strengthen the european commission might help seal an accord with the small states .

in a two-day referendum , a majority of slovaks voted to join the european union .
the country 's leading parties breathed a collective sigh of relief that enough voters turned out . slovakia 's voters have decided to join the european union .
the central election commission in bratislava announced on sunday that 92.46 percent of votes cast in the referendum were in favor of joining the eu .
the officials said 52.12 percent of those registered voted , slightly more than the 50 percent necessary for the referendum , which took place on friday and saturday , to be valid according to the slovak constitution . " the referendum is valid , and an overwhelming majority of our citizens said ' yes ' for slovakia to enter the eu .
good luck to you all in the eu , " prime minister mikulas dzurinda said in an address to the nation on saturday evening . the european commission welcomed the result , congratulating slovakia for " the overwhelming support for eu accession . "
" this demonstrates the strong will of the slovak people to join the european family of democratic nations as a member of the euorpean union , with equal rights and obligations , " it said in a statement . sluggish turnout opinion polls had shown that around 80 percent of slovaks wanted to accede to the eu , but people were sluggish about casting their votes .
by noon on saturday just 48 percent of the 4.2 million registered voters had been to the polls .
the day before , only 25 to 30 percent had voted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak president rudolf schuster , -lrb- center -rrb- , slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda -lrb- right -rrb- and speaker of parliament pavol hrusovsky shortly before polling stations closed at 2:00 p.m. on saturday , slovak radio and television broadcast a joint statement from president rudolf schuster -lrb- photo , center -rrb- and parliament speaker pavol hrusovsky -lrb- photo , left -rrb- appealing to their countrymen and women to vote . " we were sweating it out a bit in the morning and afternoon because it looked touch and go , but at the end of the day , it turned out fine , " european commission ambassador to slovakia eric van der linden told reuters . analysts attributed the low turnout to several factors .
they said that voters were expressing disillusionment with prime minister dzurinda 's center-right government , which had implemented harsh reforms that allowed the country to shake off the political and economic isolation it had been subjected to under the autocratic leadership of prime minister vladimir meciar in the mid-1990s . observers criticized the government 's promotional campaign in favor of joining the eu too , saying it had failed to explain what eu membership would mean for ordinary slovaks .
the government also reaped criticism for not publicizing information on the referendum in the language of the roma minority . even if the referendum had failed to attract 50 percent of the country 's voters , parliament could still have decided to join the eu .
but it would have been an embarrassment for both slovakia and for the european commission .

the officials said 52.12 percent of those registered voted , slightly more than the 50 percent necessary for the referendum , which took place on friday and saturday , to be valid according to the slovak constitution . " the referendum is valid , and an overwhelming majority of our citizens said ' yes ' for slovakia to enter the eu .
good luck to you all in the eu , " prime minister mikulas dzurinda said in an address to the nation on saturday evening . the european commission welcomed the result , congratulating slovakia for " the overwhelming support for eu accession . "
" this demonstrates the strong will of the slovak people to join the european family of democratic nations as a member of the euorpean union , with equal rights and obligations , " it said in a statement . sluggish turnout opinion polls had shown that around 80 percent of slovaks wanted to accede to the eu , but people were sluggish about casting their votes .
by noon on saturday just 48 percent of the 4.2 million registered voters had been to the polls .
the day before , only 25 to 30 percent had voted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak president rudolf schuster , -lrb- center -rrb- , slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda -lrb- right -rrb- and speaker of parliament pavol hrusovsky shortly before polling stations closed at 2:00 p.m. on saturday , slovak radio and television broadcast a joint statement from president rudolf schuster -lrb- photo , center -rrb- and parliament speaker pavol hrusovsky -lrb- photo , left -rrb- appealing to their countrymen and women to vote . " we were sweating it out a bit in the morning and afternoon because it looked touch and go , but at the end of the day , it turned out fine , " european commission ambassador to slovakia eric van der linden told reuters . analysts attributed the low turnout to several factors .
they said that voters were expressing disillusionment with prime minister dzurinda 's center-right government , which had implemented harsh reforms that allowed the country to shake off the political and economic isolation it had been subjected to under the autocratic leadership of prime minister vladimir meciar in the mid-1990s . observers criticized the government 's promotional campaign in favor of joining the eu too , saying it had failed to explain what eu membership would mean for ordinary slovaks .
the government also reaped criticism for not publicizing information on the referendum in the language of the roma minority . even if the referendum had failed to attract 50 percent of the country 's voters , parliament could still have decided to join the eu .

the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels on thursday and friday to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .
there ’ s been heated debate about who will wield power in the future eu . a two-day meeting over a draft constitution for the future european union has been marked by clashes between bigger nations and smaller ones over who will hold the real reins of power as the eu expands into eastern europe next may . the delegates of the convention for the future of europe , who gathered in brussels at the end of this week , are racing against time to broker a compromise for the document that will be the legal underpinning of a new 25-member european union .
the draft is to be presented to eu leaders at a summit on june 20-21 . the constitution is designed to simplify the way the eu works in advance of its biggest ever expansion .
many of the rules governing the union were originally created for the six founding members of the european economic community in 1957 . some of the 105 delegates saw the meeting in brussels as a david and goliath story writ large .
smaller states like the benelux countries and austria accused giants like germany and france of riding roughshod over their concerns in supporting a controversial future framework that smaller members feel would cement power in the hands of the “ big five ” — france , britain , spain , germany and italy — and relegate the small countries to the sidelines . big vs. small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi during a press conference at the zappeion hall in athens , wednesday , april 16 , 2003 .
ten nations will sign treaties to join the european union on wednesday , including eight former communist countries cut off from their western neighbors until little more than a decade ago .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the main contention has centered around a suggestion put forward by valéry giscard d ’ estaing , former french president and head of the eu convention -lrb- photo , right , with romano prodi -rrb- , to appoint a long-term president to the european council , the eu ’ s main decision-making body . giscard d ’ estaing has said such sweeping reform of the system is necessary if the bloc , which expands from 15 to 25 member states next year , wants to avoid decision-making paralysis .
he says a president appointed from the ranks of former national leaders for terms of up to five years would give the eu continuity , instead of the current “ musical chairs ” system in which the council presidency rotates among member states every six months . but smaller states suspect that such a redesigned presidency would be dominated by the big states .
since the council president chairs eu summits and helps set the bloc ’ s strategic course , smaller nations fear the new structure would cement larger members ’ hold on power .
they also fear the giscard d ’ estaing plan would weaken the role of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies . “ so far 101 members of the convention have presented a petition against the long-term council president , 15 governments , ” said austrian delegate johannes voggenhuber .

i know there is a deal there to be done , ” peter hain , the british government representative told reuters .
he said privately almost all of the smaller countries had told him they accepted that they had to “ do a deal ” on the presidency . he and german foreign minister joschka fischer suggested that a plan to strengthen the european commission might help seal an accord with the small states .
the idea would streamline the eu executive and have its president elected by the european parliament . “ we ’ re not far from something we all can agree on , ” fischer said . an eu foreign minister ? on friday , delegates backed a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile and to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .

he won high praise and international recognition for his skillful mediation between israel and the palestinians . fischer , however , is playing down any suggestions that he will be moving to brussels , saying he is happy being germany ’ s top diplomat . a long last spurt to ratification while the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at the summit in greece in july , diplomats have said only the first part of the draft constitution may be ready by then . greece ’ s foreign minister , george papandreou , has said that suggestions to extend the convention past the july deadline in order to give delegates more time to work out controversial points is a “ logical proposal . ” after the draft is completed , eu governments will then have until spring to thrash out differences .

the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels on thursday and friday to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .
there ’ s been heated debate about who will wield power in the future eu . a two-day meeting over a draft constitution for the future european union has been marked by clashes between bigger nations and smaller ones over who will hold the real reins of power as the eu expands into eastern europe next may . the delegates of the convention for the future of europe , who gathered in brussels at the end of this week , are racing against time to broker a compromise for the document that will be the legal underpinning of a new 25-member european union .
the draft is to be presented to eu leaders at a summit on june 20-21 . the constitution is designed to simplify the way the eu works in advance of its biggest ever expansion .
many of the rules governing the union were originally created for the six founding members of the european economic community in 1957 . some of the 105 delegates saw the meeting in brussels as a david and goliath story writ large .
smaller states like the benelux countries and austria accused giants like germany and france of riding roughshod over their concerns in supporting a controversial future framework that smaller members feel would cement power in the hands of the “ big five ” — france , britain , spain , germany and italy — and relegate the small countries to the sidelines . big vs. small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi during a press conference at the zappeion hall in athens , wednesday , april 16 , 2003 .
ten nations will sign treaties to join the european union on wednesday , including eight former communist countries cut off from their western neighbors until little more than a decade ago .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the main contention has centered around a suggestion put forward by valéry giscard d ’ estaing , former french president and head of the eu convention -lrb- photo , right , with romano prodi -rrb- , to appoint a long-term president to the european council , the eu ’ s main decision-making body . giscard d ’ estaing has said such sweeping reform of the system is necessary if the bloc , which expands from 15 to 25 member states next year , wants to avoid decision-making paralysis .
he says a president appointed from the ranks of former national leaders for terms of up to five years would give the eu continuity , instead of the current “ musical chairs ” system in which the council presidency rotates among member states every six months . but smaller states suspect that such a redesigned presidency would be dominated by the big states .
since the council president chairs eu summits and helps set the bloc ’ s strategic course , smaller nations fear the new structure would cement larger members ’ hold on power .
they also fear the giscard d ’ estaing plan would weaken the role of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies . “ so far 101 members of the convention have presented a petition against the long-term council president , 15 governments , ” said austrian delegate johannes voggenhuber .
“ isn ’ t that enough , or are we going to have to labor over this plan , which enjoys no majority and never will have a consensus , for weeks . ” deal in the works ? despite the strong differences of opinion expressed over the past two days , delegates from britain and germany have said they see the outlines of a compromise deal between the two positions emerging . “ there is a big contrast between the negotiating poses struck in public and what i know to be the case in private .
i know there is a deal there to be done , ” peter hain , the british government representative told reuters .
he said privately almost all of the smaller countries had told him they accepted that they had to “ do a deal ” on the presidency . he and german foreign minister joschka fischer suggested that a plan to strengthen the european commission might help seal an accord with the small states .
the idea would streamline the eu executive and have its president elected by the european parliament . “ we ’ re not far from something we all can agree on , ” fischer said . an eu foreign minister ? on friday , delegates backed a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile and to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commission for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer on the way to the cabinet meeting in berlin chancellery wednesday , july 10 , 2002 .

what began as a union of equals in may 1993 , quickly developed a western german focus . double names are one of those things .
on the one hand , they 're supposed to show that spouses remain independent after the wedding .
on the other , they 're often hard to understand , and sooner or later one of the names is often dropped for the sake of simplicity . the case is no different in politics . ten years ago , the eastern german grassroots movement alliance 90 merged with the green party from western germany , but nowadays there 's only talk of the greens .
that 's because there 's not much left of alliance 90 in the small governing coalition party , which says it has 45,000 members , only 6,000 of which are in eastern germany and berlin . during celebrations of the fusion in leipzig on saturday the party announced that it 's " time to flourish . "
the evening was marked by optimism about the party 's future , and the focus was on improving election results in eastern german states . party head reinhard bütikofer looked forward to the party polling double-digit results in eastern german saxony - in 10 years . a decade since the fusion , the greens have become a predominantly western german , urban party , that is n't particularly well received in the eastern german states . union of equals on may 17 , 1993 , however , heiko weigel , the then-head of the alliance in eastern german saxony announced the successful fusion at a party convention in leipzig .
" from here on , it 's just alliance 90 / the greens and just jointly , " he proclaimed . at the time , the eastern greens were on top of things , the only representatives of the party in parliament .
the western party had ignored german unification in 1990 , instead making climate protection their main campaign issue in federal parliamentary elections and consequently loosing their mandates .
the eastern greens , however , reached the five percent hurdle necessary to sit in parliament . there were fears that alliance 90 , with around 5,600 members , would be swallowed up by the roughly 34,000 greens .
they were different from their friends from the west : less dogmatic , willing to enter into coalitions with the conservatives .
their main issues were rebuilding eastern germany , democracy and coming to terms with east germany 's communist past , much less so environmental protection . then a state minister in western german hesse , joschka fischer - today the unofficial head of the greens and germany 's foreign minister - commented 10 years ago , " the time when we were essentially a protest party - as important as it was - this time finally came to an end for the greens / alliance 90 with german unification . " as a joint party alliance 90 / the greens was in parliament for the first time in 1994 .
since 1998 they have been part of the ruling governmental coalition along with the social democratic party . but the party still does n't do well in eastern germany .
the urban , intellectual , student setting that made the western greens strong does n't exist there . the grassroots movement 's topics too have become consistently less important in the interval since the turbulent days of unification .

the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels on thursday and friday to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .
there ’ s been heated debate about who will wield power in the future eu . a two-day meeting over a draft constitution for the future european union has been marked by clashes between bigger nations and smaller ones over who will hold the real reins of power as the eu expands into eastern europe next may . the delegates of the convention for the future of europe , who gathered in brussels at the end of this week , are racing against time to broker a compromise for the document that will be the legal underpinning of a new 25-member european union .
the draft is to be presented to eu leaders at a summit on june 20-21 . the constitution is designed to simplify the way the eu works in advance of its biggest ever expansion .
many of the rules governing the union were originally created for the six founding members of the european economic community in 1957 . some of the 105 delegates saw the meeting in brussels as a david and goliath story writ large .
smaller states like the benelux countries and austria accused giants like germany and france of riding roughshod over their concerns in supporting a controversial future framework that smaller members feel would cement power in the hands of the “ big five ” — france , britain , spain , germany and italy — and relegate the small countries to the sidelines . big vs. small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi during a press conference at the zappeion hall in athens , wednesday , april 16 , 2003 .
ten nations will sign treaties to join the european union on wednesday , including eight former communist countries cut off from their western neighbors until little more than a decade ago .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the main contention has centered around a suggestion put forward by valéry giscard d ’ estaing , former french president and head of the eu convention -lrb- photo , right , with romano prodi -rrb- , to appoint a long-term president to the european council , the eu ’ s main decision-making body . giscard d ’ estaing has said such sweeping reform of the system is necessary if the bloc , which expands from 15 to 25 member states next year , wants to avoid decision-making paralysis .
he says a president appointed from the ranks of former national leaders for terms of up to five years would give the eu continuity , instead of the current “ musical chairs ” system in which the council presidency rotates among member states every six months . but smaller states suspect that such a redesigned presidency would be dominated by the big states .
since the council president chairs eu summits and helps set the bloc ’ s strategic course , smaller nations fear the new structure would cement larger members ’ hold on power .
they also fear the giscard d ’ estaing plan would weaken the role of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies . “ so far 101 members of the convention have presented a petition against the long-term council president , 15 governments , ” said austrian delegate johannes voggenhuber .
“ isn ’ t that enough , or are we going to have to labor over this plan , which enjoys no majority and never will have a consensus , for weeks . ” deal in the works ? despite the strong differences of opinion expressed over the past two days , delegates from britain and germany have said they see the outlines of a compromise deal between the two positions emerging . “ there is a big contrast between the negotiating poses struck in public and what i know to be the case in private .
i know there is a deal there to be done , ” peter hain , the british government representative told reuters .
he said privately almost all of the smaller countries had told him they accepted that they had to “ do a deal ” on the presidency . he and german foreign minister joschka fischer suggested that a plan to strengthen the european commission might help seal an accord with the small states .
the idea would streamline the eu executive and have its president elected by the european parliament . “ we ’ re not far from something we all can agree on , ” fischer said . an eu foreign minister ? on friday , delegates backed a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile and to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commission for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer on the way to the cabinet meeting in berlin chancellery wednesday , july 10 , 2002 .
fischer leads the meeting due to chancellor gerhard schroeder 's vacations .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- france has thrown its support behind germany ’ s top diplomat joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- as a candidate for the likely new post .
fischer ’ s boss , german chancellor gerhard schröder and luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker have also spoken out in his favor . the 55-year-old fischer is leader of the green party in germany and has been the country ’ s foreign minister and vice-chancellor since 1998 .
he won high praise and international recognition for his skillful mediation between israel and the palestinians . fischer , however , is playing down any suggestions that he will be moving to brussels , saying he is happy being germany ’ s top diplomat . a long last spurt to ratification while the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at the summit in greece in july , diplomats have said only the first part of the draft constitution may be ready by then . greece ’ s foreign minister , george papandreou , has said that suggestions to extend the convention past the july deadline in order to give delegates more time to work out controversial points is a “ logical proposal . ” after the draft is completed , eu governments will then have until spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .
that is not expected until 2006 at the earliest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fischer touted for top eu foreign policy job german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister .
france , germany defend joint eu constitution proposal germany and france 's foreign ministers sought to build support for their eu constitution proposal on tuesday , but faced stiff resistance from members of the constitutional convention .
reactions mixed to draft eu constitution former french president valery giscard d 'estaing unveiled the first draft of a new european constitution on monday that could lead to a " united europe " with an elected president and increased federalism .

the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels on thursday and friday to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .
there ’ s been heated debate about who will wield power in the future eu . a two-day meeting over a draft constitution for the future european union has been marked by clashes between bigger nations and smaller ones over who will hold the real reins of power as the eu expands into eastern europe next may . the delegates of the convention for the future of europe , who gathered in brussels at the end of this week , are racing against time to broker a compromise for the document that will be the legal underpinning of a new 25-member european union .
the draft is to be presented to eu leaders at a summit on june 20-21 . the constitution is designed to simplify the way the eu works in advance of its biggest ever expansion .
many of the rules governing the union were originally created for the six founding members of the european economic community in 1957 . some of the 105 delegates saw the meeting in brussels as a david and goliath story writ large .
smaller states like the benelux countries and austria accused giants like germany and france of riding roughshod over their concerns in supporting a controversial future framework that smaller members feel would cement power in the hands of the “ big five ” — france , britain , spain , germany and italy — and relegate the small countries to the sidelines . big vs. small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi during a press conference at the zappeion hall in athens , wednesday , april 16 , 2003 .
ten nations will sign treaties to join the european union on wednesday , including eight former communist countries cut off from their western neighbors until little more than a decade ago .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the main contention has centered around a suggestion put forward by valéry giscard d ’ estaing , former french president and head of the eu convention -lrb- photo , right , with romano prodi -rrb- , to appoint a long-term president to the european council , the eu ’ s main decision-making body . giscard d ’ estaing has said such sweeping reform of the system is necessary if the bloc , which expands from 15 to 25 member states next year , wants to avoid decision-making paralysis .
he says a president appointed from the ranks of former national leaders for terms of up to five years would give the eu continuity , instead of the current “ musical chairs ” system in which the council presidency rotates among member states every six months . but smaller states suspect that such a redesigned presidency would be dominated by the big states .
since the council president chairs eu summits and helps set the bloc ’ s strategic course , smaller nations fear the new structure would cement larger members ’ hold on power .
they also fear the giscard d ’ estaing plan would weaken the role of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies . “ so far 101 members of the convention have presented a petition against the long-term council president , 15 governments , ” said austrian delegate johannes voggenhuber .

he said privately almost all of the smaller countries had told him they accepted that they had to “ do a deal ” on the presidency . he and german foreign minister joschka fischer suggested that a plan to strengthen the european commission might help seal an accord with the small states .

what began as a union of equals in may 1993 , quickly developed a western german focus . double names are one of those things .
on the one hand , they 're supposed to show that spouses remain independent after the wedding .
on the other , they 're often hard to understand , and sooner or later one of the names is often dropped for the sake of simplicity . the case is no different in politics . ten years ago , the eastern german grassroots movement alliance 90 merged with the green party from western germany , but nowadays there 's only talk of the greens .
that 's because there 's not much left of alliance 90 in the small governing coalition party , which says it has 45,000 members , only 6,000 of which are in eastern germany and berlin . during celebrations of the fusion in leipzig on saturday the party announced that it 's " time to flourish . "
the evening was marked by optimism about the party 's future , and the focus was on improving election results in eastern german states . party head reinhard bütikofer looked forward to the party polling double-digit results in eastern german saxony - in 10 years . a decade since the fusion , the greens have become a predominantly western german , urban party , that is n't particularly well received in the eastern german states . union of equals on may 17 , 1993 , however , heiko weigel , the then-head of the alliance in eastern german saxony announced the successful fusion at a party convention in leipzig .

since 1998 they have been part of the ruling governmental coalition along with the social democratic party . but the party still does n't do well in eastern germany .
the urban , intellectual , student setting that made the western greens strong does n't exist there . the grassroots movement 's topics too have become consistently less important in the interval since the turbulent days of unification .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 18.05.2003 slovakia votes to join european union großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the country 's president made a desperate appeal to slovaks to vote just hours before polling stations closed .
in a two-day referendum , a majority of slovaks voted to join the european union .
the country 's leading parties breathed a collective sigh of relief that enough voters turned out . slovakia 's voters have decided to join the european union .
the central election commission in bratislava announced on sunday that 92.46 percent of votes cast in the referendum were in favor of joining the eu .
the officials said 52.12 percent of those registered voted , slightly more than the 50 percent necessary for the referendum , which took place on friday and saturday , to be valid according to the slovak constitution . " the referendum is valid , and an overwhelming majority of our citizens said ' yes ' for slovakia to enter the eu .
good luck to you all in the eu , " prime minister mikulas dzurinda said in an address to the nation on saturday evening . the european commission welcomed the result , congratulating slovakia for " the overwhelming support for eu accession . "

police suspect moroccan islamists . some of the thirteen suicide bombers who killed 28 people and injuring around 100 in attacks in casablanca on friday may have had links to a local radical islamist group , moroccan justice minister mohamed bouzoubaa said on sunday .
the assassins came from abroad , though they were moroccan citizens , bouzoubaa reportedly told the state television channel rtm . a fourteenth assailant , who had been injured in the bombings , was being held in police custody on sunday . " he gave information on his criminal accomplices and helped identify those who were involved in the operation , the justice minister said , adding that the authorities believe that a little-known islamist group called assirat al moustaquim may have carried out the attacks . moroccan police questioned 33 suspects on saturday . the four car bombs and explosives strapped to an assassin 's body went off at around 10:00 p.m. local time -lrb- 2200 gmt -rrb- in the center of morocco 's biggest city . at least one suicide bomber detonated explosives attached to his body in a spanish restaurant .
a spanish cultural center , a jewish community center and cemetery , the belgian consulate and a luxury hotel were damaged in the blasts in the restaurant and by the four car bombs . mainly moroccans killed although the targets were mainly western , the victims were mostly moroccan .
seven foreigners were killed in the attacks , three spaniards , three french nationals and an italian . two policemen guarding the belgian consulate were also killed and a security guard was injured in the blast there , which damaged the building badly . moroccan journalist aboubakr jamai told the bbc on saturday that the targets had likely been chosen because they were not heavily guarded , contrary to american sites in the country . al qaeda suspected no group claimed responsibility for the bombings , which were the first terrorist attacks to take place in morocco in recent years . initially the moroccan authorities suspected the al qaeda terror network - which is considered responsible for the terrorist attacks in new york and washington on sept .
11 , 2001 - of carrying out the bombings . experts believe the group was also responsible for the attacks several days ago in saudi arabia 's capital riyadh , where 34 people were killed in a neighborhood mainly inhabited by western foreigners .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 18.05.2003 the labor pains of an eu constitution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : compromising on a constitution in brussels .
the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels on thursday and friday to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .
there ’ s been heated debate about who will wield power in the future eu . a two-day meeting over a draft constitution for the future european union has been marked by clashes between bigger nations and smaller ones over who will hold the real reins of power as the eu expands into eastern europe next may . the delegates of the convention for the future of europe , who gathered in brussels at the end of this week , are racing against time to broker a compromise for the document that will be the legal underpinning of a new 25-member european union .
the draft is to be presented to eu leaders at a summit on june 20-21 . the constitution is designed to simplify the way the eu works in advance of its biggest ever expansion .
many of the rules governing the union were originally created for the six founding members of the european economic community in 1957 . some of the 105 delegates saw the meeting in brussels as a david and goliath story writ large .
smaller states like the benelux countries and austria accused giants like germany and france of riding roughshod over their concerns in supporting a controversial future framework that smaller members feel would cement power in the hands of the “ big five ” — france , britain , spain , germany and italy — and relegate the small countries to the sidelines . big vs. small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi during a press conference at the zappeion hall in athens , wednesday , april 16 , 2003 .
ten nations will sign treaties to join the european union on wednesday , including eight former communist countries cut off from their western neighbors until little more than a decade ago .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the main contention has centered around a suggestion put forward by valéry giscard d ’ estaing , former french president and head of the eu convention -lrb- photo , right , with romano prodi -rrb- , to appoint a long-term president to the european council , the eu ’ s main decision-making body . giscard d ’ estaing has said such sweeping reform of the system is necessary if the bloc , which expands from 15 to 25 member states next year , wants to avoid decision-making paralysis .
he says a president appointed from the ranks of former national leaders for terms of up to five years would give the eu continuity , instead of the current “ musical chairs ” system in which the council presidency rotates among member states every six months . but smaller states suspect that such a redesigned presidency would be dominated by the big states .
since the council president chairs eu summits and helps set the bloc ’ s strategic course , smaller nations fear the new structure would cement larger members ’ hold on power .
they also fear the giscard d ’ estaing plan would weaken the role of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies . “ so far 101 members of the convention have presented a petition against the long-term council president , 15 governments , ” said austrian delegate johannes voggenhuber .
“ isn ’ t that enough , or are we going to have to labor over this plan , which enjoys no majority and never will have a consensus , for weeks . ” deal in the works ? despite the strong differences of opinion expressed over the past two days , delegates from britain and germany have said they see the outlines of a compromise deal between the two positions emerging . “ there is a big contrast between the negotiating poses struck in public and what i know to be the case in private .
i know there is a deal there to be done , ” peter hain , the british government representative told reuters .
he said privately almost all of the smaller countries had told him they accepted that they had to “ do a deal ” on the presidency . he and german foreign minister joschka fischer suggested that a plan to strengthen the european commission might help seal an accord with the small states .
the idea would streamline the eu executive and have its president elected by the european parliament . “ we ’ re not far from something we all can agree on , ” fischer said . an eu foreign minister ? on friday , delegates backed a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile and to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commission for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer on the way to the cabinet meeting in berlin chancellery wednesday , july 10 , 2002 .
fischer leads the meeting due to chancellor gerhard schroeder 's vacations .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- france has thrown its support behind germany ’ s top diplomat joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- as a candidate for the likely new post .
fischer ’ s boss , german chancellor gerhard schröder and luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker have also spoken out in his favor . the 55-year-old fischer is leader of the green party in germany and has been the country ’ s foreign minister and vice-chancellor since 1998 .
he won high praise and international recognition for his skillful mediation between israel and the palestinians . fischer , however , is playing down any suggestions that he will be moving to brussels , saying he is happy being germany ’ s top diplomat . a long last spurt to ratification while the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at the summit in greece in july , diplomats have said only the first part of the draft constitution may be ready by then . greece ’ s foreign minister , george papandreou , has said that suggestions to extend the convention past the july deadline in order to give delegates more time to work out controversial points is a “ logical proposal . ” after the draft is completed , eu governments will then have until spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .
that is not expected until 2006 at the earliest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fischer touted for top eu foreign policy job german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .

in a two-day referendum , a majority of slovaks voted to join the european union .
the country 's leading parties breathed a collective sigh of relief that enough voters turned out . slovakia 's voters have decided to join the european union .
the central election commission in bratislava announced on sunday that 92.46 percent of votes cast in the referendum were in favor of joining the eu .
the officials said 52.12 percent of those registered voted , slightly more than the 50 percent necessary for the referendum , which took place on friday and saturday , to be valid according to the slovak constitution . " the referendum is valid , and an overwhelming majority of our citizens said ' yes ' for slovakia to enter the eu .
good luck to you all in the eu , " prime minister mikulas dzurinda said in an address to the nation on saturday evening . the european commission welcomed the result , congratulating slovakia for " the overwhelming support for eu accession . "
" this demonstrates the strong will of the slovak people to join the european family of democratic nations as a member of the euorpean union , with equal rights and obligations , " it said in a statement . sluggish turnout opinion polls had shown that around 80 percent of slovaks wanted to accede to the eu , but people were sluggish about casting their votes .
by noon on saturday just 48 percent of the 4.2 million registered voters had been to the polls .
the day before , only 25 to 30 percent had voted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak president rudolf schuster , -lrb- center -rrb- , slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda -lrb- right -rrb- and speaker of parliament pavol hrusovsky shortly before polling stations closed at 2:00 p.m. on saturday , slovak radio and television broadcast a joint statement from president rudolf schuster -lrb- photo , center -rrb- and parliament speaker pavol hrusovsky -lrb- photo , left -rrb- appealing to their countrymen and women to vote . " we were sweating it out a bit in the morning and afternoon because it looked touch and go , but at the end of the day , it turned out fine , " european commission ambassador to slovakia eric van der linden told reuters . analysts attributed the low turnout to several factors .
they said that voters were expressing disillusionment with prime minister dzurinda 's center-right government , which had implemented harsh reforms that allowed the country to shake off the political and economic isolation it had been subjected to under the autocratic leadership of prime minister vladimir meciar in the mid-1990s . observers criticized the government 's promotional campaign in favor of joining the eu too , saying it had failed to explain what eu membership would mean for ordinary slovaks .
the government also reaped criticism for not publicizing information on the referendum in the language of the roma minority . even if the referendum had failed to attract 50 percent of the country 's voters , parliament could still have decided to join the eu .
but it would have been an embarrassment for both slovakia and for the european commission .
all of slovakia 's leading political parties support eu membership . slovakia is the fifth country to vote to join the eu in the group of nine candidate countries scheduled to accede to the union in may 2004 .

the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels on thursday and friday to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .
there ’ s been heated debate about who will wield power in the future eu . a two-day meeting over a draft constitution for the future european union has been marked by clashes between bigger nations and smaller ones over who will hold the real reins of power as the eu expands into eastern europe next may . the delegates of the convention for the future of europe , who gathered in brussels at the end of this week , are racing against time to broker a compromise for the document that will be the legal underpinning of a new 25-member european union .
the draft is to be presented to eu leaders at a summit on june 20-21 . the constitution is designed to simplify the way the eu works in advance of its biggest ever expansion .
many of the rules governing the union were originally created for the six founding members of the european economic community in 1957 . some of the 105 delegates saw the meeting in brussels as a david and goliath story writ large .
smaller states like the benelux countries and austria accused giants like germany and france of riding roughshod over their concerns in supporting a controversial future framework that smaller members feel would cement power in the hands of the “ big five ” — france , britain , spain , germany and italy — and relegate the small countries to the sidelines . big vs. small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi during a press conference at the zappeion hall in athens , wednesday , april 16 , 2003 .
ten nations will sign treaties to join the european union on wednesday , including eight former communist countries cut off from their western neighbors until little more than a decade ago .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the main contention has centered around a suggestion put forward by valéry giscard d ’ estaing , former french president and head of the eu convention -lrb- photo , right , with romano prodi -rrb- , to appoint a long-term president to the european council , the eu ’ s main decision-making body . giscard d ’ estaing has said such sweeping reform of the system is necessary if the bloc , which expands from 15 to 25 member states next year , wants to avoid decision-making paralysis .
he says a president appointed from the ranks of former national leaders for terms of up to five years would give the eu continuity , instead of the current “ musical chairs ” system in which the council presidency rotates among member states every six months . but smaller states suspect that such a redesigned presidency would be dominated by the big states .
since the council president chairs eu summits and helps set the bloc ’ s strategic course , smaller nations fear the new structure would cement larger members ’ hold on power .
they also fear the giscard d ’ estaing plan would weaken the role of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies . “ so far 101 members of the convention have presented a petition against the long-term council president , 15 governments , ” said austrian delegate johannes voggenhuber .

i know there is a deal there to be done , ” peter hain , the british government representative told reuters .
he said privately almost all of the smaller countries had told him they accepted that they had to “ do a deal ” on the presidency . he and german foreign minister joschka fischer suggested that a plan to strengthen the european commission might help seal an accord with the small states .
the idea would streamline the eu executive and have its president elected by the european parliament . “ we ’ re not far from something we all can agree on , ” fischer said . an eu foreign minister ? on friday , delegates backed a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile and to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .

what began as a union of equals in may 1993 , quickly developed a western german focus . double names are one of those things .
on the one hand , they 're supposed to show that spouses remain independent after the wedding .
on the other , they 're often hard to understand , and sooner or later one of the names is often dropped for the sake of simplicity . the case is no different in politics . ten years ago , the eastern german grassroots movement alliance 90 merged with the green party from western germany , but nowadays there 's only talk of the greens .
that 's because there 's not much left of alliance 90 in the small governing coalition party , which says it has 45,000 members , only 6,000 of which are in eastern germany and berlin . during celebrations of the fusion in leipzig on saturday the party announced that it 's " time to flourish . "
the evening was marked by optimism about the party 's future , and the focus was on improving election results in eastern german states . party head reinhard bütikofer looked forward to the party polling double-digit results in eastern german saxony - in 10 years . a decade since the fusion , the greens have become a predominantly western german , urban party , that is n't particularly well received in the eastern german states . union of equals on may 17 , 1993 , however , heiko weigel , the then-head of the alliance in eastern german saxony announced the successful fusion at a party convention in leipzig .
" from here on , it 's just alliance 90 / the greens and just jointly , " he proclaimed . at the time , the eastern greens were on top of things , the only representatives of the party in parliament .
the western party had ignored german unification in 1990 , instead making climate protection their main campaign issue in federal parliamentary elections and consequently loosing their mandates .
the eastern greens , however , reached the five percent hurdle necessary to sit in parliament . there were fears that alliance 90 , with around 5,600 members , would be swallowed up by the roughly 34,000 greens .
they were different from their friends from the west : less dogmatic , willing to enter into coalitions with the conservatives .
their main issues were rebuilding eastern germany , democracy and coming to terms with east germany 's communist past , much less so environmental protection . then a state minister in western german hesse , joschka fischer - today the unofficial head of the greens and germany 's foreign minister - commented 10 years ago , " the time when we were essentially a protest party - as important as it was - this time finally came to an end for the greens / alliance 90 with german unification . " as a joint party alliance 90 / the greens was in parliament for the first time in 1994 .
since 1998 they have been part of the ruling governmental coalition along with the social democratic party . but the party still does n't do well in eastern germany .
the urban , intellectual , student setting that made the western greens strong does n't exist there . the grassroots movement 's topics too have become consistently less important in the interval since the turbulent days of unification .
the greens are n't represented in any of the eastern german state parliaments anymore .
the last eastern german state minister was heidrun heidecke in saxony-anhalt in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens jürgen trittin , renate künast , joschka fischer and kerstin müller -lrb- from left -rrb- jubilate during their election party in berlin on sunday , sept .

but the greens ' last big success - in parliamentary elections in fall 2002 when the party won 8.6 percent of the votes , the best result in its history - have raised hopes that they can still make progress in eastern germany . " we have plenty of opportunities , and we 're going to use them , " green consumer protection minister renate künast told her party colleagues in leipzig . still , the best known eastern german speaker at the greens ' celebration on saturday was leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee - a social democrat . jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens to vote on party change after losing the two party chiefs who stewarded the greens to their best election results ever last year , members of the party are now voting on a major change to their charter .

the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels on thursday and friday to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .
there ’ s been heated debate about who will wield power in the future eu . a two-day meeting over a draft constitution for the future european union has been marked by clashes between bigger nations and smaller ones over who will hold the real reins of power as the eu expands into eastern europe next may . the delegates of the convention for the future of europe , who gathered in brussels at the end of this week , are racing against time to broker a compromise for the document that will be the legal underpinning of a new 25-member european union .
the draft is to be presented to eu leaders at a summit on june 20-21 . the constitution is designed to simplify the way the eu works in advance of its biggest ever expansion .
many of the rules governing the union were originally created for the six founding members of the european economic community in 1957 . some of the 105 delegates saw the meeting in brussels as a david and goliath story writ large .
smaller states like the benelux countries and austria accused giants like germany and france of riding roughshod over their concerns in supporting a controversial future framework that smaller members feel would cement power in the hands of the “ big five ” — france , britain , spain , germany and italy — and relegate the small countries to the sidelines . big vs. small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi during a press conference at the zappeion hall in athens , wednesday , april 16 , 2003 .
ten nations will sign treaties to join the european union on wednesday , including eight former communist countries cut off from their western neighbors until little more than a decade ago .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the main contention has centered around a suggestion put forward by valéry giscard d ’ estaing , former french president and head of the eu convention -lrb- photo , right , with romano prodi -rrb- , to appoint a long-term president to the european council , the eu ’ s main decision-making body . giscard d ’ estaing has said such sweeping reform of the system is necessary if the bloc , which expands from 15 to 25 member states next year , wants to avoid decision-making paralysis .
he says a president appointed from the ranks of former national leaders for terms of up to five years would give the eu continuity , instead of the current “ musical chairs ” system in which the council presidency rotates among member states every six months . but smaller states suspect that such a redesigned presidency would be dominated by the big states .
since the council president chairs eu summits and helps set the bloc ’ s strategic course , smaller nations fear the new structure would cement larger members ’ hold on power .
they also fear the giscard d ’ estaing plan would weaken the role of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies . “ so far 101 members of the convention have presented a petition against the long-term council president , 15 governments , ” said austrian delegate johannes voggenhuber .
“ isn ’ t that enough , or are we going to have to labor over this plan , which enjoys no majority and never will have a consensus , for weeks . ” deal in the works ? despite the strong differences of opinion expressed over the past two days , delegates from britain and germany have said they see the outlines of a compromise deal between the two positions emerging . “ there is a big contrast between the negotiating poses struck in public and what i know to be the case in private .
i know there is a deal there to be done , ” peter hain , the british government representative told reuters .
he said privately almost all of the smaller countries had told him they accepted that they had to “ do a deal ” on the presidency . he and german foreign minister joschka fischer suggested that a plan to strengthen the european commission might help seal an accord with the small states .
the idea would streamline the eu executive and have its president elected by the european parliament . “ we ’ re not far from something we all can agree on , ” fischer said . an eu foreign minister ? on friday , delegates backed a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile and to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commission for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer on the way to the cabinet meeting in berlin chancellery wednesday , july 10 , 2002 .
fischer leads the meeting due to chancellor gerhard schroeder 's vacations .
-lrb- ap photo / roberto pfeil -rrb- france has thrown its support behind germany ’ s top diplomat joschka fischer -lrb- photo -rrb- as a candidate for the likely new post .
fischer ’ s boss , german chancellor gerhard schröder and luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker have also spoken out in his favor . the 55-year-old fischer is leader of the green party in germany and has been the country ’ s foreign minister and vice-chancellor since 1998 .
he won high praise and international recognition for his skillful mediation between israel and the palestinians . fischer , however , is playing down any suggestions that he will be moving to brussels , saying he is happy being germany ’ s top diplomat . a long last spurt to ratification while the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at the summit in greece in july , diplomats have said only the first part of the draft constitution may be ready by then . greece ’ s foreign minister , george papandreou , has said that suggestions to extend the convention past the july deadline in order to give delegates more time to work out controversial points is a “ logical proposal . ” after the draft is completed , eu governments will then have until spring to thrash out differences .
a new eu constitution will only come into force when all 25 members have ratified it .
that is not expected until 2006 at the earliest . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's fischer touted for top eu foreign policy job german foreign minster joschka fischer has long been a staunch european federalist .
now , as the european union debates the merits of a common foreign policy , he could become the eu 's first foreign minister .
france , germany defend joint eu constitution proposal germany and france 's foreign ministers sought to build support for their eu constitution proposal on tuesday , but faced stiff resistance from members of the constitutional convention .
reactions mixed to draft eu constitution former french president valery giscard d 'estaing unveiled the first draft of a new european constitution on monday that could lead to a " united europe " with an elected president and increased federalism .

in a two-day referendum , a majority of slovaks voted to join the european union .
the country 's leading parties breathed a collective sigh of relief that enough voters turned out . slovakia 's voters have decided to join the european union .
the central election commission in bratislava announced on sunday that 92.46 percent of votes cast in the referendum were in favor of joining the eu .
the officials said 52.12 percent of those registered voted , slightly more than the 50 percent necessary for the referendum , which took place on friday and saturday , to be valid according to the slovak constitution . " the referendum is valid , and an overwhelming majority of our citizens said ' yes ' for slovakia to enter the eu .
good luck to you all in the eu , " prime minister mikulas dzurinda said in an address to the nation on saturday evening . the european commission welcomed the result , congratulating slovakia for " the overwhelming support for eu accession . "
" this demonstrates the strong will of the slovak people to join the european family of democratic nations as a member of the euorpean union , with equal rights and obligations , " it said in a statement . sluggish turnout opinion polls had shown that around 80 percent of slovaks wanted to accede to the eu , but people were sluggish about casting their votes .
by noon on saturday just 48 percent of the 4.2 million registered voters had been to the polls .
the day before , only 25 to 30 percent had voted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak president rudolf schuster , -lrb- center -rrb- , slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda -lrb- right -rrb- and speaker of parliament pavol hrusovsky shortly before polling stations closed at 2:00 p.m. on saturday , slovak radio and television broadcast a joint statement from president rudolf schuster -lrb- photo , center -rrb- and parliament speaker pavol hrusovsky -lrb- photo , left -rrb- appealing to their countrymen and women to vote . " we were sweating it out a bit in the morning and afternoon because it looked touch and go , but at the end of the day , it turned out fine , " european commission ambassador to slovakia eric van der linden told reuters . analysts attributed the low turnout to several factors .
they said that voters were expressing disillusionment with prime minister dzurinda 's center-right government , which had implemented harsh reforms that allowed the country to shake off the political and economic isolation it had been subjected to under the autocratic leadership of prime minister vladimir meciar in the mid-1990s . observers criticized the government 's promotional campaign in favor of joining the eu too , saying it had failed to explain what eu membership would mean for ordinary slovaks .
the government also reaped criticism for not publicizing information on the referendum in the language of the roma minority . even if the referendum had failed to attract 50 percent of the country 's voters , parliament could still have decided to join the eu .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 18.05.2003 time for the greens to flourish großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ten years after the merger : just call us the greens two and a half years after german unification , the western german green party and the eastern german alliance 90 joined forces .
what began as a union of equals in may 1993 , quickly developed a western german focus . double names are one of those things .
on the one hand , they 're supposed to show that spouses remain independent after the wedding .
on the other , they 're often hard to understand , and sooner or later one of the names is often dropped for the sake of simplicity . the case is no different in politics . ten years ago , the eastern german grassroots movement alliance 90 merged with the green party from western germany , but nowadays there 's only talk of the greens .
that 's because there 's not much left of alliance 90 in the small governing coalition party , which says it has 45,000 members , only 6,000 of which are in eastern germany and berlin . during celebrations of the fusion in leipzig on saturday the party announced that it 's " time to flourish . "
the evening was marked by optimism about the party 's future , and the focus was on improving election results in eastern german states . party head reinhard bütikofer looked forward to the party polling double-digit results in eastern german saxony - in 10 years . a decade since the fusion , the greens have become a predominantly western german , urban party , that is n't particularly well received in the eastern german states . union of equals on may 17 , 1993 , however , heiko weigel , the then-head of the alliance in eastern german saxony announced the successful fusion at a party convention in leipzig .
" from here on , it 's just alliance 90 / the greens and just jointly , " he proclaimed . at the time , the eastern greens were on top of things , the only representatives of the party in parliament .
the western party had ignored german unification in 1990 , instead making climate protection their main campaign issue in federal parliamentary elections and consequently loosing their mandates .
the eastern greens , however , reached the five percent hurdle necessary to sit in parliament . there were fears that alliance 90 , with around 5,600 members , would be swallowed up by the roughly 34,000 greens .
they were different from their friends from the west : less dogmatic , willing to enter into coalitions with the conservatives .
their main issues were rebuilding eastern germany , democracy and coming to terms with east germany 's communist past , much less so environmental protection . then a state minister in western german hesse , joschka fischer - today the unofficial head of the greens and germany 's foreign minister - commented 10 years ago , " the time when we were essentially a protest party - as important as it was - this time finally came to an end for the greens / alliance 90 with german unification . " as a joint party alliance 90 / the greens was in parliament for the first time in 1994 .
since 1998 they have been part of the ruling governmental coalition along with the social democratic party . but the party still does n't do well in eastern germany .
the urban , intellectual , student setting that made the western greens strong does n't exist there . the grassroots movement 's topics too have become consistently less important in the interval since the turbulent days of unification .
the greens are n't represented in any of the eastern german state parliaments anymore .
the last eastern german state minister was heidrun heidecke in saxony-anhalt in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens jürgen trittin , renate künast , joschka fischer and kerstin müller -lrb- from left -rrb- jubilate during their election party in berlin on sunday , sept .
22 , 2002 , after first results indicated that the greens received nearly nine percent .
but the greens ' last big success - in parliamentary elections in fall 2002 when the party won 8.6 percent of the votes , the best result in its history - have raised hopes that they can still make progress in eastern germany . " we have plenty of opportunities , and we 're going to use them , " green consumer protection minister renate künast told her party colleagues in leipzig . still , the best known eastern german speaker at the greens ' celebration on saturday was leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee - a social democrat . jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens to vote on party change after losing the two party chiefs who stewarded the greens to their best election results ever last year , members of the party are now voting on a major change to their charter .

the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels on thursday and friday to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .
there ’ s been heated debate about who will wield power in the future eu . a two-day meeting over a draft constitution for the future european union has been marked by clashes between bigger nations and smaller ones over who will hold the real reins of power as the eu expands into eastern europe next may . the delegates of the convention for the future of europe , who gathered in brussels at the end of this week , are racing against time to broker a compromise for the document that will be the legal underpinning of a new 25-member european union .
the draft is to be presented to eu leaders at a summit on june 20-21 . the constitution is designed to simplify the way the eu works in advance of its biggest ever expansion .
many of the rules governing the union were originally created for the six founding members of the european economic community in 1957 . some of the 105 delegates saw the meeting in brussels as a david and goliath story writ large .
smaller states like the benelux countries and austria accused giants like germany and france of riding roughshod over their concerns in supporting a controversial future framework that smaller members feel would cement power in the hands of the “ big five ” — france , britain , spain , germany and italy — and relegate the small countries to the sidelines . big vs. small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi during a press conference at the zappeion hall in athens , wednesday , april 16 , 2003 .
ten nations will sign treaties to join the european union on wednesday , including eight former communist countries cut off from their western neighbors until little more than a decade ago .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the main contention has centered around a suggestion put forward by valéry giscard d ’ estaing , former french president and head of the eu convention -lrb- photo , right , with romano prodi -rrb- , to appoint a long-term president to the european council , the eu ’ s main decision-making body . giscard d ’ estaing has said such sweeping reform of the system is necessary if the bloc , which expands from 15 to 25 member states next year , wants to avoid decision-making paralysis .
he says a president appointed from the ranks of former national leaders for terms of up to five years would give the eu continuity , instead of the current “ musical chairs ” system in which the council presidency rotates among member states every six months . but smaller states suspect that such a redesigned presidency would be dominated by the big states .
since the council president chairs eu summits and helps set the bloc ’ s strategic course , smaller nations fear the new structure would cement larger members ’ hold on power .
they also fear the giscard d ’ estaing plan would weaken the role of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies . “ so far 101 members of the convention have presented a petition against the long-term council president , 15 governments , ” said austrian delegate johannes voggenhuber .
“ isn ’ t that enough , or are we going to have to labor over this plan , which enjoys no majority and never will have a consensus , for weeks . ” deal in the works ? despite the strong differences of opinion expressed over the past two days , delegates from britain and germany have said they see the outlines of a compromise deal between the two positions emerging . “ there is a big contrast between the negotiating poses struck in public and what i know to be the case in private .
i know there is a deal there to be done , ” peter hain , the british government representative told reuters .
he said privately almost all of the smaller countries had told him they accepted that they had to “ do a deal ” on the presidency . he and german foreign minister joschka fischer suggested that a plan to strengthen the european commission might help seal an accord with the small states .
the idea would streamline the eu executive and have its president elected by the european parliament . “ we ’ re not far from something we all can agree on , ” fischer said . an eu foreign minister ? on friday , delegates backed a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile and to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commission for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer on the way to the cabinet meeting in berlin chancellery wednesday , july 10 , 2002 .

fischer ’ s boss , german chancellor gerhard schröder and luxembourg ’ s prime minister jean-claude juncker have also spoken out in his favor . the 55-year-old fischer is leader of the green party in germany and has been the country ’ s foreign minister and vice-chancellor since 1998 .
he won high praise and international recognition for his skillful mediation between israel and the palestinians . fischer , however , is playing down any suggestions that he will be moving to brussels , saying he is happy being germany ’ s top diplomat . a long last spurt to ratification while the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at the summit in greece in july , diplomats have said only the first part of the draft constitution may be ready by then . greece ’ s foreign minister , george papandreou , has said that suggestions to extend the convention past the july deadline in order to give delegates more time to work out controversial points is a “ logical proposal . ” after the draft is completed , eu governments will then have until spring to thrash out differences .

the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels on thursday and friday to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .
there ’ s been heated debate about who will wield power in the future eu . a two-day meeting over a draft constitution for the future european union has been marked by clashes between bigger nations and smaller ones over who will hold the real reins of power as the eu expands into eastern europe next may . the delegates of the convention for the future of europe , who gathered in brussels at the end of this week , are racing against time to broker a compromise for the document that will be the legal underpinning of a new 25-member european union .
the draft is to be presented to eu leaders at a summit on june 20-21 . the constitution is designed to simplify the way the eu works in advance of its biggest ever expansion .
many of the rules governing the union were originally created for the six founding members of the european economic community in 1957 . some of the 105 delegates saw the meeting in brussels as a david and goliath story writ large .
smaller states like the benelux countries and austria accused giants like germany and france of riding roughshod over their concerns in supporting a controversial future framework that smaller members feel would cement power in the hands of the “ big five ” — france , britain , spain , germany and italy — and relegate the small countries to the sidelines . big vs. small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi during a press conference at the zappeion hall in athens , wednesday , april 16 , 2003 .
ten nations will sign treaties to join the european union on wednesday , including eight former communist countries cut off from their western neighbors until little more than a decade ago .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the main contention has centered around a suggestion put forward by valéry giscard d ’ estaing , former french president and head of the eu convention -lrb- photo , right , with romano prodi -rrb- , to appoint a long-term president to the european council , the eu ’ s main decision-making body . giscard d ’ estaing has said such sweeping reform of the system is necessary if the bloc , which expands from 15 to 25 member states next year , wants to avoid decision-making paralysis .
he says a president appointed from the ranks of former national leaders for terms of up to five years would give the eu continuity , instead of the current “ musical chairs ” system in which the council presidency rotates among member states every six months . but smaller states suspect that such a redesigned presidency would be dominated by the big states .
since the council president chairs eu summits and helps set the bloc ’ s strategic course , smaller nations fear the new structure would cement larger members ’ hold on power .
they also fear the giscard d ’ estaing plan would weaken the role of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies . “ so far 101 members of the convention have presented a petition against the long-term council president , 15 governments , ” said austrian delegate johannes voggenhuber .
“ isn ’ t that enough , or are we going to have to labor over this plan , which enjoys no majority and never will have a consensus , for weeks . ” deal in the works ? despite the strong differences of opinion expressed over the past two days , delegates from britain and germany have said they see the outlines of a compromise deal between the two positions emerging . “ there is a big contrast between the negotiating poses struck in public and what i know to be the case in private .
i know there is a deal there to be done , ” peter hain , the british government representative told reuters .
he said privately almost all of the smaller countries had told him they accepted that they had to “ do a deal ” on the presidency . he and german foreign minister joschka fischer suggested that a plan to strengthen the european commission might help seal an accord with the small states .
the idea would streamline the eu executive and have its president elected by the european parliament . “ we ’ re not far from something we all can agree on , ” fischer said . an eu foreign minister ? on friday , delegates backed a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile and to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .
under the draft plan , the new foreign minister would combine the jobs of javier solana , the eu ’ s current foreign and security policy chief , with that of chris patten , the eu ’ s commission for external relations , who controls the foreign aid budget . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german foreign minister joschka fischer on the way to the cabinet meeting in berlin chancellery wednesday , july 10 , 2002 .

in a two-day referendum , a majority of slovaks voted to join the european union .
the country 's leading parties breathed a collective sigh of relief that enough voters turned out . slovakia 's voters have decided to join the european union .
the central election commission in bratislava announced on sunday that 92.46 percent of votes cast in the referendum were in favor of joining the eu .
the officials said 52.12 percent of those registered voted , slightly more than the 50 percent necessary for the referendum , which took place on friday and saturday , to be valid according to the slovak constitution . " the referendum is valid , and an overwhelming majority of our citizens said ' yes ' for slovakia to enter the eu .
good luck to you all in the eu , " prime minister mikulas dzurinda said in an address to the nation on saturday evening . the european commission welcomed the result , congratulating slovakia for " the overwhelming support for eu accession . "
" this demonstrates the strong will of the slovak people to join the european family of democratic nations as a member of the euorpean union , with equal rights and obligations , " it said in a statement . sluggish turnout opinion polls had shown that around 80 percent of slovaks wanted to accede to the eu , but people were sluggish about casting their votes .

" we were sweating it out a bit in the morning and afternoon because it looked touch and go , but at the end of the day , it turned out fine , " european commission ambassador to slovakia eric van der linden told reuters . analysts attributed the low turnout to several factors .
they said that voters were expressing disillusionment with prime minister dzurinda 's center-right government , which had implemented harsh reforms that allowed the country to shake off the political and economic isolation it had been subjected to under the autocratic leadership of prime minister vladimir meciar in the mid-1990s . observers criticized the government 's promotional campaign in favor of joining the eu too , saying it had failed to explain what eu membership would mean for ordinary slovaks .
the government also reaped criticism for not publicizing information on the referendum in the language of the roma minority . even if the referendum had failed to attract 50 percent of the country 's voters , parliament could still have decided to join the eu .

in a two-day referendum , a majority of slovaks voted to join the european union .
the country 's leading parties breathed a collective sigh of relief that enough voters turned out . slovakia 's voters have decided to join the european union .
the central election commission in bratislava announced on sunday that 92.46 percent of votes cast in the referendum were in favor of joining the eu .
the officials said 52.12 percent of those registered voted , slightly more than the 50 percent necessary for the referendum , which took place on friday and saturday , to be valid according to the slovak constitution . " the referendum is valid , and an overwhelming majority of our citizens said ' yes ' for slovakia to enter the eu .
good luck to you all in the eu , " prime minister mikulas dzurinda said in an address to the nation on saturday evening . the european commission welcomed the result , congratulating slovakia for " the overwhelming support for eu accession . "
" this demonstrates the strong will of the slovak people to join the european family of democratic nations as a member of the euorpean union , with equal rights and obligations , " it said in a statement . sluggish turnout opinion polls had shown that around 80 percent of slovaks wanted to accede to the eu , but people were sluggish about casting their votes .
by noon on saturday just 48 percent of the 4.2 million registered voters had been to the polls .
the day before , only 25 to 30 percent had voted . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak president rudolf schuster , -lrb- center -rrb- , slovak prime minister mikulas dzurinda -lrb- right -rrb- and speaker of parliament pavol hrusovsky shortly before polling stations closed at 2:00 p.m. on saturday , slovak radio and television broadcast a joint statement from president rudolf schuster -lrb- photo , center -rrb- and parliament speaker pavol hrusovsky -lrb- photo , left -rrb- appealing to their countrymen and women to vote .

what began as a union of equals in may 1993 , quickly developed a western german focus . double names are one of those things .
on the one hand , they 're supposed to show that spouses remain independent after the wedding .
on the other , they 're often hard to understand , and sooner or later one of the names is often dropped for the sake of simplicity . the case is no different in politics . ten years ago , the eastern german grassroots movement alliance 90 merged with the green party from western germany , but nowadays there 's only talk of the greens .
that 's because there 's not much left of alliance 90 in the small governing coalition party , which says it has 45,000 members , only 6,000 of which are in eastern germany and berlin . during celebrations of the fusion in leipzig on saturday the party announced that it 's " time to flourish . "
the evening was marked by optimism about the party 's future , and the focus was on improving election results in eastern german states . party head reinhard bütikofer looked forward to the party polling double-digit results in eastern german saxony - in 10 years . a decade since the fusion , the greens have become a predominantly western german , urban party , that is n't particularly well received in the eastern german states . union of equals on may 17 , 1993 , however , heiko weigel , the then-head of the alliance in eastern german saxony announced the successful fusion at a party convention in leipzig .

the western party had ignored german unification in 1990 , instead making climate protection their main campaign issue in federal parliamentary elections and consequently loosing their mandates .
the eastern greens , however , reached the five percent hurdle necessary to sit in parliament . there were fears that alliance 90 , with around 5,600 members , would be swallowed up by the roughly 34,000 greens .
they were different from their friends from the west : less dogmatic , willing to enter into coalitions with the conservatives .
their main issues were rebuilding eastern germany , democracy and coming to terms with east germany 's communist past , much less so environmental protection . then a state minister in western german hesse , joschka fischer - today the unofficial head of the greens and germany 's foreign minister - commented 10 years ago , " the time when we were essentially a protest party - as important as it was - this time finally came to an end for the greens / alliance 90 with german unification .

since 1998 they have been part of the ruling governmental coalition along with the social democratic party . but the party still does n't do well in eastern germany .
the urban , intellectual , student setting that made the western greens strong does n't exist there . the grassroots movement 's topics too have become consistently less important in the interval since the turbulent days of unification .

the western party had ignored german unification in 1990 , instead making climate protection their main campaign issue in federal parliamentary elections and consequently loosing their mandates .
the eastern greens , however , reached the five percent hurdle necessary to sit in parliament . there were fears that alliance 90 , with around 5,600 members , would be swallowed up by the roughly 34,000 greens .
they were different from their friends from the west : less dogmatic , willing to enter into coalitions with the conservatives .
their main issues were rebuilding eastern germany , democracy and coming to terms with east germany 's communist past , much less so environmental protection . then a state minister in western german hesse , joschka fischer - today the unofficial head of the greens and germany 's foreign minister - commented 10 years ago , " the time when we were essentially a protest party - as important as it was - this time finally came to an end for the greens / alliance 90 with german unification . " as a joint party alliance 90 / the greens was in parliament for the first time in 1994 .
since 1998 they have been part of the ruling governmental coalition along with the social democratic party . but the party still does n't do well in eastern germany .
the urban , intellectual , student setting that made the western greens strong does n't exist there . the grassroots movement 's topics too have become consistently less important in the interval since the turbulent days of unification .
the greens are n't represented in any of the eastern german state parliaments anymore .
the last eastern german state minister was heidrun heidecke in saxony-anhalt in 1998 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greens jürgen trittin , renate künast , joschka fischer and kerstin müller -lrb- from left -rrb- jubilate during their election party in berlin on sunday , sept .
22 , 2002 , after first results indicated that the greens received nearly nine percent .
but the greens ' last big success - in parliamentary elections in fall 2002 when the party won 8.6 percent of the votes , the best result in its history - have raised hopes that they can still make progress in eastern germany . " we have plenty of opportunities , and we 're going to use them , " green consumer protection minister renate künast told her party colleagues in leipzig . still , the best known eastern german speaker at the greens ' celebration on saturday was leipzig 's mayor , wolfgang tiefensee - a social democrat . jens thurau send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de greens to vote on party change after losing the two party chiefs who stewarded the greens to their best election results ever last year , members of the party are now voting on a major change to their charter .

the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels on thursday and friday to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .
there ’ s been heated debate about who will wield power in the future eu . a two-day meeting over a draft constitution for the future european union has been marked by clashes between bigger nations and smaller ones over who will hold the real reins of power as the eu expands into eastern europe next may . the delegates of the convention for the future of europe , who gathered in brussels at the end of this week , are racing against time to broker a compromise for the document that will be the legal underpinning of a new 25-member european union .
the draft is to be presented to eu leaders at a summit on june 20-21 . the constitution is designed to simplify the way the eu works in advance of its biggest ever expansion .
many of the rules governing the union were originally created for the six founding members of the european economic community in 1957 . some of the 105 delegates saw the meeting in brussels as a david and goliath story writ large .
smaller states like the benelux countries and austria accused giants like germany and france of riding roughshod over their concerns in supporting a controversial future framework that smaller members feel would cement power in the hands of the “ big five ” — france , britain , spain , germany and italy — and relegate the small countries to the sidelines . big vs. small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi during a press conference at the zappeion hall in athens , wednesday , april 16 , 2003 .
ten nations will sign treaties to join the european union on wednesday , including eight former communist countries cut off from their western neighbors until little more than a decade ago .
-lrb- ap photo / yves logghe -rrb- the main contention has centered around a suggestion put forward by valéry giscard d ’ estaing , former french president and head of the eu convention -lrb- photo , right , with romano prodi -rrb- , to appoint a long-term president to the european council , the eu ’ s main decision-making body . giscard d ’ estaing has said such sweeping reform of the system is necessary if the bloc , which expands from 15 to 25 member states next year , wants to avoid decision-making paralysis .
he says a president appointed from the ranks of former national leaders for terms of up to five years would give the eu continuity , instead of the current “ musical chairs ” system in which the council presidency rotates among member states every six months . but smaller states suspect that such a redesigned presidency would be dominated by the big states .
since the council president chairs eu summits and helps set the bloc ’ s strategic course , smaller nations fear the new structure would cement larger members ’ hold on power .
they also fear the giscard d ’ estaing plan would weaken the role of the european commission , the body which proposes laws and enforces common eu policies . “ so far 101 members of the convention have presented a petition against the long-term council president , 15 governments , ” said austrian delegate johannes voggenhuber .

i know there is a deal there to be done , ” peter hain , the british government representative told reuters .
he said privately almost all of the smaller countries had told him they accepted that they had to “ do a deal ” on the presidency . he and german foreign minister joschka fischer suggested that a plan to strengthen the european commission might help seal an accord with the small states .
the idea would streamline the eu executive and have its president elected by the european parliament . “ we ’ re not far from something we all can agree on , ” fischer said . an eu foreign minister ? on friday , delegates backed a plan to create an eu foreign minister post , in part to boost the eu ’ s global profile and to have a single person coordinating the union ’ s common foreign , security and defense policies .

he won high praise and international recognition for his skillful mediation between israel and the palestinians . fischer , however , is playing down any suggestions that he will be moving to brussels , saying he is happy being germany ’ s top diplomat . a long last spurt to ratification while the draft proposal is supposed to be submitted to eu leaders at the summit in greece in july , diplomats have said only the first part of the draft constitution may be ready by then . greece ’ s foreign minister , george papandreou , has said that suggestions to extend the convention past the july deadline in order to give delegates more time to work out controversial points is a “ logical proposal . ” after the draft is completed , eu governments will then have until spring to thrash out differences .

the authors of a future european constitution met in brussels on thursday and friday to hammer out a draft in time for a summit in late june .
there ’ s been heated debate about who will wield power in the future eu . a two-day meeting over a draft constitution for the future european union has been marked by clashes between bigger nations and smaller ones over who will hold the real reins of power as the eu expands into eastern europe next may . the delegates of the convention for the future of europe , who gathered in brussels at the end of this week , are racing against time to broker a compromise for the document that will be the legal underpinning of a new 25-member european union .
the draft is to be presented to eu leaders at a summit on june 20-21 . the constitution is designed to simplify the way the eu works in advance of its biggest ever expansion .
many of the rules governing the union were originally created for the six founding members of the european economic community in 1957 . some of the 105 delegates saw the meeting in brussels as a david and goliath story writ large .
smaller states like the benelux countries and austria accused giants like germany and france of riding roughshod over their concerns in supporting a controversial future framework that smaller members feel would cement power in the hands of the “ big five ” — france , britain , spain , germany and italy — and relegate the small countries to the sidelines . big vs. small bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european convention president valery giscard d 'estaing , right gestures next to eu commission president romano prodi during a press conference at the zappeion hall in athens , wednesday , april 16 , 2003 .

and there do not appear to be any restrictions on who can apply for the £ 33,000-a-year post .
the successful applicant will replace present bishop of hereford john oliver in december , reports the sunday times .
the see of hereford comes with a rent-free 18th-century house near the cathedral , a gardener , a chauffeur and office staff .
it is the first time in the church 's 470-year history it has issued a job advertisement .
in the past , appointments have been made behind closed doors by senior church people in the crown appointments commission .
this is part of a deliberate attempt to demystify and open up the process prof michael clarke chaired by the archbishop of canterbury , it is so private candidates are not even interviewed .
however a recent committee on appointments recommended that they should be done more openly , and called for job interviews .
the hereford advert is seen as a nod towards those recommendations .
professor michael clarke , head of the appointments committee , told the sunday times : " this is part of a deliberate attempt to demystify and open up the process of appointing bishops . "
women need not apply because they are barred from becoming bishops .
but there is nothing to stop a non-ordained person being considered .
st thomas becket , for example , who is considered to be the greatest archbishop of canterbury , was not a priest when he was appointed .
however it is unlikely someone unconnected with the church would be appointed .

us researchers studying the best way to find information online say trying the same query on different search engines rarely produces the best results .
instead searchers should become more familiar with their favourite search engine and use its advanced features to refine results .
the researchers found that only 10 % of net seekers were tuning their searches using the extras offered by most search sites .
smooth operator the good thing about the net is the depth and diversity of information online .
but this does mean that it is often hard to separate what you want from the mass of irrelevant webpages thrown up by almost every net search .
us researchers bernard jansen and caroline eastman studied the way that people look for information online and found that the individual quirks of search sites make it hard to define a single strategy to find what you want every time .
top search tips stick to one search engine get to know its advanced features be as specific as possible put search term in quotes use words like " or " , " must appear " or " not " " there are no wholesale rules about structuring a query that will work on multiple search engines , " said bernard jansen , assistant professor of information sciences and technology at penn state university .
" and what works on one engine , such as narrowing a query , can have the opposite effect on other search engines , " he said .
for instance , refining a search on google using " or " significantly changes the results it returns but does not have the same effect on the msn and aol search sites .
in their study of 600 queries the two scientists found that 60 % of results returned for a particular set of terms will be the same across all search sites .
instead of looking for the pages that every search engine returns when searching , professor jansen and his co-author recommend that users become as familiar as possible with one search engine and stick to it .
the researchers found that only 10 % of people refine the results served up to them using words such as " or " , " must appear " or try to ensure their search terms are treated as a single phrase .
refining a search with such words can make a big difference to the numbers of pages returned .
for instance , looking up " monkey " and " tennis " on google produces 109,000 hits .
by contrast , searching for " monkey tennis " as a phrase returns only 2,200 .
professor jansen said users who understood how best to search on one or two engines should use them until systems designers figure out how to personalise information retrieval .
