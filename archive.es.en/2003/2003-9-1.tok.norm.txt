but the eu 's influence there is limited . it was actually the european union which devised the " road map " to peace in the middle east .
the first draft emerged during the danish presidency of the eu in autumn 2002 , according to chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations .
the remaining members of the middle east quartet - the united states , russia and the united nations - accepted and reworked the eu 's plan to create a viable palestinian state and bring an end to terror in the region , patten has said . the united states sees it differently .
at a summit meeting with the israeli and palestinian prime ministers to adopt the road map in early june 2003 , president george w. bush made no mention of the eu .
the united states does n't consider europe an important player in the middle east . too friendly to the palestinians ? the european union , however , has had a special representative for the middle east peace process since 1996 .
in mid-july 2003 belgian diplomat marc otte took over the position . eu high representative for common foreign and security policy javier solana - something like a predecessor to a european foreign minister - is traveling through the region from august 29 to september 3 .
he has been personally engaged in the peace process . but as far as the u.s. and israel are concerned he is too friendly with the palestinians .
solana refuses to break off contacts with palestinian president yassir arafat and only communicate with the palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas , as the u.s. and israel do .
solana also finds it difficult sometimes to curry the support of eu foreign ministers ' for the frustrating peace process with its numerous setbacks . former nato secretary-general solana has written that particularly during times of despair europeans must strengthen their efforts .
the italian presidency of the eu has indicated it would like to bring together the ministers of the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the united states , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- in september .
french president jacques chirac has repeatedly called for europe to speak with one voice in the middle east too .
he has even said he would suggest a second road map to work for peace between israel and syria as well as between israel and lebanon . the eu as financier the eu does n't play a leading role on the political stage , but it does when it comes to financing the palestinian authority and humanitarian aid in the gaza strip and the west bank . according to chris patten , the eu has pumped € 10 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- into the palestinian authority every month since june 2001 just to ensure its continued existence - that is , paying a large part of the salaries of the more than 120,000 employees .
after the second intifada began israel froze the financial flows of tax and customs revenues to the palestinian authority .
the eu filled the gap . the european commission granted the palestinian authority an additional € 100 million in july , € 30 million of which were earmarked just for improving roads .
the peace plans came and went ; the eu continued to pay - more than half a billion euros for direct aid , loans and humanitarian programs in 2002 and 2003 alone . accusations from the media and eu parliamentarians that aid money has been misappropriated by the palestinian authority , headed by yassir arafat , have been dismissed by the accountants in brussels .
numerous independent audits had shown that nothing has gone astray , according to chris patten . aid for israel economic relations with israel are also close .
the eu is israel 's biggest trade partner and since 1995 israel has been part of a special eu program along with all of the mediterranean countries , from which aid money is distributed to israel and its neighbors . despite terror attacks and retaliatory strikes , direct contacts between the israelis and the palestinians continue when it comes to practical issues with the help of the eu .
the eu mediated an agreement between the israeli minister for infrastructure , joseph pritzky , and palestinian energy minister azzam shawwa on joint projects concerning energy supplies . such projects are just what eu high representative solana likes to see .
the spaniard is anxious to help create a climate of trust between the two sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.09.2003 german-turkish relations scrutinized on eve of erdogan visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister erdogan will arrive in berlin with a busy agenda turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan arrives in germany on monday night for a visit that promises to be full of difficult discussions with german leaders . while in the capital for his first official visit , erdogan is scheduled to meet with chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer but is not expected not try and woo either for german support of his country ’ s accession to the european union . however , the subject of eu membership is unlikely to remain dormant while erdogan is in germany .
turkey is one of 13 candidates to join the 15-nation eu but , so far , it has been refused a starting date for its membership negotiations because brussels says it has not carried out sufficient reforms to bring its democracy up to western standards .
despite this , germany defended ankara ’ s bid at the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen last december .
fischer makes positive noises in contrast , german foreign minister fischer has recently praised turkish efforts to bring the country into line .
in an interview published on the day when the turkish prime minister is expected , fischer told the business daily handelsblatt newspaper : “ turkey is working seriously and intensively to further open the door to membership of the european union . ”
fischer ’ s words are likely to be the ice breaker at a time when relations between the two countries are certainly frosty .
ties have recently been strained by turkey ’ s decision to strip some of its nationals abroad of their passports for failing to do military service .
the federal government is afraid that the move by its turkish counterpart could leave germany with a number of stateless people of turkish origin who could not be deported even if they committed serious crimes and it has warned turkey the move could harm its eu bid .
kaplan affair could cause discomfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the " caliph of cologne . "
this could also lead to uncomfortable discussions surrounding the fate of metin kaplan , an extremist leader known as the “ caliph of cologne ” who is living in germany and who is wanted by ankara for treason .
turkey has demanded that kaplan be extradited but this move was blocked last week by a german court .
unhappy voices speaking out from ankara about the kaplan affair have already made themselves heard in germany on the day erdogan arrives .
hüseyin diriöz , spokesperson for the turkish foreign ministry , said on monday that the german decision to block ankara ’ s attempts at extradition were “ wrong , unjustified , with prejudices and inadequate assessments of the independent turkish justice system . ”
conservatives oppose eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian governor edmund stoiber .
turkey is also facing opposition within the german parliament to its eu plans .
germany ’ s conservatives have made it known that they are against the idea of turkey joining the bloc with german help .
edmund stoiber , the premier of the state of bavaria , voiced his party ’ s views during last year ’ s general election , saying “ for us , eu membership for turkey is inconceivable . ” germans opposed to turkey ’ s accession range from those who feel turkey ’ s islamic culture would not fit within that of europe to those concerned about the effect of turkish workers on the ailing labor market .
germany is home to more than two million turks , estimated to be the largest turkish community in western europe and is turkey ’ s most important business partner . reformist association to open in berlin business will certainly be on the agenda in some capacity when erdogan begins his visit proper .
the turkish premier will open the berlin branch of the turkish industrial association , tüsiad , in the capital .
the association has been behind a number of radical reform process ideas in turkey that have been linked with the country ’ s push for eu memebership . it is also likely that erdogan and the germans will discuss the possibility of easing arms export restrictions that have stopped the federal government supplying turkey with battle tanks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish leader hopes berlin will support eu bid turkish prime minister erdogan visits germany on monday , hoping berlin will support ankara ’ s eu bid .
but germany remains split even as media reports say it could ease arms export restrictions to turkey .
-lrb- august 31 , 2003 -rrb- turkey pushes forward on eu reform course in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership .
-lrb- august 6 , 2003 -rrb- germany still wary of turkey 's eu aspirations turkish president ahmet sezer is in berlin to rally support for eu membership .
but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold .

but all that could change if the goethe institute ’ s new publicity campaign goes as planned . okay , pop quiz : what ’ s the first thing that comes into your head when you hear the word “ germany ” ?
if you ’ re british , the most popular answers may be adolf hitler , nazis and penalty shoot-outs . given that many britons have a negative view of germany – wars , world cups , towels on beach chairs , etc . – and have little interest in the language and culture , the goethe institute in london has launched a campaign aimed at promoting the learning of german and making the country ’ s image more attractive . the goethe institute , which promotes germany abroad , recently carried out a study in its london branch on the attitudes british people have towards germany and their knowledge about the country and its culture .
the result : there is a severe lack of interest in all things german . history stops at hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : history stops here .
the research showed that britons as a whole suffer from a particularly nasty case of skewed perception thanks to television schedules which tend to be packed with documentaries about the nazis and the holocaust - topics which also make up the majority of the history curriculum regarding germany in british schools .
armed with its new facts , figures and targets , the goethe institute is now fighting back with a publicity campaign which aims to fill mailboxes with postcards featuring übermodel claudia schiffer under the slogan “ learn german - and look good . ”
the campaign will target british students , teachers and cultural institutions .
" we 're very often asked how we intend to change opinions that have been entrenched for generations , " said karl pechatscheck , deputy director at the goethe institute in london in an interview with deutsche welle .

" the campaign is run by our language department , " said pechatscheck , head of the section .
" by targeting schools and teachers , we can help pupils decide to learn german , not the german of hitler but the german of the love parade with new ideas of what germany is . "

the company , deutsche system lotto gmbh , convinced an estimated 8,000 individuals throughout germany to enter into contracts that guaranteed a payout of up to € 125,000 -lrb- $ 137,000 -rrb- if they did not win a ‘ fiver ’ or ‘ sixer ’ lottery draw within a year .
the contracts stipulated that players pay from € 7 to € 700 weekly into a pool , funds from which were supposed to be used to play the lottery .
district attorneys investigating the case say no more than € 5,000 of the pool ’ s money actually went to lottery tickets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.09.2003 german-turkish relations scrutinized on eve of erdogan visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister erdogan will arrive in berlin with a busy agenda turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan arrives in germany on monday night for a visit that promises to be full of difficult discussions with german leaders . while in the capital for his first official visit , erdogan is scheduled to meet with chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer but is not expected not try and woo either for german support of his country ’ s accession to the european union . however , the subject of eu membership is unlikely to remain dormant while erdogan is in germany .
turkey is one of 13 candidates to join the 15-nation eu but , so far , it has been refused a starting date for its membership negotiations because brussels says it has not carried out sufficient reforms to bring its democracy up to western standards .
despite this , germany defended ankara ’ s bid at the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen last december .
fischer makes positive noises in contrast , german foreign minister fischer has recently praised turkish efforts to bring the country into line .
in an interview published on the day when the turkish prime minister is expected , fischer told the business daily handelsblatt newspaper : “ turkey is working seriously and intensively to further open the door to membership of the european union . ”
fischer ’ s words are likely to be the ice breaker at a time when relations between the two countries are certainly frosty .
ties have recently been strained by turkey ’ s decision to strip some of its nationals abroad of their passports for failing to do military service .
the federal government is afraid that the move by its turkish counterpart could leave germany with a number of stateless people of turkish origin who could not be deported even if they committed serious crimes and it has warned turkey the move could harm its eu bid .
kaplan affair could cause discomfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the " caliph of cologne . "
this could also lead to uncomfortable discussions surrounding the fate of metin kaplan , an extremist leader known as the “ caliph of cologne ” who is living in germany and who is wanted by ankara for treason .
turkey has demanded that kaplan be extradited but this move was blocked last week by a german court .
unhappy voices speaking out from ankara about the kaplan affair have already made themselves heard in germany on the day erdogan arrives .
hüseyin diriöz , spokesperson for the turkish foreign ministry , said on monday that the german decision to block ankara ’ s attempts at extradition were “ wrong , unjustified , with prejudices and inadequate assessments of the independent turkish justice system . ”
conservatives oppose eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian governor edmund stoiber .

turkey is one of 13 candidates to join the 15-nation eu but , so far , it has been refused a starting date for its membership negotiations because brussels says it has not carried out sufficient reforms to bring its democracy up to western standards .
despite this , germany defended ankara ’ s bid at the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen last december .
fischer makes positive noises in contrast , german foreign minister fischer has recently praised turkish efforts to bring the country into line .
in an interview published on the day when the turkish prime minister is expected , fischer told the business daily handelsblatt newspaper : “ turkey is working seriously and intensively to further open the door to membership of the european union . ”
fischer ’ s words are likely to be the ice breaker at a time when relations between the two countries are certainly frosty .
ties have recently been strained by turkey ’ s decision to strip some of its nationals abroad of their passports for failing to do military service .
the federal government is afraid that the move by its turkish counterpart could leave germany with a number of stateless people of turkish origin who could not be deported even if they committed serious crimes and it has warned turkey the move could harm its eu bid .
kaplan affair could cause discomfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the " caliph of cologne . "
this could also lead to uncomfortable discussions surrounding the fate of metin kaplan , an extremist leader known as the “ caliph of cologne ” who is living in germany and who is wanted by ankara for treason .
turkey has demanded that kaplan be extradited but this move was blocked last week by a german court .
unhappy voices speaking out from ankara about the kaplan affair have already made themselves heard in germany on the day erdogan arrives .
hüseyin diriöz , spokesperson for the turkish foreign ministry , said on monday that the german decision to block ankara ’ s attempts at extradition were “ wrong , unjustified , with prejudices and inadequate assessments of the independent turkish justice system . ”

but all that could change if the goethe institute ’ s new publicity campaign goes as planned . okay , pop quiz : what ’ s the first thing that comes into your head when you hear the word “ germany ” ?
if you ’ re british , the most popular answers may be adolf hitler , nazis and penalty shoot-outs . given that many britons have a negative view of germany – wars , world cups , towels on beach chairs , etc . – and have little interest in the language and culture , the goethe institute in london has launched a campaign aimed at promoting the learning of german and making the country ’ s image more attractive . the goethe institute , which promotes germany abroad , recently carried out a study in its london branch on the attitudes british people have towards germany and their knowledge about the country and its culture .
the result : there is a severe lack of interest in all things german . history stops at hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : history stops here .
the research showed that britons as a whole suffer from a particularly nasty case of skewed perception thanks to television schedules which tend to be packed with documentaries about the nazis and the holocaust - topics which also make up the majority of the history curriculum regarding germany in british schools .
armed with its new facts , figures and targets , the goethe institute is now fighting back with a publicity campaign which aims to fill mailboxes with postcards featuring übermodel claudia schiffer under the slogan “ learn german - and look good . ”
the campaign will target british students , teachers and cultural institutions .
" we 're very often asked how we intend to change opinions that have been entrenched for generations , " said karl pechatscheck , deputy director at the goethe institute in london in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we say we have to start sometime .
we have to start before future generations take up these ideas .
with more information about germany getting to the uk , the time is right now . "
the new initiative is the first application of ideas formed when staff at the london branch held a brainstorming session in july with corporate and cultural representatives in the hope of coming up with a new " brand " for germany .
" we discovered that it would be too hard to change germany 's brand , as many of the images associated with the country are too deep set , " ulrich sacker , the chairperson of the session , told the marketers , advertising execs and branding professionals gathered at the conference .
accentuate the positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade 2001 in berlin .
“ but we did decide that we 've got to start emphasizing current aspects of german life which are ignored - the hedonism for example of the love parade , the fact that we have short working days , that we take the longest holidays in europe . ”
however , by targeting academics and institutions , the campaign could already be preaching to the more easily convertible .
one might think aiming the program at the average person on the street would do more to change attitudes .
karl pechatscheck has other ideas .
" the campaign is run by our language department , " said pechatscheck , head of the section .
" by targeting schools and teachers , we can help pupils decide to learn german , not the german of hitler but the german of the love parade with new ideas of what germany is . "
the project is reminiscent of the new labour ’ s “ cool britannia ” campaign which sought to overturn widely held stereotypes of the british as uptight , bowler hat-wearing fuddy-duddies .
the campaigns coordinator ’ s insist a change of germany ’ s image would do more than just restore the country ’ s long-suffering pride .
stereotypes of germans held by the british have an impact on tourism , export , business , as well as on investment , according to the office of the german ambassador to london .
agents for change the campaign organizers also hope to start reversing some old war-time attitudes , still entrenched among older generations and even adopted by some younger ones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.09.2003 the eu treads softly in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personally engaged : eu foreign policy head javier solana with yassir arafat european union foreign policy head javier solana is currently visiting the middle east to promote the peace process .
but the eu 's influence there is limited . it was actually the european union which devised the " road map " to peace in the middle east .
the first draft emerged during the danish presidency of the eu in autumn 2002 , according to chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations .
the remaining members of the middle east quartet - the united states , russia and the united nations - accepted and reworked the eu 's plan to create a viable palestinian state and bring an end to terror in the region , patten has said . the united states sees it differently .
at a summit meeting with the israeli and palestinian prime ministers to adopt the road map in early june 2003 , president george w. bush made no mention of the eu .
the united states does n't consider europe an important player in the middle east . too friendly to the palestinians ? the european union , however , has had a special representative for the middle east peace process since 1996 .
in mid-july 2003 belgian diplomat marc otte took over the position . eu high representative for common foreign and security policy javier solana - something like a predecessor to a european foreign minister - is traveling through the region from august 29 to september 3 .
he has been personally engaged in the peace process . but as far as the u.s. and israel are concerned he is too friendly with the palestinians .
solana refuses to break off contacts with palestinian president yassir arafat and only communicate with the palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas , as the u.s. and israel do .
solana also finds it difficult sometimes to curry the support of eu foreign ministers ' for the frustrating peace process with its numerous setbacks . former nato secretary-general solana has written that particularly during times of despair europeans must strengthen their efforts .
the italian presidency of the eu has indicated it would like to bring together the ministers of the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the united states , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- in september .
french president jacques chirac has repeatedly called for europe to speak with one voice in the middle east too .
he has even said he would suggest a second road map to work for peace between israel and syria as well as between israel and lebanon . the eu as financier the eu does n't play a leading role on the political stage , but it does when it comes to financing the palestinian authority and humanitarian aid in the gaza strip and the west bank . according to chris patten , the eu has pumped € 10 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- into the palestinian authority every month since june 2001 just to ensure its continued existence - that is , paying a large part of the salaries of the more than 120,000 employees .
after the second intifada began israel froze the financial flows of tax and customs revenues to the palestinian authority .
the eu filled the gap . the european commission granted the palestinian authority an additional € 100 million in july , € 30 million of which were earmarked just for improving roads .
the peace plans came and went ; the eu continued to pay - more than half a billion euros for direct aid , loans and humanitarian programs in 2002 and 2003 alone . accusations from the media and eu parliamentarians that aid money has been misappropriated by the palestinian authority , headed by yassir arafat , have been dismissed by the accountants in brussels .
numerous independent audits had shown that nothing has gone astray , according to chris patten . aid for israel economic relations with israel are also close .
the eu is israel 's biggest trade partner and since 1995 israel has been part of a special eu program along with all of the mediterranean countries , from which aid money is distributed to israel and its neighbors . despite terror attacks and retaliatory strikes , direct contacts between the israelis and the palestinians continue when it comes to practical issues with the help of the eu .
the eu mediated an agreement between the israeli minister for infrastructure , joseph pritzky , and palestinian energy minister azzam shawwa on joint projects concerning energy supplies . such projects are just what eu high representative solana likes to see .
the spaniard is anxious to help create a climate of trust between the two sides .
in view of the daily violence , he 'll have to have a lot of patience .
solana has said he will report on his recent talks at the eu 's informal meeting of foreign ministers on friday and saturday . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : troubles in africa and the middle east monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa - including elections in rwanda - as well as trouble spots in the middle east .

but all that could change if the goethe institute ’ s new publicity campaign goes as planned . okay , pop quiz : what ’ s the first thing that comes into your head when you hear the word “ germany ” ?
if you ’ re british , the most popular answers may be adolf hitler , nazis and penalty shoot-outs . given that many britons have a negative view of germany – wars , world cups , towels on beach chairs , etc . – and have little interest in the language and culture , the goethe institute in london has launched a campaign aimed at promoting the learning of german and making the country ’ s image more attractive . the goethe institute , which promotes germany abroad , recently carried out a study in its london branch on the attitudes british people have towards germany and their knowledge about the country and its culture .
the result : there is a severe lack of interest in all things german . history stops at hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : history stops here .
the research showed that britons as a whole suffer from a particularly nasty case of skewed perception thanks to television schedules which tend to be packed with documentaries about the nazis and the holocaust - topics which also make up the majority of the history curriculum regarding germany in british schools .
armed with its new facts , figures and targets , the goethe institute is now fighting back with a publicity campaign which aims to fill mailboxes with postcards featuring übermodel claudia schiffer under the slogan “ learn german - and look good . ”
the campaign will target british students , teachers and cultural institutions .
" we 're very often asked how we intend to change opinions that have been entrenched for generations , " said karl pechatscheck , deputy director at the goethe institute in london in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we say we have to start sometime .
we have to start before future generations take up these ideas .
with more information about germany getting to the uk , the time is right now . "
the new initiative is the first application of ideas formed when staff at the london branch held a brainstorming session in july with corporate and cultural representatives in the hope of coming up with a new " brand " for germany .
" we discovered that it would be too hard to change germany 's brand , as many of the images associated with the country are too deep set , " ulrich sacker , the chairperson of the session , told the marketers , advertising execs and branding professionals gathered at the conference .
accentuate the positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade 2001 in berlin .
“ but we did decide that we 've got to start emphasizing current aspects of german life which are ignored - the hedonism for example of the love parade , the fact that we have short working days , that we take the longest holidays in europe . ”
however , by targeting academics and institutions , the campaign could already be preaching to the more easily convertible .
one might think aiming the program at the average person on the street would do more to change attitudes .
karl pechatscheck has other ideas .
" the campaign is run by our language department , " said pechatscheck , head of the section .
" by targeting schools and teachers , we can help pupils decide to learn german , not the german of hitler but the german of the love parade with new ideas of what germany is . "
the project is reminiscent of the new labour ’ s “ cool britannia ” campaign which sought to overturn widely held stereotypes of the british as uptight , bowler hat-wearing fuddy-duddies .
the campaigns coordinator ’ s insist a change of germany ’ s image would do more than just restore the country ’ s long-suffering pride .
stereotypes of germans held by the british have an impact on tourism , export , business , as well as on investment , according to the office of the german ambassador to london .
agents for change the campaign organizers also hope to start reversing some old war-time attitudes , still entrenched among older generations and even adopted by some younger ones .

turkey is one of 13 candidates to join the 15-nation eu but , so far , it has been refused a starting date for its membership negotiations because brussels says it has not carried out sufficient reforms to bring its democracy up to western standards .
despite this , germany defended ankara ’ s bid at the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen last december .
fischer makes positive noises in contrast , german foreign minister fischer has recently praised turkish efforts to bring the country into line .
in an interview published on the day when the turkish prime minister is expected , fischer told the business daily handelsblatt newspaper : “ turkey is working seriously and intensively to further open the door to membership of the european union . ”
fischer ’ s words are likely to be the ice breaker at a time when relations between the two countries are certainly frosty .
ties have recently been strained by turkey ’ s decision to strip some of its nationals abroad of their passports for failing to do military service .
the federal government is afraid that the move by its turkish counterpart could leave germany with a number of stateless people of turkish origin who could not be deported even if they committed serious crimes and it has warned turkey the move could harm its eu bid .
kaplan affair could cause discomfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the " caliph of cologne . "
this could also lead to uncomfortable discussions surrounding the fate of metin kaplan , an extremist leader known as the “ caliph of cologne ” who is living in germany and who is wanted by ankara for treason .
turkey has demanded that kaplan be extradited but this move was blocked last week by a german court .
unhappy voices speaking out from ankara about the kaplan affair have already made themselves heard in germany on the day erdogan arrives .
hüseyin diriöz , spokesperson for the turkish foreign ministry , said on monday that the german decision to block ankara ’ s attempts at extradition were “ wrong , unjustified , with prejudices and inadequate assessments of the independent turkish justice system . ”
conservatives oppose eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian governor edmund stoiber .
turkey is also facing opposition within the german parliament to its eu plans .
germany ’ s conservatives have made it known that they are against the idea of turkey joining the bloc with german help .
edmund stoiber , the premier of the state of bavaria , voiced his party ’ s views during last year ’ s general election , saying “ for us , eu membership for turkey is inconceivable . ” germans opposed to turkey ’ s accession range from those who feel turkey ’ s islamic culture would not fit within that of europe to those concerned about the effect of turkish workers on the ailing labor market .
germany is home to more than two million turks , estimated to be the largest turkish community in western europe and is turkey ’ s most important business partner . reformist association to open in berlin business will certainly be on the agenda in some capacity when erdogan begins his visit proper .
the turkish premier will open the berlin branch of the turkish industrial association , tüsiad , in the capital .
the association has been behind a number of radical reform process ideas in turkey that have been linked with the country ’ s push for eu memebership . it is also likely that erdogan and the germans will discuss the possibility of easing arms export restrictions that have stopped the federal government supplying turkey with battle tanks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish leader hopes berlin will support eu bid turkish prime minister erdogan visits germany on monday , hoping berlin will support ankara ’ s eu bid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.09.2003 the eu treads softly in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personally engaged : eu foreign policy head javier solana with yassir arafat european union foreign policy head javier solana is currently visiting the middle east to promote the peace process .
but the eu 's influence there is limited . it was actually the european union which devised the " road map " to peace in the middle east .
the first draft emerged during the danish presidency of the eu in autumn 2002 , according to chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations .
the remaining members of the middle east quartet - the united states , russia and the united nations - accepted and reworked the eu 's plan to create a viable palestinian state and bring an end to terror in the region , patten has said . the united states sees it differently .
at a summit meeting with the israeli and palestinian prime ministers to adopt the road map in early june 2003 , president george w. bush made no mention of the eu .
the united states does n't consider europe an important player in the middle east . too friendly to the palestinians ? the european union , however , has had a special representative for the middle east peace process since 1996 .
in mid-july 2003 belgian diplomat marc otte took over the position . eu high representative for common foreign and security policy javier solana - something like a predecessor to a european foreign minister - is traveling through the region from august 29 to september 3 .
he has been personally engaged in the peace process . but as far as the u.s. and israel are concerned he is too friendly with the palestinians .
solana refuses to break off contacts with palestinian president yassir arafat and only communicate with the palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas , as the u.s. and israel do .
solana also finds it difficult sometimes to curry the support of eu foreign ministers ' for the frustrating peace process with its numerous setbacks . former nato secretary-general solana has written that particularly during times of despair europeans must strengthen their efforts .
the italian presidency of the eu has indicated it would like to bring together the ministers of the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the united states , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- in september .
french president jacques chirac has repeatedly called for europe to speak with one voice in the middle east too .
he has even said he would suggest a second road map to work for peace between israel and syria as well as between israel and lebanon . the eu as financier the eu does n't play a leading role on the political stage , but it does when it comes to financing the palestinian authority and humanitarian aid in the gaza strip and the west bank . according to chris patten , the eu has pumped € 10 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- into the palestinian authority every month since june 2001 just to ensure its continued existence - that is , paying a large part of the salaries of the more than 120,000 employees .
after the second intifada began israel froze the financial flows of tax and customs revenues to the palestinian authority .
the eu filled the gap . the european commission granted the palestinian authority an additional € 100 million in july , € 30 million of which were earmarked just for improving roads .
the peace plans came and went ; the eu continued to pay - more than half a billion euros for direct aid , loans and humanitarian programs in 2002 and 2003 alone . accusations from the media and eu parliamentarians that aid money has been misappropriated by the palestinian authority , headed by yassir arafat , have been dismissed by the accountants in brussels .
numerous independent audits had shown that nothing has gone astray , according to chris patten . aid for israel economic relations with israel are also close .
the eu is israel 's biggest trade partner and since 1995 israel has been part of a special eu program along with all of the mediterranean countries , from which aid money is distributed to israel and its neighbors . despite terror attacks and retaliatory strikes , direct contacts between the israelis and the palestinians continue when it comes to practical issues with the help of the eu .
the eu mediated an agreement between the israeli minister for infrastructure , joseph pritzky , and palestinian energy minister azzam shawwa on joint projects concerning energy supplies . such projects are just what eu high representative solana likes to see .
the spaniard is anxious to help create a climate of trust between the two sides .
in view of the daily violence , he 'll have to have a lot of patience .
solana has said he will report on his recent talks at the eu 's informal meeting of foreign ministers on friday and saturday . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : troubles in africa and the middle east monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa - including elections in rwanda - as well as trouble spots in the middle east .

turkey is one of 13 candidates to join the 15-nation eu but , so far , it has been refused a starting date for its membership negotiations because brussels says it has not carried out sufficient reforms to bring its democracy up to western standards .
despite this , germany defended ankara ’ s bid at the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen last december .
fischer makes positive noises in contrast , german foreign minister fischer has recently praised turkish efforts to bring the country into line .
in an interview published on the day when the turkish prime minister is expected , fischer told the business daily handelsblatt newspaper : “ turkey is working seriously and intensively to further open the door to membership of the european union . ”
fischer ’ s words are likely to be the ice breaker at a time when relations between the two countries are certainly frosty .
ties have recently been strained by turkey ’ s decision to strip some of its nationals abroad of their passports for failing to do military service .
the federal government is afraid that the move by its turkish counterpart could leave germany with a number of stateless people of turkish origin who could not be deported even if they committed serious crimes and it has warned turkey the move could harm its eu bid .
kaplan affair could cause discomfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the " caliph of cologne . "
this could also lead to uncomfortable discussions surrounding the fate of metin kaplan , an extremist leader known as the “ caliph of cologne ” who is living in germany and who is wanted by ankara for treason .
turkey has demanded that kaplan be extradited but this move was blocked last week by a german court .
unhappy voices speaking out from ankara about the kaplan affair have already made themselves heard in germany on the day erdogan arrives .
hüseyin diriöz , spokesperson for the turkish foreign ministry , said on monday that the german decision to block ankara ’ s attempts at extradition were “ wrong , unjustified , with prejudices and inadequate assessments of the independent turkish justice system . ”
conservatives oppose eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian governor edmund stoiber .
turkey is also facing opposition within the german parliament to its eu plans .
germany ’ s conservatives have made it known that they are against the idea of turkey joining the bloc with german help .
edmund stoiber , the premier of the state of bavaria , voiced his party ’ s views during last year ’ s general election , saying “ for us , eu membership for turkey is inconceivable . ” germans opposed to turkey ’ s accession range from those who feel turkey ’ s islamic culture would not fit within that of europe to those concerned about the effect of turkish workers on the ailing labor market .
germany is home to more than two million turks , estimated to be the largest turkish community in western europe and is turkey ’ s most important business partner . reformist association to open in berlin business will certainly be on the agenda in some capacity when erdogan begins his visit proper .
the turkish premier will open the berlin branch of the turkish industrial association , tüsiad , in the capital .
the association has been behind a number of radical reform process ideas in turkey that have been linked with the country ’ s push for eu memebership . it is also likely that erdogan and the germans will discuss the possibility of easing arms export restrictions that have stopped the federal government supplying turkey with battle tanks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish leader hopes berlin will support eu bid turkish prime minister erdogan visits germany on monday , hoping berlin will support ankara ’ s eu bid .
but germany remains split even as media reports say it could ease arms export restrictions to turkey .
-lrb- august 31 , 2003 -rrb- turkey pushes forward on eu reform course in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership .
-lrb- august 6 , 2003 -rrb- germany still wary of turkey 's eu aspirations turkish president ahmet sezer is in berlin to rally support for eu membership .
but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold .

but the eu 's influence there is limited . it was actually the european union which devised the " road map " to peace in the middle east .
the first draft emerged during the danish presidency of the eu in autumn 2002 , according to chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations .
the remaining members of the middle east quartet - the united states , russia and the united nations - accepted and reworked the eu 's plan to create a viable palestinian state and bring an end to terror in the region , patten has said . the united states sees it differently .
at a summit meeting with the israeli and palestinian prime ministers to adopt the road map in early june 2003 , president george w. bush made no mention of the eu .
the united states does n't consider europe an important player in the middle east . too friendly to the palestinians ? the european union , however , has had a special representative for the middle east peace process since 1996 .
in mid-july 2003 belgian diplomat marc otte took over the position . eu high representative for common foreign and security policy javier solana - something like a predecessor to a european foreign minister - is traveling through the region from august 29 to september 3 .
he has been personally engaged in the peace process . but as far as the u.s. and israel are concerned he is too friendly with the palestinians .
solana refuses to break off contacts with palestinian president yassir arafat and only communicate with the palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas , as the u.s. and israel do .
solana also finds it difficult sometimes to curry the support of eu foreign ministers ' for the frustrating peace process with its numerous setbacks . former nato secretary-general solana has written that particularly during times of despair europeans must strengthen their efforts .
the italian presidency of the eu has indicated it would like to bring together the ministers of the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the united states , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- in september .
french president jacques chirac has repeatedly called for europe to speak with one voice in the middle east too .
he has even said he would suggest a second road map to work for peace between israel and syria as well as between israel and lebanon . the eu as financier the eu does n't play a leading role on the political stage , but it does when it comes to financing the palestinian authority and humanitarian aid in the gaza strip and the west bank . according to chris patten , the eu has pumped € 10 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- into the palestinian authority every month since june 2001 just to ensure its continued existence - that is , paying a large part of the salaries of the more than 120,000 employees .
after the second intifada began israel froze the financial flows of tax and customs revenues to the palestinian authority .
the eu filled the gap . the european commission granted the palestinian authority an additional € 100 million in july , € 30 million of which were earmarked just for improving roads .
the peace plans came and went ; the eu continued to pay - more than half a billion euros for direct aid , loans and humanitarian programs in 2002 and 2003 alone . accusations from the media and eu parliamentarians that aid money has been misappropriated by the palestinian authority , headed by yassir arafat , have been dismissed by the accountants in brussels .
numerous independent audits had shown that nothing has gone astray , according to chris patten . aid for israel economic relations with israel are also close .
the eu is israel 's biggest trade partner and since 1995 israel has been part of a special eu program along with all of the mediterranean countries , from which aid money is distributed to israel and its neighbors . despite terror attacks and retaliatory strikes , direct contacts between the israelis and the palestinians continue when it comes to practical issues with the help of the eu .
the eu mediated an agreement between the israeli minister for infrastructure , joseph pritzky , and palestinian energy minister azzam shawwa on joint projects concerning energy supplies . such projects are just what eu high representative solana likes to see .

if you ’ re british , the most popular answers may be adolf hitler , nazis and penalty shoot-outs . given that many britons have a negative view of germany – wars , world cups , towels on beach chairs , etc . – and have little interest in the language and culture , the goethe institute in london has launched a campaign aimed at promoting the learning of german and making the country ’ s image more attractive . the goethe institute , which promotes germany abroad , recently carried out a study in its london branch on the attitudes british people have towards germany and their knowledge about the country and its culture .

" by targeting schools and teachers , we can help pupils decide to learn german , not the german of hitler but the german of the love parade with new ideas of what germany is . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.09.2003 the eu treads softly in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personally engaged : eu foreign policy head javier solana with yassir arafat european union foreign policy head javier solana is currently visiting the middle east to promote the peace process .
but the eu 's influence there is limited . it was actually the european union which devised the " road map " to peace in the middle east .
the first draft emerged during the danish presidency of the eu in autumn 2002 , according to chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations .
the remaining members of the middle east quartet - the united states , russia and the united nations - accepted and reworked the eu 's plan to create a viable palestinian state and bring an end to terror in the region , patten has said . the united states sees it differently .
at a summit meeting with the israeli and palestinian prime ministers to adopt the road map in early june 2003 , president george w. bush made no mention of the eu .
the united states does n't consider europe an important player in the middle east . too friendly to the palestinians ? the european union , however , has had a special representative for the middle east peace process since 1996 .
in mid-july 2003 belgian diplomat marc otte took over the position . eu high representative for common foreign and security policy javier solana - something like a predecessor to a european foreign minister - is traveling through the region from august 29 to september 3 .
he has been personally engaged in the peace process . but as far as the u.s. and israel are concerned he is too friendly with the palestinians .
solana refuses to break off contacts with palestinian president yassir arafat and only communicate with the palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas , as the u.s. and israel do .
solana also finds it difficult sometimes to curry the support of eu foreign ministers ' for the frustrating peace process with its numerous setbacks . former nato secretary-general solana has written that particularly during times of despair europeans must strengthen their efforts .
the italian presidency of the eu has indicated it would like to bring together the ministers of the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the united states , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- in september .
french president jacques chirac has repeatedly called for europe to speak with one voice in the middle east too .
he has even said he would suggest a second road map to work for peace between israel and syria as well as between israel and lebanon . the eu as financier the eu does n't play a leading role on the political stage , but it does when it comes to financing the palestinian authority and humanitarian aid in the gaza strip and the west bank . according to chris patten , the eu has pumped € 10 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- into the palestinian authority every month since june 2001 just to ensure its continued existence - that is , paying a large part of the salaries of the more than 120,000 employees .
after the second intifada began israel froze the financial flows of tax and customs revenues to the palestinian authority .
the eu filled the gap . the european commission granted the palestinian authority an additional € 100 million in july , € 30 million of which were earmarked just for improving roads .
the peace plans came and went ; the eu continued to pay - more than half a billion euros for direct aid , loans and humanitarian programs in 2002 and 2003 alone . accusations from the media and eu parliamentarians that aid money has been misappropriated by the palestinian authority , headed by yassir arafat , have been dismissed by the accountants in brussels .
numerous independent audits had shown that nothing has gone astray , according to chris patten . aid for israel economic relations with israel are also close .
the eu is israel 's biggest trade partner and since 1995 israel has been part of a special eu program along with all of the mediterranean countries , from which aid money is distributed to israel and its neighbors . despite terror attacks and retaliatory strikes , direct contacts between the israelis and the palestinians continue when it comes to practical issues with the help of the eu .
the eu mediated an agreement between the israeli minister for infrastructure , joseph pritzky , and palestinian energy minister azzam shawwa on joint projects concerning energy supplies . such projects are just what eu high representative solana likes to see .
the spaniard is anxious to help create a climate of trust between the two sides .
in view of the daily violence , he 'll have to have a lot of patience .
solana has said he will report on his recent talks at the eu 's informal meeting of foreign ministers on friday and saturday . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : troubles in africa and the middle east monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa - including elections in rwanda - as well as trouble spots in the middle east .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.09.2003 german-turkish relations scrutinized on eve of erdogan visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister erdogan will arrive in berlin with a busy agenda turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan arrives in germany on monday night for a visit that promises to be full of difficult discussions with german leaders . while in the capital for his first official visit , erdogan is scheduled to meet with chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer but is not expected not try and woo either for german support of his country ’ s accession to the european union . however , the subject of eu membership is unlikely to remain dormant while erdogan is in germany .
turkey is one of 13 candidates to join the 15-nation eu but , so far , it has been refused a starting date for its membership negotiations because brussels says it has not carried out sufficient reforms to bring its democracy up to western standards .
despite this , germany defended ankara ’ s bid at the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen last december .
fischer makes positive noises in contrast , german foreign minister fischer has recently praised turkish efforts to bring the country into line .
in an interview published on the day when the turkish prime minister is expected , fischer told the business daily handelsblatt newspaper : “ turkey is working seriously and intensively to further open the door to membership of the european union . ”
fischer ’ s words are likely to be the ice breaker at a time when relations between the two countries are certainly frosty .
ties have recently been strained by turkey ’ s decision to strip some of its nationals abroad of their passports for failing to do military service .
the federal government is afraid that the move by its turkish counterpart could leave germany with a number of stateless people of turkish origin who could not be deported even if they committed serious crimes and it has warned turkey the move could harm its eu bid .
kaplan affair could cause discomfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the " caliph of cologne . "
this could also lead to uncomfortable discussions surrounding the fate of metin kaplan , an extremist leader known as the “ caliph of cologne ” who is living in germany and who is wanted by ankara for treason .
turkey has demanded that kaplan be extradited but this move was blocked last week by a german court .
unhappy voices speaking out from ankara about the kaplan affair have already made themselves heard in germany on the day erdogan arrives .
hüseyin diriöz , spokesperson for the turkish foreign ministry , said on monday that the german decision to block ankara ’ s attempts at extradition were “ wrong , unjustified , with prejudices and inadequate assessments of the independent turkish justice system . ”
conservatives oppose eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian governor edmund stoiber .
turkey is also facing opposition within the german parliament to its eu plans .
germany ’ s conservatives have made it known that they are against the idea of turkey joining the bloc with german help .
edmund stoiber , the premier of the state of bavaria , voiced his party ’ s views during last year ’ s general election , saying “ for us , eu membership for turkey is inconceivable . ” germans opposed to turkey ’ s accession range from those who feel turkey ’ s islamic culture would not fit within that of europe to those concerned about the effect of turkish workers on the ailing labor market .
germany is home to more than two million turks , estimated to be the largest turkish community in western europe and is turkey ’ s most important business partner . reformist association to open in berlin business will certainly be on the agenda in some capacity when erdogan begins his visit proper .
the turkish premier will open the berlin branch of the turkish industrial association , tüsiad , in the capital .
the association has been behind a number of radical reform process ideas in turkey that have been linked with the country ’ s push for eu memebership . it is also likely that erdogan and the germans will discuss the possibility of easing arms export restrictions that have stopped the federal government supplying turkey with battle tanks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish leader hopes berlin will support eu bid turkish prime minister erdogan visits germany on monday , hoping berlin will support ankara ’ s eu bid .
but germany remains split even as media reports say it could ease arms export restrictions to turkey .
-lrb- august 31 , 2003 -rrb- turkey pushes forward on eu reform course in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership .
-lrb- august 6 , 2003 -rrb- germany still wary of turkey 's eu aspirations turkish president ahmet sezer is in berlin to rally support for eu membership .
but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold .

if you ’ re british , the most popular answers may be adolf hitler , nazis and penalty shoot-outs . given that many britons have a negative view of germany – wars , world cups , towels on beach chairs , etc . – and have little interest in the language and culture , the goethe institute in london has launched a campaign aimed at promoting the learning of german and making the country ’ s image more attractive . the goethe institute , which promotes germany abroad , recently carried out a study in its london branch on the attitudes british people have towards germany and their knowledge about the country and its culture .
the result : there is a severe lack of interest in all things german . history stops at hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : history stops here .

the company , deutsche system lotto gmbh , convinced an estimated 8,000 individuals throughout germany to enter into contracts that guaranteed a payout of up to € 125,000 -lrb- $ 137,000 -rrb- if they did not win a ‘ fiver ’ or ‘ sixer ’ lottery draw within a year .

turkey is one of 13 candidates to join the 15-nation eu but , so far , it has been refused a starting date for its membership negotiations because brussels says it has not carried out sufficient reforms to bring its democracy up to western standards .
despite this , germany defended ankara ’ s bid at the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen last december .
fischer makes positive noises in contrast , german foreign minister fischer has recently praised turkish efforts to bring the country into line .
in an interview published on the day when the turkish prime minister is expected , fischer told the business daily handelsblatt newspaper : “ turkey is working seriously and intensively to further open the door to membership of the european union . ”
fischer ’ s words are likely to be the ice breaker at a time when relations between the two countries are certainly frosty .
ties have recently been strained by turkey ’ s decision to strip some of its nationals abroad of their passports for failing to do military service .
the federal government is afraid that the move by its turkish counterpart could leave germany with a number of stateless people of turkish origin who could not be deported even if they committed serious crimes and it has warned turkey the move could harm its eu bid .
kaplan affair could cause discomfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the " caliph of cologne . "
this could also lead to uncomfortable discussions surrounding the fate of metin kaplan , an extremist leader known as the “ caliph of cologne ” who is living in germany and who is wanted by ankara for treason .
turkey has demanded that kaplan be extradited but this move was blocked last week by a german court .
unhappy voices speaking out from ankara about the kaplan affair have already made themselves heard in germany on the day erdogan arrives .
hüseyin diriöz , spokesperson for the turkish foreign ministry , said on monday that the german decision to block ankara ’ s attempts at extradition were “ wrong , unjustified , with prejudices and inadequate assessments of the independent turkish justice system . ”
conservatives oppose eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian governor edmund stoiber .
turkey is also facing opposition within the german parliament to its eu plans .
germany ’ s conservatives have made it known that they are against the idea of turkey joining the bloc with german help .
edmund stoiber , the premier of the state of bavaria , voiced his party ’ s views during last year ’ s general election , saying “ for us , eu membership for turkey is inconceivable . ” germans opposed to turkey ’ s accession range from those who feel turkey ’ s islamic culture would not fit within that of europe to those concerned about the effect of turkish workers on the ailing labor market .
germany is home to more than two million turks , estimated to be the largest turkish community in western europe and is turkey ’ s most important business partner . reformist association to open in berlin business will certainly be on the agenda in some capacity when erdogan begins his visit proper .
the turkish premier will open the berlin branch of the turkish industrial association , tüsiad , in the capital .

ernst welteke told reporters during a trip to moscow that persistent weakness in the german economy meant the country will not be able to reduce its public deficit below three percent of gdp in 2004 .
germany already missed the limit in 2002 and 2003 .
the three percent rule , part of the eu stability and growth pact , was put in place to protect the euro .
the german government hopes to haul the economy out of recession by loosening restrictive labor laws and by pulling a tax cut planned for 2005 forward a year .
chancellor gerhard schröder is counting on the economy to grow by 2 percent in 2004 in order to meet the deficit limit .
however , many economists do not consider the aim achievable .
the eu commission has warned germany it faces fiscal sanctions if it breaks the deficit rule for a third time . more briefs 01.09.2003 -pipe- regulator against merger of berlin dailies 01.09.2003 -pipe- fifa to issue bond for world cup coverage 01.09.2003 -pipe- east german companies buck trend 29.08.2003 -pipe- german retailer equates gay partnerships with marriage 29.08.2003 -pipe- german retail sales fall again 28.08.2003 -pipe- no pale imitations : liebfrauenmilch joins exclusive name list 28.08.2003 -pipe- tui suffers from travel slump 28.08.2003 -pipe- munich reinsurer reels over downgrade , loss radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 01.09.2003 the eu treads softly in the middle east großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : personally engaged : eu foreign policy head javier solana with yassir arafat european union foreign policy head javier solana is currently visiting the middle east to promote the peace process .
but the eu 's influence there is limited . it was actually the european union which devised the " road map " to peace in the middle east .
the first draft emerged during the danish presidency of the eu in autumn 2002 , according to chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations .
the remaining members of the middle east quartet - the united states , russia and the united nations - accepted and reworked the eu 's plan to create a viable palestinian state and bring an end to terror in the region , patten has said . the united states sees it differently .
at a summit meeting with the israeli and palestinian prime ministers to adopt the road map in early june 2003 , president george w. bush made no mention of the eu .
the united states does n't consider europe an important player in the middle east . too friendly to the palestinians ? the european union , however , has had a special representative for the middle east peace process since 1996 .
in mid-july 2003 belgian diplomat marc otte took over the position . eu high representative for common foreign and security policy javier solana - something like a predecessor to a european foreign minister - is traveling through the region from august 29 to september 3 .
he has been personally engaged in the peace process . but as far as the u.s. and israel are concerned he is too friendly with the palestinians .
solana refuses to break off contacts with palestinian president yassir arafat and only communicate with the palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas , as the u.s. and israel do .
solana also finds it difficult sometimes to curry the support of eu foreign ministers ' for the frustrating peace process with its numerous setbacks . former nato secretary-general solana has written that particularly during times of despair europeans must strengthen their efforts .
the italian presidency of the eu has indicated it would like to bring together the ministers of the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the united states , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- in september .
french president jacques chirac has repeatedly called for europe to speak with one voice in the middle east too .
he has even said he would suggest a second road map to work for peace between israel and syria as well as between israel and lebanon . the eu as financier the eu does n't play a leading role on the political stage , but it does when it comes to financing the palestinian authority and humanitarian aid in the gaza strip and the west bank . according to chris patten , the eu has pumped € 10 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- into the palestinian authority every month since june 2001 just to ensure its continued existence - that is , paying a large part of the salaries of the more than 120,000 employees .
after the second intifada began israel froze the financial flows of tax and customs revenues to the palestinian authority .
the eu filled the gap . the european commission granted the palestinian authority an additional € 100 million in july , € 30 million of which were earmarked just for improving roads .
the peace plans came and went ; the eu continued to pay - more than half a billion euros for direct aid , loans and humanitarian programs in 2002 and 2003 alone . accusations from the media and eu parliamentarians that aid money has been misappropriated by the palestinian authority , headed by yassir arafat , have been dismissed by the accountants in brussels .
numerous independent audits had shown that nothing has gone astray , according to chris patten . aid for israel economic relations with israel are also close .
the eu is israel 's biggest trade partner and since 1995 israel has been part of a special eu program along with all of the mediterranean countries , from which aid money is distributed to israel and its neighbors . despite terror attacks and retaliatory strikes , direct contacts between the israelis and the palestinians continue when it comes to practical issues with the help of the eu .
the eu mediated an agreement between the israeli minister for infrastructure , joseph pritzky , and palestinian energy minister azzam shawwa on joint projects concerning energy supplies . such projects are just what eu high representative solana likes to see .
the spaniard is anxious to help create a climate of trust between the two sides .
in view of the daily violence , he 'll have to have a lot of patience .

but all that could change if the goethe institute ’ s new publicity campaign goes as planned . okay , pop quiz : what ’ s the first thing that comes into your head when you hear the word “ germany ” ?
if you ’ re british , the most popular answers may be adolf hitler , nazis and penalty shoot-outs . given that many britons have a negative view of germany – wars , world cups , towels on beach chairs , etc . – and have little interest in the language and culture , the goethe institute in london has launched a campaign aimed at promoting the learning of german and making the country ’ s image more attractive . the goethe institute , which promotes germany abroad , recently carried out a study in its london branch on the attitudes british people have towards germany and their knowledge about the country and its culture .
the result : there is a severe lack of interest in all things german . history stops at hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : history stops here .
the research showed that britons as a whole suffer from a particularly nasty case of skewed perception thanks to television schedules which tend to be packed with documentaries about the nazis and the holocaust - topics which also make up the majority of the history curriculum regarding germany in british schools .
armed with its new facts , figures and targets , the goethe institute is now fighting back with a publicity campaign which aims to fill mailboxes with postcards featuring übermodel claudia schiffer under the slogan “ learn german - and look good . ”
the campaign will target british students , teachers and cultural institutions .
" we 're very often asked how we intend to change opinions that have been entrenched for generations , " said karl pechatscheck , deputy director at the goethe institute in london in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we say we have to start sometime .
we have to start before future generations take up these ideas .
with more information about germany getting to the uk , the time is right now . "
the new initiative is the first application of ideas formed when staff at the london branch held a brainstorming session in july with corporate and cultural representatives in the hope of coming up with a new " brand " for germany .
" we discovered that it would be too hard to change germany 's brand , as many of the images associated with the country are too deep set , " ulrich sacker , the chairperson of the session , told the marketers , advertising execs and branding professionals gathered at the conference .
accentuate the positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade 2001 in berlin .
“ but we did decide that we 've got to start emphasizing current aspects of german life which are ignored - the hedonism for example of the love parade , the fact that we have short working days , that we take the longest holidays in europe . ”
however , by targeting academics and institutions , the campaign could already be preaching to the more easily convertible .
one might think aiming the program at the average person on the street would do more to change attitudes .
karl pechatscheck has other ideas .
" the campaign is run by our language department , " said pechatscheck , head of the section .
" by targeting schools and teachers , we can help pupils decide to learn german , not the german of hitler but the german of the love parade with new ideas of what germany is . "
the project is reminiscent of the new labour ’ s “ cool britannia ” campaign which sought to overturn widely held stereotypes of the british as uptight , bowler hat-wearing fuddy-duddies .
the campaigns coordinator ’ s insist a change of germany ’ s image would do more than just restore the country ’ s long-suffering pride .
stereotypes of germans held by the british have an impact on tourism , export , business , as well as on investment , according to the office of the german ambassador to london .
agents for change the campaign organizers also hope to start reversing some old war-time attitudes , still entrenched among older generations and even adopted by some younger ones .

but all that could change if the goethe institute ’ s new publicity campaign goes as planned . okay , pop quiz : what ’ s the first thing that comes into your head when you hear the word “ germany ” ?
if you ’ re british , the most popular answers may be adolf hitler , nazis and penalty shoot-outs . given that many britons have a negative view of germany – wars , world cups , towels on beach chairs , etc . – and have little interest in the language and culture , the goethe institute in london has launched a campaign aimed at promoting the learning of german and making the country ’ s image more attractive . the goethe institute , which promotes germany abroad , recently carried out a study in its london branch on the attitudes british people have towards germany and their knowledge about the country and its culture .
the result : there is a severe lack of interest in all things german . history stops at hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : history stops here .
the research showed that britons as a whole suffer from a particularly nasty case of skewed perception thanks to television schedules which tend to be packed with documentaries about the nazis and the holocaust - topics which also make up the majority of the history curriculum regarding germany in british schools .
armed with its new facts , figures and targets , the goethe institute is now fighting back with a publicity campaign which aims to fill mailboxes with postcards featuring übermodel claudia schiffer under the slogan “ learn german - and look good . ”
the campaign will target british students , teachers and cultural institutions .
" we 're very often asked how we intend to change opinions that have been entrenched for generations , " said karl pechatscheck , deputy director at the goethe institute in london in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we say we have to start sometime .
we have to start before future generations take up these ideas .
with more information about germany getting to the uk , the time is right now . "
the new initiative is the first application of ideas formed when staff at the london branch held a brainstorming session in july with corporate and cultural representatives in the hope of coming up with a new " brand " for germany .
" we discovered that it would be too hard to change germany 's brand , as many of the images associated with the country are too deep set , " ulrich sacker , the chairperson of the session , told the marketers , advertising execs and branding professionals gathered at the conference .
accentuate the positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade 2001 in berlin .
“ but we did decide that we 've got to start emphasizing current aspects of german life which are ignored - the hedonism for example of the love parade , the fact that we have short working days , that we take the longest holidays in europe . ”
however , by targeting academics and institutions , the campaign could already be preaching to the more easily convertible .
one might think aiming the program at the average person on the street would do more to change attitudes .
karl pechatscheck has other ideas .
" the campaign is run by our language department , " said pechatscheck , head of the section .
" by targeting schools and teachers , we can help pupils decide to learn german , not the german of hitler but the german of the love parade with new ideas of what germany is . "
the project is reminiscent of the new labour ’ s “ cool britannia ” campaign which sought to overturn widely held stereotypes of the british as uptight , bowler hat-wearing fuddy-duddies .
the campaigns coordinator ’ s insist a change of germany ’ s image would do more than just restore the country ’ s long-suffering pride .
stereotypes of germans held by the british have an impact on tourism , export , business , as well as on investment , according to the office of the german ambassador to london .
agents for change the campaign organizers also hope to start reversing some old war-time attitudes , still entrenched among older generations and even adopted by some younger ones .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.09.2003 german-turkish relations scrutinized on eve of erdogan visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister erdogan will arrive in berlin with a busy agenda turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan arrives in germany on monday night for a visit that promises to be full of difficult discussions with german leaders . while in the capital for his first official visit , erdogan is scheduled to meet with chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer but is not expected not try and woo either for german support of his country ’ s accession to the european union . however , the subject of eu membership is unlikely to remain dormant while erdogan is in germany .
turkey is one of 13 candidates to join the 15-nation eu but , so far , it has been refused a starting date for its membership negotiations because brussels says it has not carried out sufficient reforms to bring its democracy up to western standards .
despite this , germany defended ankara ’ s bid at the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen last december .
fischer makes positive noises in contrast , german foreign minister fischer has recently praised turkish efforts to bring the country into line .
in an interview published on the day when the turkish prime minister is expected , fischer told the business daily handelsblatt newspaper : “ turkey is working seriously and intensively to further open the door to membership of the european union . ”
fischer ’ s words are likely to be the ice breaker at a time when relations between the two countries are certainly frosty .
ties have recently been strained by turkey ’ s decision to strip some of its nationals abroad of their passports for failing to do military service .
the federal government is afraid that the move by its turkish counterpart could leave germany with a number of stateless people of turkish origin who could not be deported even if they committed serious crimes and it has warned turkey the move could harm its eu bid .
kaplan affair could cause discomfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the " caliph of cologne . "
this could also lead to uncomfortable discussions surrounding the fate of metin kaplan , an extremist leader known as the “ caliph of cologne ” who is living in germany and who is wanted by ankara for treason .
turkey has demanded that kaplan be extradited but this move was blocked last week by a german court .
unhappy voices speaking out from ankara about the kaplan affair have already made themselves heard in germany on the day erdogan arrives .
hüseyin diriöz , spokesperson for the turkish foreign ministry , said on monday that the german decision to block ankara ’ s attempts at extradition were “ wrong , unjustified , with prejudices and inadequate assessments of the independent turkish justice system . ”
conservatives oppose eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian governor edmund stoiber .
turkey is also facing opposition within the german parliament to its eu plans .
germany ’ s conservatives have made it known that they are against the idea of turkey joining the bloc with german help .
edmund stoiber , the premier of the state of bavaria , voiced his party ’ s views during last year ’ s general election , saying “ for us , eu membership for turkey is inconceivable . ” germans opposed to turkey ’ s accession range from those who feel turkey ’ s islamic culture would not fit within that of europe to those concerned about the effect of turkish workers on the ailing labor market .
germany is home to more than two million turks , estimated to be the largest turkish community in western europe and is turkey ’ s most important business partner . reformist association to open in berlin business will certainly be on the agenda in some capacity when erdogan begins his visit proper .
the turkish premier will open the berlin branch of the turkish industrial association , tüsiad , in the capital .
the association has been behind a number of radical reform process ideas in turkey that have been linked with the country ’ s push for eu memebership . it is also likely that erdogan and the germans will discuss the possibility of easing arms export restrictions that have stopped the federal government supplying turkey with battle tanks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish leader hopes berlin will support eu bid turkish prime minister erdogan visits germany on monday , hoping berlin will support ankara ’ s eu bid .
but germany remains split even as media reports say it could ease arms export restrictions to turkey .
-lrb- august 31 , 2003 -rrb- turkey pushes forward on eu reform course in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership .
-lrb- august 6 , 2003 -rrb- germany still wary of turkey 's eu aspirations turkish president ahmet sezer is in berlin to rally support for eu membership .
but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold .

but the eu 's influence there is limited . it was actually the european union which devised the " road map " to peace in the middle east .
the first draft emerged during the danish presidency of the eu in autumn 2002 , according to chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations .
the remaining members of the middle east quartet - the united states , russia and the united nations - accepted and reworked the eu 's plan to create a viable palestinian state and bring an end to terror in the region , patten has said . the united states sees it differently .
at a summit meeting with the israeli and palestinian prime ministers to adopt the road map in early june 2003 , president george w. bush made no mention of the eu .
the united states does n't consider europe an important player in the middle east . too friendly to the palestinians ? the european union , however , has had a special representative for the middle east peace process since 1996 .
in mid-july 2003 belgian diplomat marc otte took over the position . eu high representative for common foreign and security policy javier solana - something like a predecessor to a european foreign minister - is traveling through the region from august 29 to september 3 .
he has been personally engaged in the peace process . but as far as the u.s. and israel are concerned he is too friendly with the palestinians .
solana refuses to break off contacts with palestinian president yassir arafat and only communicate with the palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas , as the u.s. and israel do .
solana also finds it difficult sometimes to curry the support of eu foreign ministers ' for the frustrating peace process with its numerous setbacks . former nato secretary-general solana has written that particularly during times of despair europeans must strengthen their efforts .
the italian presidency of the eu has indicated it would like to bring together the ministers of the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the united states , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- in september .
french president jacques chirac has repeatedly called for europe to speak with one voice in the middle east too .
he has even said he would suggest a second road map to work for peace between israel and syria as well as between israel and lebanon . the eu as financier the eu does n't play a leading role on the political stage , but it does when it comes to financing the palestinian authority and humanitarian aid in the gaza strip and the west bank . according to chris patten , the eu has pumped € 10 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- into the palestinian authority every month since june 2001 just to ensure its continued existence - that is , paying a large part of the salaries of the more than 120,000 employees .
after the second intifada began israel froze the financial flows of tax and customs revenues to the palestinian authority .
the eu filled the gap . the european commission granted the palestinian authority an additional € 100 million in july , € 30 million of which were earmarked just for improving roads .
the peace plans came and went ; the eu continued to pay - more than half a billion euros for direct aid , loans and humanitarian programs in 2002 and 2003 alone . accusations from the media and eu parliamentarians that aid money has been misappropriated by the palestinian authority , headed by yassir arafat , have been dismissed by the accountants in brussels .
numerous independent audits had shown that nothing has gone astray , according to chris patten . aid for israel economic relations with israel are also close .
the eu is israel 's biggest trade partner and since 1995 israel has been part of a special eu program along with all of the mediterranean countries , from which aid money is distributed to israel and its neighbors . despite terror attacks and retaliatory strikes , direct contacts between the israelis and the palestinians continue when it comes to practical issues with the help of the eu .
the eu mediated an agreement between the israeli minister for infrastructure , joseph pritzky , and palestinian energy minister azzam shawwa on joint projects concerning energy supplies . such projects are just what eu high representative solana likes to see .
the spaniard is anxious to help create a climate of trust between the two sides .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.09.2003 german-turkish relations scrutinized on eve of erdogan visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister erdogan will arrive in berlin with a busy agenda turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan arrives in germany on monday night for a visit that promises to be full of difficult discussions with german leaders . while in the capital for his first official visit , erdogan is scheduled to meet with chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer but is not expected not try and woo either for german support of his country ’ s accession to the european union . however , the subject of eu membership is unlikely to remain dormant while erdogan is in germany .
turkey is one of 13 candidates to join the 15-nation eu but , so far , it has been refused a starting date for its membership negotiations because brussels says it has not carried out sufficient reforms to bring its democracy up to western standards .
despite this , germany defended ankara ’ s bid at the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen last december .
fischer makes positive noises in contrast , german foreign minister fischer has recently praised turkish efforts to bring the country into line .
in an interview published on the day when the turkish prime minister is expected , fischer told the business daily handelsblatt newspaper : “ turkey is working seriously and intensively to further open the door to membership of the european union . ”
fischer ’ s words are likely to be the ice breaker at a time when relations between the two countries are certainly frosty .
ties have recently been strained by turkey ’ s decision to strip some of its nationals abroad of their passports for failing to do military service .
the federal government is afraid that the move by its turkish counterpart could leave germany with a number of stateless people of turkish origin who could not be deported even if they committed serious crimes and it has warned turkey the move could harm its eu bid .
kaplan affair could cause discomfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the " caliph of cologne . "
this could also lead to uncomfortable discussions surrounding the fate of metin kaplan , an extremist leader known as the “ caliph of cologne ” who is living in germany and who is wanted by ankara for treason .
turkey has demanded that kaplan be extradited but this move was blocked last week by a german court .
unhappy voices speaking out from ankara about the kaplan affair have already made themselves heard in germany on the day erdogan arrives .
hüseyin diriöz , spokesperson for the turkish foreign ministry , said on monday that the german decision to block ankara ’ s attempts at extradition were “ wrong , unjustified , with prejudices and inadequate assessments of the independent turkish justice system . ”
conservatives oppose eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian governor edmund stoiber .
turkey is also facing opposition within the german parliament to its eu plans .
germany ’ s conservatives have made it known that they are against the idea of turkey joining the bloc with german help .
edmund stoiber , the premier of the state of bavaria , voiced his party ’ s views during last year ’ s general election , saying “ for us , eu membership for turkey is inconceivable . ” germans opposed to turkey ’ s accession range from those who feel turkey ’ s islamic culture would not fit within that of europe to those concerned about the effect of turkish workers on the ailing labor market .
germany is home to more than two million turks , estimated to be the largest turkish community in western europe and is turkey ’ s most important business partner . reformist association to open in berlin business will certainly be on the agenda in some capacity when erdogan begins his visit proper .
the turkish premier will open the berlin branch of the turkish industrial association , tüsiad , in the capital .
the association has been behind a number of radical reform process ideas in turkey that have been linked with the country ’ s push for eu memebership . it is also likely that erdogan and the germans will discuss the possibility of easing arms export restrictions that have stopped the federal government supplying turkey with battle tanks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish leader hopes berlin will support eu bid turkish prime minister erdogan visits germany on monday , hoping berlin will support ankara ’ s eu bid .
but germany remains split even as media reports say it could ease arms export restrictions to turkey .
-lrb- august 31 , 2003 -rrb- turkey pushes forward on eu reform course in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership .
-lrb- august 6 , 2003 -rrb- germany still wary of turkey 's eu aspirations turkish president ahmet sezer is in berlin to rally support for eu membership .
but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold .

unhappy voices speaking out from ankara about the kaplan affair have already made themselves heard in germany on the day erdogan arrives .
hüseyin diriöz , spokesperson for the turkish foreign ministry , said on monday that the german decision to block ankara ’ s attempts at extradition were “ wrong , unjustified , with prejudices and inadequate assessments of the independent turkish justice system . ”
conservatives oppose eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian governor edmund stoiber .
turkey is also facing opposition within the german parliament to its eu plans .
germany ’ s conservatives have made it known that they are against the idea of turkey joining the bloc with german help .
edmund stoiber , the premier of the state of bavaria , voiced his party ’ s views during last year ’ s general election , saying “ for us , eu membership for turkey is inconceivable . ” germans opposed to turkey ’ s accession range from those who feel turkey ’ s islamic culture would not fit within that of europe to those concerned about the effect of turkish workers on the ailing labor market .
germany is home to more than two million turks , estimated to be the largest turkish community in western europe and is turkey ’ s most important business partner . reformist association to open in berlin business will certainly be on the agenda in some capacity when erdogan begins his visit proper .
the turkish premier will open the berlin branch of the turkish industrial association , tüsiad , in the capital .
the association has been behind a number of radical reform process ideas in turkey that have been linked with the country ’ s push for eu memebership . it is also likely that erdogan and the germans will discuss the possibility of easing arms export restrictions that have stopped the federal government supplying turkey with battle tanks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish leader hopes berlin will support eu bid turkish prime minister erdogan visits germany on monday , hoping berlin will support ankara ’ s eu bid .
but germany remains split even as media reports say it could ease arms export restrictions to turkey .
-lrb- august 31 , 2003 -rrb- turkey pushes forward on eu reform course in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .
it ’ s the latest in a slew of reforms aimed to qualify the country for eu membership .
-lrb- august 6 , 2003 -rrb- germany still wary of turkey 's eu aspirations turkish president ahmet sezer is in berlin to rally support for eu membership .
but germany ’ s main political parties are still split over whether a predominantly muslim nation should be admitted into the european fold .

but the eu 's influence there is limited . it was actually the european union which devised the " road map " to peace in the middle east .
the first draft emerged during the danish presidency of the eu in autumn 2002 , according to chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations .
the remaining members of the middle east quartet - the united states , russia and the united nations - accepted and reworked the eu 's plan to create a viable palestinian state and bring an end to terror in the region , patten has said . the united states sees it differently .
at a summit meeting with the israeli and palestinian prime ministers to adopt the road map in early june 2003 , president george w. bush made no mention of the eu .
the united states does n't consider europe an important player in the middle east . too friendly to the palestinians ? the european union , however , has had a special representative for the middle east peace process since 1996 .
in mid-july 2003 belgian diplomat marc otte took over the position . eu high representative for common foreign and security policy javier solana - something like a predecessor to a european foreign minister - is traveling through the region from august 29 to september 3 .
he has been personally engaged in the peace process . but as far as the u.s. and israel are concerned he is too friendly with the palestinians .
solana refuses to break off contacts with palestinian president yassir arafat and only communicate with the palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas , as the u.s. and israel do .
solana also finds it difficult sometimes to curry the support of eu foreign ministers ' for the frustrating peace process with its numerous setbacks . former nato secretary-general solana has written that particularly during times of despair europeans must strengthen their efforts .
the italian presidency of the eu has indicated it would like to bring together the ministers of the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the united states , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- in september .
french president jacques chirac has repeatedly called for europe to speak with one voice in the middle east too .
he has even said he would suggest a second road map to work for peace between israel and syria as well as between israel and lebanon . the eu as financier the eu does n't play a leading role on the political stage , but it does when it comes to financing the palestinian authority and humanitarian aid in the gaza strip and the west bank . according to chris patten , the eu has pumped € 10 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- into the palestinian authority every month since june 2001 just to ensure its continued existence - that is , paying a large part of the salaries of the more than 120,000 employees .
after the second intifada began israel froze the financial flows of tax and customs revenues to the palestinian authority .
the eu filled the gap . the european commission granted the palestinian authority an additional € 100 million in july , € 30 million of which were earmarked just for improving roads .
the peace plans came and went ; the eu continued to pay - more than half a billion euros for direct aid , loans and humanitarian programs in 2002 and 2003 alone . accusations from the media and eu parliamentarians that aid money has been misappropriated by the palestinian authority , headed by yassir arafat , have been dismissed by the accountants in brussels .
numerous independent audits had shown that nothing has gone astray , according to chris patten . aid for israel economic relations with israel are also close .
the eu is israel 's biggest trade partner and since 1995 israel has been part of a special eu program along with all of the mediterranean countries , from which aid money is distributed to israel and its neighbors . despite terror attacks and retaliatory strikes , direct contacts between the israelis and the palestinians continue when it comes to practical issues with the help of the eu .
the eu mediated an agreement between the israeli minister for infrastructure , joseph pritzky , and palestinian energy minister azzam shawwa on joint projects concerning energy supplies . such projects are just what eu high representative solana likes to see .

at a summit meeting with the israeli and palestinian prime ministers to adopt the road map in early june 2003 , president george w. bush made no mention of the eu .
the united states does n't consider europe an important player in the middle east . too friendly to the palestinians ? the european union , however , has had a special representative for the middle east peace process since 1996 .
in mid-july 2003 belgian diplomat marc otte took over the position . eu high representative for common foreign and security policy javier solana - something like a predecessor to a european foreign minister - is traveling through the region from august 29 to september 3 .
he has been personally engaged in the peace process . but as far as the u.s. and israel are concerned he is too friendly with the palestinians .
solana refuses to break off contacts with palestinian president yassir arafat and only communicate with the palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas , as the u.s. and israel do .
solana also finds it difficult sometimes to curry the support of eu foreign ministers ' for the frustrating peace process with its numerous setbacks . former nato secretary-general solana has written that particularly during times of despair europeans must strengthen their efforts .
the italian presidency of the eu has indicated it would like to bring together the ministers of the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the united states , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- in september .
french president jacques chirac has repeatedly called for europe to speak with one voice in the middle east too .
he has even said he would suggest a second road map to work for peace between israel and syria as well as between israel and lebanon . the eu as financier the eu does n't play a leading role on the political stage , but it does when it comes to financing the palestinian authority and humanitarian aid in the gaza strip and the west bank . according to chris patten , the eu has pumped € 10 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- into the palestinian authority every month since june 2001 just to ensure its continued existence - that is , paying a large part of the salaries of the more than 120,000 employees .
after the second intifada began israel froze the financial flows of tax and customs revenues to the palestinian authority .
the eu filled the gap . the european commission granted the palestinian authority an additional € 100 million in july , € 30 million of which were earmarked just for improving roads .
the peace plans came and went ; the eu continued to pay - more than half a billion euros for direct aid , loans and humanitarian programs in 2002 and 2003 alone . accusations from the media and eu parliamentarians that aid money has been misappropriated by the palestinian authority , headed by yassir arafat , have been dismissed by the accountants in brussels .
numerous independent audits had shown that nothing has gone astray , according to chris patten . aid for israel economic relations with israel are also close .
the eu is israel 's biggest trade partner and since 1995 israel has been part of a special eu program along with all of the mediterranean countries , from which aid money is distributed to israel and its neighbors . despite terror attacks and retaliatory strikes , direct contacts between the israelis and the palestinians continue when it comes to practical issues with the help of the eu .
the eu mediated an agreement between the israeli minister for infrastructure , joseph pritzky , and palestinian energy minister azzam shawwa on joint projects concerning energy supplies . such projects are just what eu high representative solana likes to see .
the spaniard is anxious to help create a climate of trust between the two sides .
in view of the daily violence , he 'll have to have a lot of patience .
solana has said he will report on his recent talks at the eu 's informal meeting of foreign ministers on friday and saturday . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : troubles in africa and the middle east monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa - including elections in rwanda - as well as trouble spots in the middle east .

but all that could change if the goethe institute ’ s new publicity campaign goes as planned . okay , pop quiz : what ’ s the first thing that comes into your head when you hear the word “ germany ” ?
if you ’ re british , the most popular answers may be adolf hitler , nazis and penalty shoot-outs . given that many britons have a negative view of germany – wars , world cups , towels on beach chairs , etc . – and have little interest in the language and culture , the goethe institute in london has launched a campaign aimed at promoting the learning of german and making the country ’ s image more attractive . the goethe institute , which promotes germany abroad , recently carried out a study in its london branch on the attitudes british people have towards germany and their knowledge about the country and its culture .
the result : there is a severe lack of interest in all things german . history stops at hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : history stops here .
the research showed that britons as a whole suffer from a particularly nasty case of skewed perception thanks to television schedules which tend to be packed with documentaries about the nazis and the holocaust - topics which also make up the majority of the history curriculum regarding germany in british schools .
armed with its new facts , figures and targets , the goethe institute is now fighting back with a publicity campaign which aims to fill mailboxes with postcards featuring übermodel claudia schiffer under the slogan “ learn german - and look good . ”
the campaign will target british students , teachers and cultural institutions .
" we 're very often asked how we intend to change opinions that have been entrenched for generations , " said karl pechatscheck , deputy director at the goethe institute in london in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we say we have to start sometime .
we have to start before future generations take up these ideas .
with more information about germany getting to the uk , the time is right now . "
the new initiative is the first application of ideas formed when staff at the london branch held a brainstorming session in july with corporate and cultural representatives in the hope of coming up with a new " brand " for germany .
" we discovered that it would be too hard to change germany 's brand , as many of the images associated with the country are too deep set , " ulrich sacker , the chairperson of the session , told the marketers , advertising execs and branding professionals gathered at the conference .

“ but we did decide that we 've got to start emphasizing current aspects of german life which are ignored - the hedonism for example of the love parade , the fact that we have short working days , that we take the longest holidays in europe . ”
however , by targeting academics and institutions , the campaign could already be preaching to the more easily convertible .
one might think aiming the program at the average person on the street would do more to change attitudes .
karl pechatscheck has other ideas .
" the campaign is run by our language department , " said pechatscheck , head of the section .
" by targeting schools and teachers , we can help pupils decide to learn german , not the german of hitler but the german of the love parade with new ideas of what germany is . "
the project is reminiscent of the new labour ’ s “ cool britannia ” campaign which sought to overturn widely held stereotypes of the british as uptight , bowler hat-wearing fuddy-duddies .
the campaigns coordinator ’ s insist a change of germany ’ s image would do more than just restore the country ’ s long-suffering pride .
stereotypes of germans held by the british have an impact on tourism , export , business , as well as on investment , according to the office of the german ambassador to london .

but all that could change if the goethe institute ’ s new publicity campaign goes as planned . okay , pop quiz : what ’ s the first thing that comes into your head when you hear the word “ germany ” ?
if you ’ re british , the most popular answers may be adolf hitler , nazis and penalty shoot-outs . given that many britons have a negative view of germany – wars , world cups , towels on beach chairs , etc . – and have little interest in the language and culture , the goethe institute in london has launched a campaign aimed at promoting the learning of german and making the country ’ s image more attractive . the goethe institute , which promotes germany abroad , recently carried out a study in its london branch on the attitudes british people have towards germany and their knowledge about the country and its culture .
the result : there is a severe lack of interest in all things german . history stops at hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : history stops here .
the research showed that britons as a whole suffer from a particularly nasty case of skewed perception thanks to television schedules which tend to be packed with documentaries about the nazis and the holocaust - topics which also make up the majority of the history curriculum regarding germany in british schools .
armed with its new facts , figures and targets , the goethe institute is now fighting back with a publicity campaign which aims to fill mailboxes with postcards featuring übermodel claudia schiffer under the slogan “ learn german - and look good . ”
the campaign will target british students , teachers and cultural institutions .
" we 're very often asked how we intend to change opinions that have been entrenched for generations , " said karl pechatscheck , deputy director at the goethe institute in london in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we say we have to start sometime .
we have to start before future generations take up these ideas .
with more information about germany getting to the uk , the time is right now . "
the new initiative is the first application of ideas formed when staff at the london branch held a brainstorming session in july with corporate and cultural representatives in the hope of coming up with a new " brand " for germany .
" we discovered that it would be too hard to change germany 's brand , as many of the images associated with the country are too deep set , " ulrich sacker , the chairperson of the session , told the marketers , advertising execs and branding professionals gathered at the conference .

“ but we did decide that we 've got to start emphasizing current aspects of german life which are ignored - the hedonism for example of the love parade , the fact that we have short working days , that we take the longest holidays in europe . ”
however , by targeting academics and institutions , the campaign could already be preaching to the more easily convertible .
one might think aiming the program at the average person on the street would do more to change attitudes .
karl pechatscheck has other ideas .
" the campaign is run by our language department , " said pechatscheck , head of the section .
" by targeting schools and teachers , we can help pupils decide to learn german , not the german of hitler but the german of the love parade with new ideas of what germany is . "
the project is reminiscent of the new labour ’ s “ cool britannia ” campaign which sought to overturn widely held stereotypes of the british as uptight , bowler hat-wearing fuddy-duddies .
the campaigns coordinator ’ s insist a change of germany ’ s image would do more than just restore the country ’ s long-suffering pride .
stereotypes of germans held by the british have an impact on tourism , export , business , as well as on investment , according to the office of the german ambassador to london .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 01.09.2003 german-turkish relations scrutinized on eve of erdogan visit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's prime minister erdogan will arrive in berlin with a busy agenda turkish prime minister recep tayyip erdogan arrives in germany on monday night for a visit that promises to be full of difficult discussions with german leaders . while in the capital for his first official visit , erdogan is scheduled to meet with chancellor gerhard schröder and foreign minister joschka fischer but is not expected not try and woo either for german support of his country ’ s accession to the european union . however , the subject of eu membership is unlikely to remain dormant while erdogan is in germany .
turkey is one of 13 candidates to join the 15-nation eu but , so far , it has been refused a starting date for its membership negotiations because brussels says it has not carried out sufficient reforms to bring its democracy up to western standards .
despite this , germany defended ankara ’ s bid at the eu enlargement summit in copenhagen last december .
fischer makes positive noises in contrast , german foreign minister fischer has recently praised turkish efforts to bring the country into line .
in an interview published on the day when the turkish prime minister is expected , fischer told the business daily handelsblatt newspaper : “ turkey is working seriously and intensively to further open the door to membership of the european union . ”
fischer ’ s words are likely to be the ice breaker at a time when relations between the two countries are certainly frosty .
ties have recently been strained by turkey ’ s decision to strip some of its nationals abroad of their passports for failing to do military service .
the federal government is afraid that the move by its turkish counterpart could leave germany with a number of stateless people of turkish origin who could not be deported even if they committed serious crimes and it has warned turkey the move could harm its eu bid .
kaplan affair could cause discomfort bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muhammed metin kaplan , the " caliph of cologne . "
this could also lead to uncomfortable discussions surrounding the fate of metin kaplan , an extremist leader known as the “ caliph of cologne ” who is living in germany and who is wanted by ankara for treason .
turkey has demanded that kaplan be extradited but this move was blocked last week by a german court .
unhappy voices speaking out from ankara about the kaplan affair have already made themselves heard in germany on the day erdogan arrives .
hüseyin diriöz , spokesperson for the turkish foreign ministry , said on monday that the german decision to block ankara ’ s attempts at extradition were “ wrong , unjustified , with prejudices and inadequate assessments of the independent turkish justice system . ”
conservatives oppose eu membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bavarian governor edmund stoiber .
turkey is also facing opposition within the german parliament to its eu plans .
germany ’ s conservatives have made it known that they are against the idea of turkey joining the bloc with german help .
edmund stoiber , the premier of the state of bavaria , voiced his party ’ s views during last year ’ s general election , saying “ for us , eu membership for turkey is inconceivable . ” germans opposed to turkey ’ s accession range from those who feel turkey ’ s islamic culture would not fit within that of europe to those concerned about the effect of turkish workers on the ailing labor market .
germany is home to more than two million turks , estimated to be the largest turkish community in western europe and is turkey ’ s most important business partner . reformist association to open in berlin business will certainly be on the agenda in some capacity when erdogan begins his visit proper .
the turkish premier will open the berlin branch of the turkish industrial association , tüsiad , in the capital .
the association has been behind a number of radical reform process ideas in turkey that have been linked with the country ’ s push for eu memebership . it is also likely that erdogan and the germans will discuss the possibility of easing arms export restrictions that have stopped the federal government supplying turkey with battle tanks . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de turkish leader hopes berlin will support eu bid turkish prime minister erdogan visits germany on monday , hoping berlin will support ankara ’ s eu bid .
but germany remains split even as media reports say it could ease arms export restrictions to turkey .
-lrb- august 31 , 2003 -rrb- turkey pushes forward on eu reform course in a move designed to harmonize its human rights standards with those of europe , turkey has approved an amnesty for kurdish rebels .

but the eu 's influence there is limited . it was actually the european union which devised the " road map " to peace in the middle east .
the first draft emerged during the danish presidency of the eu in autumn 2002 , according to chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations .
the remaining members of the middle east quartet - the united states , russia and the united nations - accepted and reworked the eu 's plan to create a viable palestinian state and bring an end to terror in the region , patten has said . the united states sees it differently .
at a summit meeting with the israeli and palestinian prime ministers to adopt the road map in early june 2003 , president george w. bush made no mention of the eu .
the united states does n't consider europe an important player in the middle east . too friendly to the palestinians ? the european union , however , has had a special representative for the middle east peace process since 1996 .
in mid-july 2003 belgian diplomat marc otte took over the position . eu high representative for common foreign and security policy javier solana - something like a predecessor to a european foreign minister - is traveling through the region from august 29 to september 3 .
he has been personally engaged in the peace process . but as far as the u.s. and israel are concerned he is too friendly with the palestinians .
solana refuses to break off contacts with palestinian president yassir arafat and only communicate with the palestinian prime minister mahmoud abbas , as the u.s. and israel do .
solana also finds it difficult sometimes to curry the support of eu foreign ministers ' for the frustrating peace process with its numerous setbacks . former nato secretary-general solana has written that particularly during times of despair europeans must strengthen their efforts .
the italian presidency of the eu has indicated it would like to bring together the ministers of the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the united states , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- in september .
french president jacques chirac has repeatedly called for europe to speak with one voice in the middle east too .
he has even said he would suggest a second road map to work for peace between israel and syria as well as between israel and lebanon . the eu as financier the eu does n't play a leading role on the political stage , but it does when it comes to financing the palestinian authority and humanitarian aid in the gaza strip and the west bank . according to chris patten , the eu has pumped € 10 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- into the palestinian authority every month since june 2001 just to ensure its continued existence - that is , paying a large part of the salaries of the more than 120,000 employees .
after the second intifada began israel froze the financial flows of tax and customs revenues to the palestinian authority .
the eu filled the gap . the european commission granted the palestinian authority an additional € 100 million in july , € 30 million of which were earmarked just for improving roads .
the peace plans came and went ; the eu continued to pay - more than half a billion euros for direct aid , loans and humanitarian programs in 2002 and 2003 alone . accusations from the media and eu parliamentarians that aid money has been misappropriated by the palestinian authority , headed by yassir arafat , have been dismissed by the accountants in brussels .
numerous independent audits had shown that nothing has gone astray , according to chris patten . aid for israel economic relations with israel are also close .
the eu is israel 's biggest trade partner and since 1995 israel has been part of a special eu program along with all of the mediterranean countries , from which aid money is distributed to israel and its neighbors . despite terror attacks and retaliatory strikes , direct contacts between the israelis and the palestinians continue when it comes to practical issues with the help of the eu .
the eu mediated an agreement between the israeli minister for infrastructure , joseph pritzky , and palestinian energy minister azzam shawwa on joint projects concerning energy supplies . such projects are just what eu high representative solana likes to see .
the spaniard is anxious to help create a climate of trust between the two sides .
in view of the daily violence , he 'll have to have a lot of patience .
solana has said he will report on his recent talks at the eu 's informal meeting of foreign ministers on friday and saturday . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : troubles in africa and the middle east monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa - including elections in rwanda - as well as trouble spots in the middle east .

the company , deutsche system lotto gmbh , convinced an estimated 8,000 individuals throughout germany to enter into contracts that guaranteed a payout of up to € 125,000 -lrb- $ 137,000 -rrb- if they did not win a ‘ fiver ’ or ‘ sixer ’ lottery draw within a year .
the contracts stipulated that players pay from € 7 to € 700 weekly into a pool , funds from which were supposed to be used to play the lottery .
district attorneys investigating the case say no more than € 5,000 of the pool ’ s money actually went to lottery tickets .
they suspect some € 1.5 million went directly into the pockets of the firm ’ s management , six of which are now in police custody . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

but all that could change if the goethe institute ’ s new publicity campaign goes as planned . okay , pop quiz : what ’ s the first thing that comes into your head when you hear the word “ germany ” ?
if you ’ re british , the most popular answers may be adolf hitler , nazis and penalty shoot-outs . given that many britons have a negative view of germany – wars , world cups , towels on beach chairs , etc . – and have little interest in the language and culture , the goethe institute in london has launched a campaign aimed at promoting the learning of german and making the country ’ s image more attractive . the goethe institute , which promotes germany abroad , recently carried out a study in its london branch on the attitudes british people have towards germany and their knowledge about the country and its culture .
the result : there is a severe lack of interest in all things german . history stops at hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : history stops here .
the research showed that britons as a whole suffer from a particularly nasty case of skewed perception thanks to television schedules which tend to be packed with documentaries about the nazis and the holocaust - topics which also make up the majority of the history curriculum regarding germany in british schools .
armed with its new facts , figures and targets , the goethe institute is now fighting back with a publicity campaign which aims to fill mailboxes with postcards featuring übermodel claudia schiffer under the slogan “ learn german - and look good . ”
the campaign will target british students , teachers and cultural institutions .
" we 're very often asked how we intend to change opinions that have been entrenched for generations , " said karl pechatscheck , deputy director at the goethe institute in london in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we say we have to start sometime .
we have to start before future generations take up these ideas .
with more information about germany getting to the uk , the time is right now . "
the new initiative is the first application of ideas formed when staff at the london branch held a brainstorming session in july with corporate and cultural representatives in the hope of coming up with a new " brand " for germany .
" we discovered that it would be too hard to change germany 's brand , as many of the images associated with the country are too deep set , " ulrich sacker , the chairperson of the session , told the marketers , advertising execs and branding professionals gathered at the conference .
accentuate the positive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : love parade 2001 in berlin .
“ but we did decide that we 've got to start emphasizing current aspects of german life which are ignored - the hedonism for example of the love parade , the fact that we have short working days , that we take the longest holidays in europe . ”
however , by targeting academics and institutions , the campaign could already be preaching to the more easily convertible .
one might think aiming the program at the average person on the street would do more to change attitudes .
karl pechatscheck has other ideas .
" the campaign is run by our language department , " said pechatscheck , head of the section .
" by targeting schools and teachers , we can help pupils decide to learn german , not the german of hitler but the german of the love parade with new ideas of what germany is . "
the project is reminiscent of the new labour ’ s “ cool britannia ” campaign which sought to overturn widely held stereotypes of the british as uptight , bowler hat-wearing fuddy-duddies .
the campaigns coordinator ’ s insist a change of germany ’ s image would do more than just restore the country ’ s long-suffering pride .
stereotypes of germans held by the british have an impact on tourism , export , business , as well as on investment , according to the office of the german ambassador to london .

but the eu 's influence there is limited . it was actually the european union which devised the " road map " to peace in the middle east .
the first draft emerged during the danish presidency of the eu in autumn 2002 , according to chris patten , eu commissioner for external relations .

solana also finds it difficult sometimes to curry the support of eu foreign ministers ' for the frustrating peace process with its numerous setbacks . former nato secretary-general solana has written that particularly during times of despair europeans must strengthen their efforts .
the italian presidency of the eu has indicated it would like to bring together the ministers of the so-called middle east quartet -lrb- the united states , the eu , russia and the un -rrb- in september .
french president jacques chirac has repeatedly called for europe to speak with one voice in the middle east too .
he has even said he would suggest a second road map to work for peace between israel and syria as well as between israel and lebanon . the eu as financier the eu does n't play a leading role on the political stage , but it does when it comes to financing the palestinian authority and humanitarian aid in the gaza strip and the west bank . according to chris patten , the eu has pumped € 10 million -lrb- $ 11 million -rrb- into the palestinian authority every month since june 2001 just to ensure its continued existence - that is , paying a large part of the salaries of the more than 120,000 employees .
after the second intifada began israel froze the financial flows of tax and customs revenues to the palestinian authority .
the eu filled the gap . the european commission granted the palestinian authority an additional € 100 million in july , € 30 million of which were earmarked just for improving roads .
the peace plans came and went ; the eu continued to pay - more than half a billion euros for direct aid , loans and humanitarian programs in 2002 and 2003 alone . accusations from the media and eu parliamentarians that aid money has been misappropriated by the palestinian authority , headed by yassir arafat , have been dismissed by the accountants in brussels .
numerous independent audits had shown that nothing has gone astray , according to chris patten . aid for israel economic relations with israel are also close .
the eu is israel 's biggest trade partner and since 1995 israel has been part of a special eu program along with all of the mediterranean countries , from which aid money is distributed to israel and its neighbors . despite terror attacks and retaliatory strikes , direct contacts between the israelis and the palestinians continue when it comes to practical issues with the help of the eu .
the eu mediated an agreement between the israeli minister for infrastructure , joseph pritzky , and palestinian energy minister azzam shawwa on joint projects concerning energy supplies . such projects are just what eu high representative solana likes to see .
the spaniard is anxious to help create a climate of trust between the two sides .
in view of the daily violence , he 'll have to have a lot of patience .
solana has said he will report on his recent talks at the eu 's informal meeting of foreign ministers on friday and saturday . bernd riegert send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european press review : troubles in africa and the middle east monday ’ s european newspapers commented on events in africa - including elections in rwanda - as well as trouble spots in the middle east .

turkey is one of 13 candidates to join the 15-nation eu but , so far , it has been refused a starting date for its membership negotiations because brussels says it has not carried out sufficient reforms to bring its democracy up to western standards .

but all that could change if the goethe institute ’ s new publicity campaign goes as planned . okay , pop quiz : what ’ s the first thing that comes into your head when you hear the word “ germany ” ?
if you ’ re british , the most popular answers may be adolf hitler , nazis and penalty shoot-outs . given that many britons have a negative view of germany – wars , world cups , towels on beach chairs , etc . – and have little interest in the language and culture , the goethe institute in london has launched a campaign aimed at promoting the learning of german and making the country ’ s image more attractive . the goethe institute , which promotes germany abroad , recently carried out a study in its london branch on the attitudes british people have towards germany and their knowledge about the country and its culture .
the result : there is a severe lack of interest in all things german . history stops at hitler bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : history stops here .
the research showed that britons as a whole suffer from a particularly nasty case of skewed perception thanks to television schedules which tend to be packed with documentaries about the nazis and the holocaust - topics which also make up the majority of the history curriculum regarding germany in british schools .
armed with its new facts , figures and targets , the goethe institute is now fighting back with a publicity campaign which aims to fill mailboxes with postcards featuring übermodel claudia schiffer under the slogan “ learn german - and look good . ”
the campaign will target british students , teachers and cultural institutions .
" we 're very often asked how we intend to change opinions that have been entrenched for generations , " said karl pechatscheck , deputy director at the goethe institute in london in an interview with deutsche welle .
" we say we have to start sometime .
we have to start before future generations take up these ideas .
with more information about germany getting to the uk , the time is right now . "
the new initiative is the first application of ideas formed when staff at the london branch held a brainstorming session in july with corporate and cultural representatives in the hope of coming up with a new " brand " for germany .
" we discovered that it would be too hard to change germany 's brand , as many of the images associated with the country are too deep set , " ulrich sacker , the chairperson of the session , told the marketers , advertising execs and branding professionals gathered at the conference .

however , by targeting academics and institutions , the campaign could already be preaching to the more easily convertible .
one might think aiming the program at the average person on the street would do more to change attitudes .
karl pechatscheck has other ideas .
" the campaign is run by our language department , " said pechatscheck , head of the section .
" by targeting schools and teachers , we can help pupils decide to learn german , not the german of hitler but the german of the love parade with new ideas of what germany is . "
the project is reminiscent of the new labour ’ s “ cool britannia ” campaign which sought to overturn widely held stereotypes of the british as uptight , bowler hat-wearing fuddy-duddies .

nearly two years after the fall of the taleban , most afghan women , who faced draconian restrictions on their every move , have seen little or no improvement in their lives .
while some girls are attending schools and some women have been able to go back to work , most still face discrimination in their everyday lives .
this new government department aims to encourage women to enter the world of commerce - something that would have been unthinkable under the taleban .
it will offer women small loans , teach them basic business skills and help them to exhibit the handicrafts they make .
but while many countries have expressed support , so far the department has very little funding .
traditionally afghan women have woven carpets or sewed clothing in the confines of their homes , but they have not been able to use these skills to set up private businesses .
ongoing discrimination that is partly because most of them face as much oppression now as they did under the widely condemned taleban regime .
as well as limited access to education and jobs , women and girls are still subjected to systematic abuses - such as forced virginity tests , being sold by their male relatives , torture and rape .
a recent report by human rights watch said many afghan women and girls are too frightened to leave their homes , because they are being targeted for kidnap and rape by afghan soldiers .
the report said the violence is so bad that returning refugee families who had sent their girls to school in pakistan and iran were too frightened to do the same in afghanistan .

ingrid betancourt , a former presidential candidate , delivered her plea in a videotape which was broadcast on colombian television on saturday .
the videotape was the first evidence in more than a year that ms betancourt was still alive .
she was kidnapped in february 2002 , along with her campaign manager , by guerrillas from the revolutionary armed forces of colombia -lrb- farc -rrb- .
the guerrillas want a number of rebel prisoners freed in return for ms betancourt 's release .
' be careful ' in her message , a haggard and gaunt looking ms betancourt said president uribe alone must decide whether to authorise a rescue mission .
i support a rescue but only if it 's going to be well-planned juan carlos lecompte , husband " it 's important that it be the president who directly makes this decision .
i believe it is not a military decision , but a political one , " she said .
president uribe told reporters ms betancourt 's plea " is something the government must handle very carefully , which the defence ministry has to analyse .
" i believe that the government 's only response is , be careful , " he said .
the danger of trying to rescue hostages was highlighted in may of this year , when farc guerrillas killed 10 captives as government soldiers closed in on them .
rescue fears ms betancourt 's family has consistently opposed mounting a rescue mission , but defence minister marta lucia ramirez said the video might change their minds .
" i believe that with this statement from ingrid we will have the opportunity to have discussions with her family ... which will in the future permit us to rescue her , " he said .
ms betancourt 's husband , juan carlos lecompte , said he was now in favour of a rescue attempt .
" i support a rescue but only if it 's going to be well-planned , " he said .
ms betancourt 's mother , yolando pulecio , said she was afraid a rescue attempt might end in failure .
" she is very brave , but to me , a mother , a rescue terrifies me , " she said .
ms betancourt is one of the most high-profile of about 850 captives held by the farc .
last year , nearly 3,000 people were taken hostage in colombia , which has the highest incidence of kidnapping anywhere in the world .

jack swanston had brought the 23 drawings and watercolours to be valued when the programme visited his area , dumfries in scotland .
but he never realised the value of the collection which belonged to his wife 's family , which is now going into a bank for safe keeping .
potter would write out her stories in an exercise book , paste in a few watercolours and a number of pen-and-ink sketches and then present it as a gift to a favoured child .
in this way , she was able to try out her books on real children first but she would borrow the little books back while working on the finished illustrations .
although born in london in 1866 , she married and moved to cumbria , where she created her famous characters .
' human settings ' she spent her last few decades extending her farm property and raising herdwick sheep before her death in 1943 , aged 77 .
clive farahar , an antiquarian book seller who examined the pieces for the sunday evening show , said : " the story is they came through mr swanston 's wife 's family .
" her grandfather knew beatrix potter 's brother who farmed in the borders quite near to the artist 's home .
" a lot of these pre-date peter rabbit which came out in 1902 , many are sketches and a lot are half finished which does n't make them any less interesting .
" they show small animals like kittens or mice and rabbits set in human settings doing human things . "
benjamin bunny potter created around 20 well-loved children 's tales involving a host of animal characters including benjamin bunny , jemima puddle-duck , and mrs tiggy-winkle .
she was born in 1866 in south kensington , london , and she initially published her first book peter rabbit herself before finding a publisher .

digby jones , director general of the confederation of british industry , told the bbc radio 4 's today programme that unions and bosses were growing apart at a time when the uk was facing a potentially damaging rise in employment legislation .
mr jones also accused the unions of " outright obstruction " on the issue of public service reform , saying their stance was motivated by a desire to defend their power bases , rather than concern for those who use public services .
" unions are tending to be a block to reform , " he said .
" they are tending to put ideology and the arguments of yesterday ahead of the interests of most of their members . "
tuc speech many trade union groups are resisting government efforts to increase the role of the private sector in delivering public services on the grounds that workers employed by private sector sub-contractors are often paid less than their public sector counterparts .
mr jones also urged the unions to work together with industry chiefs in an effort to prepare the british workforce and economy for the challenge of growing global competition .
" i only wish that trade unions , especially those who are adopting a more militant attitude to many things , would fight the battles of tomorrow , and stop fighting the battles of yesterday . "
mr jones warned that the rise of union militancy came at a time when the uk was losing its competitive advantage because of rising employment regulation and poor workforce skills .
but bill morris , general secretary of the transport and general workers ' union , denied that trade unions were obstructing reform .
" we 're facilitating the reforms in the public services , there 's a constant and regular dialogue .
but what we 're not getting is cooperation , particularly from the cbi , because the cbi stands as a block to progress , " he said .
mr jones ' attack on the unions comes one week before he is due to address the annual conference of the trades union congress in brighton .
it will be only the third time that a cbi director has spoken at the trade union movement 's biggest annual get-together .

ieuan wyn jones announced just after may 's welsh assembly elections that he would be stepping down as president .
former am and mp cynog dafis is trying for the post , as is current party vice-president and folk singer dafydd iwan are contesting the post .
mr jones is also facing competition to hold onto his job as leader of the party in the assembly debating chamber - ams helen mary jones and rhodri glyn thomas are after the role .
meanwhile , bbc radio wales has learned that delegates at the party conference later this month will re-open the vexed question of whether the party 's long-term aim should be independence .
plaid cymru has never advocated independence - preferring to campaign for what it calls full national status , for fear of scaring off voters outside traditional nationalist heartlands .
but party insiders have revealed that many members want a strong commitment to independence , with wales becoming a full member of the united nations .
the subject is expected to spark a lively debate at the annual conference , which starts at st david 's hall in cardiff on 18 september - just days after the holders of the key posts are filled .
the first round of hustings for both leadership posts - at which all of the candidates will be available to answer questions - is being held at newi college in wrexham on monday night .
over the next fortnight , further meetings will be held at locations including bangor , blackwood , aberystwyth , carmarthen and swansea .
ieuan wyn jones announced in may he was standing down from both roles , after plaid lost five of the 17 seats it had won in the 1999 elections in the may 2003 poll .
but he later decided to launch a bid to keep the role of assembly group leader .
he is up against helen mary jones , who represents mid and west wales , and rhodri glyn thomas , am for carmarthen east and dinefwr .
however , he will hand over the presidency to either cynog dafis , the party 's policy director , or dafydd iwan , depending on what party members decide .
votes will be counted on monday , 15 september , with all votes expected to arrive before midday on that day .

ieuan wyn jones announced just after may 's welsh assembly elections that he would be stepping down as president .
former am and mp cynog dafis is trying for the post , as is current party vice-president and folk singer dafydd iwan are contesting the post .
mr jones is also facing competition to hold onto his job as leader of the party in the assembly debating chamber - ams helen mary jones and rhodri glyn thomas are after the role .
meanwhile , bbc radio wales has learned that delegates at the party conference later this month will re-open the vexed question of whether the party 's long-term aim should be independence .
plaid cymru has never advocated independence - preferring to campaign for what it calls full national status , for fear of scaring off voters outside traditional nationalist heartlands .
but party insiders have revealed that many members want a strong commitment to independence , with wales becoming a full member of the united nations .
ieuan wyn jones hopes to keep leading plaid in the assembly the subject is expected to spark a lively debate at the annual conference , which starts at st david 's hall in cardiff on 18 september - just days after the holders of the key posts are filled .
the first round of hustings for both leadership posts - at which all of the candidates will be available to answer questions - is being held at newi college in wrexham on monday night .
over the next fortnight , further meetings will be held at locations including bangor , blackwood , aberystwyth , carmarthen and swansea .
ieuan wyn jones announced in may he was standing down from both roles , after plaid lost five of the 17 seats it had won in the 1999 elections in the may 2003 poll .
but he later decided to launch a bid to keep the role of assembly group leader .
he is up against helen mary jones , who represents mid and west wales , and rhodri glyn thomas , am for carmarthen east and dinefwr .
however , he will hand over the presidency to either cynog dafis , the party 's policy director , or dafydd iwan , depending on what party members decide .
votes will be counted on monday , 15 september , with all votes expected to arrive before midday on that day .

scientists have found a way for people to sign their name online using a mouse instead of a pen .
the security system uses smart software trained to recognise the way that someone uses a mouse to write out their name or another identifying symbol .
the system could be used to verify that people using a website are who they claim to be or provide another level of checking when people use credit cards online .

" you could sign your name of another reproducible figure that you can use in place of your signature , " he said .
the neural network inside the software needs about 20 examples of the way that someone signs their name with a mouse to learn its important characteristics , said dr mcowan .
how someone uses a mouse is as distinctive as the way they use a pen , said dr mcowan .
" it 's an extra biometric layer on top of traditional passwords , " he said .
" it 's another way of indicating that you as an individual are sitting there on the end of the line . "
dr mcowan said the system is easy to install on machines as it needs only software to operate .
it can keep an eye on the way that someone uses a mouse and refine information about distinctive mouse movements over time .
the security system works with both optical and mechanical mice .
early trials of the system on students in the computer science department at queen mary showed that it was 99 % accurate in spotting who was using a mouse to sign .

bbc news -pipe- have your say -pipe- is there a shortage of teachers ?
home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : monday , 1 september , 2003 , 08:20 gmt 09:20 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version is there a shortage of teachers ?
secondary schools have lost almost 3,500 teaching posts in this year 's funding crisis , a survey suggests .
the times educational supplement says head teachers have had to make redundancies and ca n't afford to replace teachers who 've left their jobs .
the government has dismissed the survey , saying that not enough schools were questioned to make it representative -lrb- 480 head teachers were polled -rrb- .
instead , the government blames the cuts on falling pupil numbers , rather than budget shortages of up to £ 500,000 suffered by many schools .
is there a teacher shortage in your school ?
do schools deserve more money ?
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : it would n't do harm for teachers to take a pay freeze .
there are numerous teachers where i live , in a commuter belt village , with their expensive houses , brand new cars and umpteen holidays per year - and they make us think they 're low paid ?
brian , lancashire , uk the government should be forced to publish the numbers of real teachers at the " chalk face " versus the numbers of administrators , advisors , co-ordinators , special projects , planners -lrb- ! -rrb- and various other money wasters employed in all the various departments that are associated with education .
then we see where all the money goes .
this problem is n't one of lack of money , its one of wasted money .
john r smith , uk i work for an inner london borough which currently has an education ' hiring freeze ' .
this has been in operation for at least six months now and has meant that all support service staff have to be hired on a supply basis , with payments to agencies which must have exceeded the cost of hiring staff on a termly or permanent basis .
central and local government need to get a grip on the situation if they are to convince us that they have the best interests of our children at heart .
anon , london , uk they do nothing to retain experienced teachers duncan , uk the government makes a big deal of getting new teachers into the system but they do nothing to retain experienced teachers .
why ?
because new recruits are cheaper to employ , you can get two new recruits for the same salary as a very experienced teacher .
this government does n't care about the welfare of our children .
if they did they would want continuity in the education system , not the cheapest option .
duncan , uk we are supposed to be the fourth richest economy in the world and yet we still ca n't value education .
where does it say that falling pupil numbers means that you have to lose a teacher ?
maybe you could have smaller class sizes ?
we have 39 in our year 5/6 class next year .
how are we supposed to provide all of them with a decent quality education ?
robin duckworth , uk my wife is a classroom assistant who has recently had to undertake a lot of training though she gets very low pay .
the fact is that there are too few teachers and cash is not reaching the schools .
the government will say that according to their statistics they have the right number of teachers for the future but that is not now .
tony , welling , kent everyone seems to harp on about lack of teachers , and in particular the chaos that this will cause in the future ...
i find it hard to believe that the number of teachers will persist in being a problem going forward because so many people seem to be signing up for teacher training !
loads of my mates are doing it ...
i would n't have the patience myself !
stu , uk yes there is a shortage in the school i work in .
every year we are a few teachers down and we have to rely on long term supply which is more costly .
we are in the red by nearly £ 400,000 and its all due to staff wages .
the government needs to put more money into the schools where it matters .
chris ashbey , uk take all the money and give it to the schools john r smith , uk get " big government " off the backs of the schools ! !
take all the money spent on the dept of education , the leas , all various funding committees and talking shops and give it to the schools .
let the headteachers pay whatever they feel is right to get the staff they need and the facilities to go with them .
once pay is up to professional standards the right numbers of high quality recruits will follow .
the current system is a money wasting failure .
john r smith , uk for years the teaching unions lobbied for changes in the way that teachers were treated , they wanted to be paid for every ' extra ' carried out , supervision of mealtimes , playtimes , etc .
now that teachers are being treated as the hourly paid workers they wished to become everyone is surprised .
barry p , england the times research is probably correct .
in which case , the economic state of the country worries me even more .
if we ca n't competitively prepare our future workers for the global economy , then where does that leave the uk in the future ?
david boiardi , uk you have to be a masochist to become a teacher these days vish , uk of course there is .
let 's face it , you have to be a masochist to become a teacher these days .
low pay , unruly kids , even more unruly parents , everyone tries to blame the world 's ills on you and no matter how hard you work people are still not happy .
i have the utmost respect for all teachers in this country but i do encourage every single last one of them to stick two fingers up to the government and to the public who give them such a hard time and get higher paid jobs in the private sector .
vish , uk surely the reason why schools have less money is the soaring cost of maintaining the extremely expensive teachers ' final salary pension scheme ?
a firefighter friend told me that the fire service have the same problem - the pension scheme costs so much to run that many brigades ca n't afford to buy new vehicles .
helen , england i believe that like other public establishments like hospitals the money is there but it is where it is being spent that is the issue .
when i was in secondary school they were always advertising the fact they had purchased several new computers - but us kids never saw them as they were for the school office .
staff rooms would be improved but the classrooms would be falling down around our ears .
sarah , uk sarah , uk ... you have no idea of the poor conditions teachers work under .

secondary schools have lost almost 3,500 teaching posts in this year 's funding crisis , a survey suggests .
the times educational supplement says head teachers have had to make redundancies and ca n't afford to replace teachers who 've left their jobs .
the government has dismissed the survey , saying that not enough schools were questioned to make it representative -lrb- 480 head teachers were polled -rrb- .
instead , the government blames the cuts on falling pupil numbers , rather than budget shortages of up to £ 500,000 suffered by many schools .
is there a teacher shortage in your school ?
do schools deserve more money ?
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : it would n't do harm for teachers to take a pay freeze .
there are numerous teachers where i live , in a commuter belt village , with their expensive houses , brand new cars and umpteen holidays per year - and they make us think they 're low paid ?
brian , lancashire , uk the government should be forced to publish the numbers of real teachers at the " chalk face " versus the numbers of administrators , advisors , co-ordinators , special projects , planners -lrb- ! -rrb- and various other money wasters employed in all the various departments that are associated with education .
then we see where all the money goes .
this problem is n't one of lack of money , its one of wasted money .
john r smith , uk i work for an inner london borough which currently has an education ' hiring freeze ' .
this has been in operation for at least six months now and has meant that all support service staff have to be hired on a supply basis , with payments to agencies which must have exceeded the cost of hiring staff on a termly or permanent basis .
central and local government need to get a grip on the situation if they are to convince us that they have the best interests of our children at heart .
anon , london , uk they do nothing to retain experienced teachers duncan , uk the government makes a big deal of getting new teachers into the system but they do nothing to retain experienced teachers .
why ?
because new recruits are cheaper to employ , you can get two new recruits for the same salary as a very experienced teacher .
this government does n't care about the welfare of our children .
if they did they would want continuity in the education system , not the cheapest option .
duncan , uk we are supposed to be the fourth richest economy in the world and yet we still ca n't value education .
where does it say that falling pupil numbers means that you have to lose a teacher ?
maybe you could have smaller class sizes ?
we have 39 in our year 5/6 class next year .
how are we supposed to provide all of them with a decent quality education ?
robin duckworth , uk my wife is a classroom assistant who has recently had to undertake a lot of training though she gets very low pay .
the fact is that there are too few teachers and cash is not reaching the schools .
the government will say that according to their statistics they have the right number of teachers for the future but that is not now .
tony , welling , kent everyone seems to harp on about lack of teachers , and in particular the chaos that this will cause in the future ...
i find it hard to believe that the number of teachers will persist in being a problem going forward because so many people seem to be signing up for teacher training !
loads of my mates are doing it ...
i would n't have the patience myself !
stu , uk yes there is a shortage in the school i work in .
every year we are a few teachers down and we have to rely on long term supply which is more costly .
we are in the red by nearly £ 400,000 and its all due to staff wages .
the government needs to put more money into the schools where it matters .
chris ashbey , uk take all the money and give it to the schools john r smith , uk get " big government " off the backs of the schools ! !
take all the money spent on the dept of education , the leas , all various funding committees and talking shops and give it to the schools .
let the headteachers pay whatever they feel is right to get the staff they need and the facilities to go with them .
once pay is up to professional standards the right numbers of high quality recruits will follow .
the current system is a money wasting failure .
john r smith , uk for years the teaching unions lobbied for changes in the way that teachers were treated , they wanted to be paid for every ' extra ' carried out , supervision of mealtimes , playtimes , etc .
now that teachers are being treated as the hourly paid workers they wished to become everyone is surprised .
barry p , england the times research is probably correct .
in which case , the economic state of the country worries me even more .
if we ca n't competitively prepare our future workers for the global economy , then where does that leave the uk in the future ?
david boiardi , uk you have to be a masochist to become a teacher these days vish , uk of course there is .
let 's face it , you have to be a masochist to become a teacher these days .
low pay , unruly kids , even more unruly parents , everyone tries to blame the world 's ills on you and no matter how hard you work people are still not happy .
i have the utmost respect for all teachers in this country but i do encourage every single last one of them to stick two fingers up to the government and to the public who give them such a hard time and get higher paid jobs in the private sector .
vish , uk surely the reason why schools have less money is the soaring cost of maintaining the extremely expensive teachers ' final salary pension scheme ?
a firefighter friend told me that the fire service have the same problem - the pension scheme costs so much to run that many brigades ca n't afford to buy new vehicles .
helen , england i believe that like other public establishments like hospitals the money is there but it is where it is being spent that is the issue .
when i was in secondary school they were always advertising the fact they had purchased several new computers - but us kids never saw them as they were for the school office .
staff rooms would be improved but the classrooms would be falling down around our ears .

secondary schools have lost almost 3,500 teaching posts in this year 's funding crisis , a survey suggests .
the times educational supplement says head teachers have had to make redundancies and ca n't afford to replace teachers who 've left their jobs .
the government has dismissed the survey , saying that not enough schools were questioned to make it representative -lrb- 480 head teachers were polled -rrb- .
instead , the government blames the cuts on falling pupil numbers , rather than budget shortages of up to £ 500,000 suffered by many schools .
is there a teacher shortage in your school ?
do schools deserve more money ?
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : it would n't do harm for teachers to take a pay freeze .
there are numerous teachers where i live , in a commuter belt village , with their expensive houses , brand new cars and umpteen holidays per year - and they make us think they 're low paid ?
brian , lancashire , uk the government should be forced to publish the numbers of real teachers at the " chalk face " versus the numbers of administrators , advisors , co-ordinators , special projects , planners -lrb- ! -rrb- and various other money wasters employed in all the various departments that are associated with education .
then we see where all the money goes .
this problem is n't one of lack of money , its one of wasted money .
john r smith , uk i work for an inner london borough which currently has an education ' hiring freeze ' .
this has been in operation for at least six months now and has meant that all support service staff have to be hired on a supply basis , with payments to agencies which must have exceeded the cost of hiring staff on a termly or permanent basis .
central and local government need to get a grip on the situation if they are to convince us that they have the best interests of our children at heart .
anon , london , uk they do nothing to retain experienced teachers duncan , uk the government makes a big deal of getting new teachers into the system but they do nothing to retain experienced teachers .
why ?
because new recruits are cheaper to employ , you can get two new recruits for the same salary as a very experienced teacher .
this government does n't care about the welfare of our children .
if they did they would want continuity in the education system , not the cheapest option .
duncan , uk we are supposed to be the fourth richest economy in the world and yet we still ca n't value education .
where does it say that falling pupil numbers means that you have to lose a teacher ?
maybe you could have smaller class sizes ?

secondary schools have lost almost 3,500 teaching posts in this year 's funding crisis , a survey suggests .
the times educational supplement says head teachers have had to make redundancies and ca n't afford to replace teachers who 've left their jobs .
the government has dismissed the survey , saying that not enough schools were questioned to make it representative -lrb- 480 head teachers were polled -rrb- .
instead , the government blames the cuts on falling pupil numbers , rather than budget shortages of up to £ 500,000 suffered by many schools .
is there a teacher shortage in your school ?
do schools deserve more money ?
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : it would n't do harm for teachers to take a pay freeze .
there are numerous teachers where i live , in a commuter belt village , with their expensive houses , brand new cars and umpteen holidays per year - and they make us think they 're low paid ?
brian , lancashire , uk the government should be forced to publish the numbers of real teachers at the " chalk face " versus the numbers of administrators , advisors , co-ordinators , special projects , planners -lrb- ! -rrb- and various other money wasters employed in all the various departments that are associated with education .
then we see where all the money goes .
this problem is n't one of lack of money , its one of wasted money .
john r smith , uk i work for an inner london borough which currently has an education ' hiring freeze ' .
this has been in operation for at least six months now and has meant that all support service staff have to be hired on a supply basis , with payments to agencies which must have exceeded the cost of hiring staff on a termly or permanent basis .
central and local government need to get a grip on the situation if they are to convince us that they have the best interests of our children at heart .
anon , london , uk they do nothing to retain experienced teachers duncan , uk the government makes a big deal of getting new teachers into the system but they do nothing to retain experienced teachers .
why ?
because new recruits are cheaper to employ , you can get two new recruits for the same salary as a very experienced teacher .
this government does n't care about the welfare of our children .
if they did they would want continuity in the education system , not the cheapest option .
duncan , uk we are supposed to be the fourth richest economy in the world and yet we still ca n't value education .
where does it say that falling pupil numbers means that you have to lose a teacher ?
maybe you could have smaller class sizes ?
we have 39 in our year 5/6 class next year .
how are we supposed to provide all of them with a decent quality education ?
robin duckworth , uk my wife is a classroom assistant who has recently had to undertake a lot of training though she gets very low pay .
the fact is that there are too few teachers and cash is not reaching the schools .
the government will say that according to their statistics they have the right number of teachers for the future but that is not now .
tony , welling , kent everyone seems to harp on about lack of teachers , and in particular the chaos that this will cause in the future ...
i find it hard to believe that the number of teachers will persist in being a problem going forward because so many people seem to be signing up for teacher training !
loads of my mates are doing it ...
i would n't have the patience myself !
stu , uk yes there is a shortage in the school i work in .
every year we are a few teachers down and we have to rely on long term supply which is more costly .
we are in the red by nearly £ 400,000 and its all due to staff wages .
the government needs to put more money into the schools where it matters .
chris ashbey , uk take all the money and give it to the schools john r smith , uk get " big government " off the backs of the schools ! !
take all the money spent on the dept of education , the leas , all various funding committees and talking shops and give it to the schools .
let the headteachers pay whatever they feel is right to get the staff they need and the facilities to go with them .
once pay is up to professional standards the right numbers of high quality recruits will follow .
the current system is a money wasting failure .
john r smith , uk for years the teaching unions lobbied for changes in the way that teachers were treated , they wanted to be paid for every ' extra ' carried out , supervision of mealtimes , playtimes , etc .
now that teachers are being treated as the hourly paid workers they wished to become everyone is surprised .
barry p , england the times research is probably correct .
in which case , the economic state of the country worries me even more .
if we ca n't competitively prepare our future workers for the global economy , then where does that leave the uk in the future ?
david boiardi , uk you have to be a masochist to become a teacher these days vish , uk of course there is .
let 's face it , you have to be a masochist to become a teacher these days .
low pay , unruly kids , even more unruly parents , everyone tries to blame the world 's ills on you and no matter how hard you work people are still not happy .
i have the utmost respect for all teachers in this country but i do encourage every single last one of them to stick two fingers up to the government and to the public who give them such a hard time and get higher paid jobs in the private sector .
vish , uk surely the reason why schools have less money is the soaring cost of maintaining the extremely expensive teachers ' final salary pension scheme ?
a firefighter friend told me that the fire service have the same problem - the pension scheme costs so much to run that many brigades ca n't afford to buy new vehicles .
helen , england i believe that like other public establishments like hospitals the money is there but it is where it is being spent that is the issue .
when i was in secondary school they were always advertising the fact they had purchased several new computers - but us kids never saw them as they were for the school office .
staff rooms would be improved but the classrooms would be falling down around our ears .
sarah , uk sarah , uk ... you have no idea of the poor conditions teachers work under .
half the time , kids only have resources in the classroom because teachers buy them themselves .
my wife spent £ 40 on teaching resource books yesterday and she 's not paid a salary which justifies that kind of personal expense .
be grateful of what you received and do n't assume it comes from thin air .
ian bartlett , uk the school does not expect to be able to afford to keep me on if the funding levels are not increased next year philip edwards , england having worked as a supply teacher for a few years , i decided to get a full time post this year .
in somerset , it has been very difficult for many teachers to find posts , as there are few positions available - many schools simply can not afford to replace teachers they are losing .
i have managed to get a job - but it 's only a one year contract and the school does not expect to be able to afford to keep me on if the funding levels are not increased next year .
if i go , that would mean class sizes of at least 36 next year .
whilst working on supply , i have been in staff meetings where heads have told their staff they were facing shortfalls of upwards of £ 250,000 ; and job cuts were to be expected .
i know of no head teachers who can comfortably afford to increase classroom assistant levels , as they are supposed to under the new ' workforce agreement ' there is no doubt in my mind that schools have not received anywhere near enough money to run effectively this year .
philip edwards , england i believe the government is pumping money in at the top , and i believe the schools when they say they do not have enough .
somewhere in between there is a big black hole , it costs the taxpayer billions , and our children pay for it with a poorer education .
it is about time that all schools were funded directly and lea 's removed from the picture .
i have every confidence that schools could be trusted far more than the lea 's to use their budget wisely .
too much politicising of education happens at council level , and too much waste of precious resource .
pete , uk speaking as an ex-teacher , there 's another factor that has n't been mentioned here ie people just do n't want to be teachers any more .
it 's become a low-paid , low-status job .
to make matters worse , the pupils have absolutely no respect whatsoever for you .
on the contrary , they treat you with contempt and there 's nothing you can do about it .
the parents give you no support and just try to undermine your position still further .
i got out of the teaching profession years ago , trebled my salary and have never looked back .
wild horses would n't drag me back to teaching in the state sector !
anon -lrb- ex-teacher -rrb- , uk my redundancy took place because of budget shortfall coupled with falling pupil number cath rhodes , uk i am a teacher who has been made redundant , however i taught in a primary school .
i know that in the city where i work there have been at least 45 redundancies , but most of those teachers have been redeployed into alternative teaching posts within the city .
my redundancy took place because of budget shortfall coupled with falling pupil numbers .
the school i taught in will also have a budget shortfall at the end of the new academic year , so redundancy may happen again .
schools definitely deserve much more money than they are allocated .
cath rhodes , uk its not a funding crisis that causes the teachers to go , its the inability to teach the kids that makes them go .
lack of cash covers this up nicely .
i have a few teacher friends and they are totally disheartened by having to teach kids who know that they ca n't be disciplined for bad behaviour because they ' know their rights ' and take advantage of it .
steve g , uk either we want to educate our children or we do n't - it 's as simple as that and heaven help us if we choose the latter !
the government should try for once being honest about how much extra money is really available for schools .
whatever extra money it has put into education the chancellor has ensured that his ni increases for employer and employee have ensured a vast chunk of the additional money is immediately going back to the treasury .
john , uk my mother and sister are teachers , my neighbour is a teacher , 2 of my housemates are training to be teachers -lrb- or soon will be -rrb- , 2 of my friends now want to be teachers .
if there is a shortage , it has nothing to do with people not wanting to do it .
it must be down to the government not giving schools enough money to be able to afford to pay them to teach .

secondary schools have lost almost 3,500 teaching posts in this year 's funding crisis , a survey suggests .
the times educational supplement says head teachers have had to make redundancies and ca n't afford to replace teachers who 've left their jobs .
the government has dismissed the survey , saying that not enough schools were questioned to make it representative -lrb- 480 head teachers were polled -rrb- .
instead , the government blames the cuts on falling pupil numbers , rather than budget shortages of up to £ 500,000 suffered by many schools .
is there a teacher shortage in your school ?
do schools deserve more money ?
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : it would n't do harm for teachers to take a pay freeze .
there are numerous teachers where i live , in a commuter belt village , with their expensive houses , brand new cars and umpteen holidays per year - and they make us think they 're low paid ?
brian , lancashire , uk the government should be forced to publish the numbers of real teachers at the " chalk face " versus the numbers of administrators , advisors , co-ordinators , special projects , planners -lrb- ! -rrb- and various other money wasters employed in all the various departments that are associated with education .
then we see where all the money goes .
this problem is n't one of lack of money , its one of wasted money .
john r smith , uk i work for an inner london borough which currently has an education ' hiring freeze ' .
this has been in operation for at least six months now and has meant that all support service staff have to be hired on a supply basis , with payments to agencies which must have exceeded the cost of hiring staff on a termly or permanent basis .
central and local government need to get a grip on the situation if they are to convince us that they have the best interests of our children at heart .
anon , london , uk they do nothing to retain experienced teachers duncan , uk the government makes a big deal of getting new teachers into the system but they do nothing to retain experienced teachers .
why ?
because new recruits are cheaper to employ , you can get two new recruits for the same salary as a very experienced teacher .
this government does n't care about the welfare of our children .
if they did they would want continuity in the education system , not the cheapest option .
duncan , uk we are supposed to be the fourth richest economy in the world and yet we still ca n't value education .
where does it say that falling pupil numbers means that you have to lose a teacher ?
maybe you could have smaller class sizes ?
we have 39 in our year 5/6 class next year .
how are we supposed to provide all of them with a decent quality education ?
robin duckworth , uk my wife is a classroom assistant who has recently had to undertake a lot of training though she gets very low pay .
the fact is that there are too few teachers and cash is not reaching the schools .
the government will say that according to their statistics they have the right number of teachers for the future but that is not now .
tony , welling , kent everyone seems to harp on about lack of teachers , and in particular the chaos that this will cause in the future ...
i find it hard to believe that the number of teachers will persist in being a problem going forward because so many people seem to be signing up for teacher training !
loads of my mates are doing it ...
i would n't have the patience myself !
stu , uk yes there is a shortage in the school i work in .
every year we are a few teachers down and we have to rely on long term supply which is more costly .
we are in the red by nearly £ 400,000 and its all due to staff wages .
the government needs to put more money into the schools where it matters .
chris ashbey , uk take all the money and give it to the schools john r smith , uk get " big government " off the backs of the schools ! !
take all the money spent on the dept of education , the leas , all various funding committees and talking shops and give it to the schools .
let the headteachers pay whatever they feel is right to get the staff they need and the facilities to go with them .
once pay is up to professional standards the right numbers of high quality recruits will follow .
the current system is a money wasting failure .
john r smith , uk for years the teaching unions lobbied for changes in the way that teachers were treated , they wanted to be paid for every ' extra ' carried out , supervision of mealtimes , playtimes , etc .
now that teachers are being treated as the hourly paid workers they wished to become everyone is surprised .
barry p , england the times research is probably correct .
in which case , the economic state of the country worries me even more .
if we ca n't competitively prepare our future workers for the global economy , then where does that leave the uk in the future ?
david boiardi , uk you have to be a masochist to become a teacher these days vish , uk of course there is .
let 's face it , you have to be a masochist to become a teacher these days .
low pay , unruly kids , even more unruly parents , everyone tries to blame the world 's ills on you and no matter how hard you work people are still not happy .
i have the utmost respect for all teachers in this country but i do encourage every single last one of them to stick two fingers up to the government and to the public who give them such a hard time and get higher paid jobs in the private sector .
vish , uk surely the reason why schools have less money is the soaring cost of maintaining the extremely expensive teachers ' final salary pension scheme ?
a firefighter friend told me that the fire service have the same problem - the pension scheme costs so much to run that many brigades ca n't afford to buy new vehicles .
helen , england i believe that like other public establishments like hospitals the money is there but it is where it is being spent that is the issue .
when i was in secondary school they were always advertising the fact they had purchased several new computers - but us kids never saw them as they were for the school office .
staff rooms would be improved but the classrooms would be falling down around our ears .
sarah , uk sarah , uk ... you have no idea of the poor conditions teachers work under .
half the time , kids only have resources in the classroom because teachers buy them themselves .
my wife spent £ 40 on teaching resource books yesterday and she 's not paid a salary which justifies that kind of personal expense .
be grateful of what you received and do n't assume it comes from thin air .
ian bartlett , uk the school does not expect to be able to afford to keep me on if the funding levels are not increased next year philip edwards , england having worked as a supply teacher for a few years , i decided to get a full time post this year .
in somerset , it has been very difficult for many teachers to find posts , as there are few positions available - many schools simply can not afford to replace teachers they are losing .
i have managed to get a job - but it 's only a one year contract and the school does not expect to be able to afford to keep me on if the funding levels are not increased next year .
if i go , that would mean class sizes of at least 36 next year .
whilst working on supply , i have been in staff meetings where heads have told their staff they were facing shortfalls of upwards of £ 250,000 ; and job cuts were to be expected .
i know of no head teachers who can comfortably afford to increase classroom assistant levels , as they are supposed to under the new ' workforce agreement ' there is no doubt in my mind that schools have not received anywhere near enough money to run effectively this year .
philip edwards , england i believe the government is pumping money in at the top , and i believe the schools when they say they do not have enough .
somewhere in between there is a big black hole , it costs the taxpayer billions , and our children pay for it with a poorer education .
it is about time that all schools were funded directly and lea 's removed from the picture .

more than 130 others have been injured , many seriously according to the police and hospital reports .
the indian authorities say they are linking bomb explosions to continuing religious tensions in the state of gujarat .
one of the blasts happened near the historic gateway of india monument , a crowded tourist attraction in the heart of the city .
the other explosion occurred near a hindu temple in a busy market area of mumbai .
have you been affected by the explosions ?
send us your reactions to the blasts .
the following comments reflect the balance of views we have received : this debate is now closed .
read your comments below .
your reaction : the muslim-hindu secular problem are merely a symptom of a much deeper problem in india -lrb- and , for that matter , pakistan and bangladesh -rrb- .
various indian governments have , through the years , tried various appeasement techniques when dealing with inter-community issues , instead of applying one law for everyone in the country ... which is what " secular " really means .
the proliferation of islamic terrorist groups worldwide has made it almost impossible to keep such disputes strictly within the country , as they are seized upon by such terrorist groups , who exploit the fears of ordinary muslims .
rustam roy , england -lrb- ex-india -rrb- tragedy !
how do these extremists expect to achieve their goals by slaughtering innocent people .
mumbai is a long way from kashmir !
nobody wants another palestine ...
obviously both sides have taken lives , but this cycle will not lead to an independent kashmir .
werner , germany those who would like to place the blame of terrorism on the us in general , and pres bush in particular are missing a bit of history .
terrorism has been " alive and well " as a form of social revolt since the evolution of civilization .
while i agree that bush has made an impact in the geopolitical realm , he no more caused terrorism than dan quale invented the internet .
sandra , us it 's deplorable that already politicians have started pointed fingers at other countries and blaming each other .
why , for once , after such a horrific disaster , ca n't the politicians put their agendas aside and stand together .
why ca n't they show the public the leadership that 's now required .
why must they make differences ?
the indian public , the mumbai public need to stand together , and force any politician who tries to force his / her agendas out of this tragedy , to stand down !
my condolences to those affected .
peace to india .
ali , united kingdom neither a temple nor a mosque built on the disputed site will solve this issue .
hindus and muslims have to come together and donate the land for building a charity house or a hospital for the poor .
this will show the world real unity and strength lies in helping the needy and not fighting over the name of religion or god .
my heartfelt condolences to the victims .
prakash , usa this is deplorable .
mumbai has to once again bear the brunt .
our incapable leaders find a good scapegoat in pakistan .
i just hope this does not create panic within the citizens and mumbai shows its true spirit of being the strongest city in india .
adnan , uk the main weapon to derail such groups will be to make them irrelevant by political action arvind , india these kinds of attacks are impossible to prevent .
police intelligence could prevent some , but most will succeed given the peculiar socio-economic conditions prevailing in third world .
does this mean there is nothing that could be done ?
no , there would be actions that can be taken , including swift justice to guilty and more thorough intelligence , but the main weapon to derail such groups will be to make them irrelevant by political action , economic forces and by public outcry .
witness the speed with which mumbai resumed normal operations .
arvind , india the muslim community in india can set an example to the rest of the world , by donating the land for building a temple in ayodhya .
by this action , they will not only forever bury the ghosts of communal strife in india , but will also demonstrate to the world that islam is a magnanimous religion and not a fundamental religion .
the hindus on their part can show their magnanimity by donating the land for building a large hospital for the poor .
god dwells in the minds and heart of people , and would not want to dwell in a temple or mosque which is built from the blood and tears of humans .
sarat menon , india there is no question , there is an international element which has as its goal the destruction of anything which is not in agreement with some of the islamic fundamentalists .
these individuals , who are bent to destruct the very basic infra-structures civilized man has built , must be stopped .
religious fundamentalism of any religion must be scrutinized and its leaders closely guarded .
the fact that the west permits israel to occupy arab lands has caused a major backlash against everything closely linked to the us .
it may be a co-incidence that most bombings and other terrorist activities started when bush jnr came to power !
harry promm , canada while we should wait for the investigations to get to the bottom of the bombings , i 'd like to bring up the double standards india faces in its war on terrorism .
when attacks occur on israeli or american targets , they 're able to retaliate forcefully .
but a similar action by india would be condemned by the world community .
the terrorist policy of bleeding india will never work ... just witness the queues of blood donors that formed immediately after the bombings .
one would think that years of relentless but unsuccessful terrorist attacks would drive home the point that democracies such as india are meant to last because they 're inherently based on a solid foundation .
kj , us now is the time for all indians to display their famed religious tolerance sarat menon , india now is the time for all indians to display their famed religious tolerance .
politicians and rabble rousers will use this opportunity to stoke communal flames of hatred among the hindu 's .
all indian 's must desist from falling into this obvious trap and show the world that we are truly the most tolerant , multi-religious country in the world .
throughout the world , mahatma gandhi 's name is synonymous with non-violence and it is time that india carried forth this message again to the entire world .
sarat menon , india the indian political leadership is surely to blame for this attack .
instead of taking a bi-partisan approach to solve sensitive issues like ayodhya and gujrat , indian politicians have always tried to take political mileage out of such incidents ; india comes first and then political parties .
get to work and arrest / kill the culprits regardless of their religious affiliation .
make political agendas based on economics , education and foreign policies , not at the cost of people 's lives .
who 's listening ?
sj , usa despite the panic caused by these atrocious bomb blasts the people of mumbai kept their heads on their shoulders .
help was at hand for everyone from everyone ; the local people and the police too .
the local people rushed out to hospitals donate blood as soon as the news spread .
kudos to this spirit of mumbai !
it only goes to show that the communal hatred is not an issue with common people .
god bless .
chitra , india / uk it 's a tragedy that this has happened in the midst of the peace talks ian , uk it 's a tragedy that this has happened in the midst of the peace talks .
i think we should not play into the hands of these mindless extremists who wish to throw everyone into a state of chaos .
i think the peace talks need to continue .
my sincere condolences to anyone who has been affected by the blasts .
god bless india .
ian , uk we have the best chance for 50 years of having a lasting peace between india and pakistan .
let 's not point fingers and bomb people willy-nilly .
bbc2 showed gandhi over the weekend , and it reaffirmed my belief that fighting fire with fire just causes more fire .
his stance of fighting the british by peaceful means bought about the fall of the greatest empire the world has seen .
it 's all too easy to get violent with these despicable terrorists who are deplored by muslims the world over .
let 's go back to gandhi 's stance , hindus and muslims unite and stand in the face of terror together and fight it peacefully .
ali , united kingdom i think these explosions are in retaliation to the riots that occurred with tacit official complicity in gujarat .
this cycle of violence will continue until india elects responsible politicians to public office .
v nandakumar , india in the land of mahatma gandhi it is indeed shocking that such religious extremism , of both the hindu and muslim variety , has been allowed to propagate to such an extent .
there can be no question of india turning into a hindu rashtra , this situation would be the death of india as we know it .
i pray hindus can show tolerance and forgiveness for this attack , and appreciate that , unlike other nations , that this act signifies problems that exist between communities in our own country and an introspective look at our inter-religious relationships is needed .
i also hope it remembers that an eye for an eye can only turn the world blind .
raj thapar , uk having lived in bombay in the 60s and 70s , and later on in the middle 80s , and loved the city , i feel sorry that these things have started to happen , but this is reality and we in india have to brace up to it .
cry my beautiful city .
h.k.das , india i just want to say how appalled and sickened i am by this recent terrorist outrage mo shah , birmingham being a kashmiri and pakistani i just want to say how appalled and sickened i am by this recent terrorist outrage .
like india , pakistan is also a victim of terrorism .
as the quetta mosque massacre will testify .
these cowardly terrorists are just out to derail the peace process .
let india and pakistan work together towards peace and unity .
do n't let these murderers have their way .
both india and pakistan have so much to look forward too .
let 's not play into the hands of these individuals .
mo shah , birmingham very sad to see and hear the plight of secular country like india going through such a situation .
my sincere grief to all the family who lost the innocent members meanwhile let us re-think about the politicians who brought india to such a drastic and pathetic situation .
remember we all are one as indians not as any religious personalities .
let us remove all communalism from our mind and live harmoniously .
let our political leaders also live and instigate our people accordingly .
pappy george , kuwait life is life ; it 's no different in bombay or in new york .
life should not be made cheaper from one place to other .
imagine the strongest country would do if such an incident happens on its commercial capital .
indian government must act tough and it should punish all those who had involved in killing those innocent lives and attempting to ignite instability around the country .
god bless india .
srikanth , india , usa yet again muslim extremists target innocent civilians and yet again muslims everywhere fail to state their unqualified condemnation of these people .
how can anyone support or believe in a religion that breeds such hatred of other creeds .
pam malarry , uk when such a thing happens in israel , israel retaliates and kills terrorist leaders from helicopters .
why does n't india do the same ?
by not taking any action , they encourage more terrorism .
india and israel are infected with the same virus .
the world should join hands and recognise the need for a real global fight against terrorism .
justice for the dead please .
prahlad , usa the extremists fear the rapprochement between india and pakistan j thakrar , usa stay the course .
the extremists fear the rapprochement between india and pakistan .
bend over backwards before blaming average indian muslim : see the victim list !
all are indians before they are hindus or muslims !
j thakrar , usa the killings of innocent civilians are highly condemnable ; either it happens in bombay , in gujrat or in kashmir .
i think social justice and tolerance can decrease such tragic incidents .
my hearty condolences to those who lost their loved ones .
saif ullah , pakistan my sympathies with the people of mumbai , who did nothing , as individuals , or as a nation , to justify this outrage .
this , and the un bombing last week , bring into focus the truth - terrorists will always find a " perceived wrong " to justify their atrocities .
our answer must be to go after the terrorists , rather than fool ourselves into thinking we can correct these " wrongs " .
daniel , israel let 's just pray india does n't react the way america did after 9/11 by bombing more innocent people .
nothing justifies such a blatant massacre .
ahmed , uk this explosion has raised two concerns : the retaliation against indian muslims , and against pakistan .
whatever occurs in india or pakistan , it is always the other country that is blamed .
even though this is the time to mourn the deaths of so many , i feel we have more carnage in store under the umbrella of " revenge " .
hamza sheikh , usa i am a resident of mumbai .
i am totally shocked by these incidents and strongly condemn this cowardly act of terrorism but # i request to all fellow citizens of mumbai and india that for god 's sake please do n't stage any " bandhs " as it will only serve the purpose of the coward terrorists to destabilise the country .
deepak sankhla , india i do n't know if tomorrow can be a normal day kaushik vishwakarma , mumbai / india it was really a shock when in the afternoon we hared about the blast in our office .
suddenly everyone starts calling their dear ones to find their wellbeing and the telephone line gets overloaded .
it seemed the terrorists knew the result of the asi -lrb- archeological survey of india -rrb- report and were just waiting for this moment .
i do n't know if tomorrow can be a normal day .
kaushik vishwakarma , mumbai / india act of terrorism , should be condemned whether it happens in pakistan , india or elsewhere .
india and pakistan should work together to get rid of these acts , and if it is home-grown we should nip that evil sooner than later .
may god , the almighty bless the innocents who are dead in this act of cowardice .
ehson , pakistan / canada this was a highly condemnable act , a great tragedy .
i hope that the terrorists behind this are caught and brought to justice .
i also hope that this does not trigger any tensions between hindus and muslims .
mumbai thrives on business ; hopefully that attitude will ensure its survival .
kiran , india once again india has become the victim of a nefarious terrorist attack .
i wonder when we in the west will stop applying double standards to terrorism - evil when it hurts our interests , and self-inflicted in the case of countries like india .
whatever became of mr. bush 's famed " international coalition against terrorism " ?
sven larsson , sweden blast like these will not stop the die hard bombaities to go on with their life .
as india goes on the path to be globally strong , politically and economically , more and more terrorists and acts like these will try to act as a hurdle in the path of success .
and as usual ...
bombay will stand up on its feet and " rise again " .
clyde joseph , india as long as terrorism and suicide bombing wont be condemned by the entire world , it will continue to be legitimized way of combat by eyes of few distorted persons , and the results are dead civilians and diminish of trust between humans .
terrorism and suicide bombing should be labelled as crime against humanity , without exception , this is true in bombay as in baghdad and in jerusalem .
uri d , israel yes i got affected .
this is an act of terrorism , killing innocent people .
i can say truth will prevail , whoever is he , he has to pay for it .
people who kill innocents ca n't be freedom fighters , they are only devils. and those who name them as a freedom fighter , they are big devils .
god bless my lovely india .
sridhar , india why do n't their leaders become wise enough to convince their people that this issue is not worth so many lives m. ali abbas , usa , pakistan why do n't these people make a mosque and a temple side by side ?
why do n't their leaders become wise enough to convince their people that this issue is not worth so many lives that have been and would be wasted in this ridiculous cause ?
m. ali abbas , usa , pakistan explosions in mumbai are quite often these days .
when i heard about today 's explosions i was stunned as target people are either devotes or tourists .
some of them were thrown in to sea because of the explosion .
i lived in mumbai it is very difficult in identifying who has done this .
the underworld of mumbai is closely netted with terrorist groups .
today 's incident comes at the time of asi -lrb- archaeological society of india -rrb- report of some temple structures beneath grounded babri masjid which can make a case of temple building at the site .
i pray god to give the strength to the relatives of the victims .
prakash bharatam , germany / india with pakistan moving swiftly to condemn this bombing , it can only be hoped that a positive outcome will be a constructive dialogue between india and pakistan , removing the leverage for self interested groups to play them off against each other .
barry b , uk terrorist attacks have come to be a part of our lives mon chandy , india one has to consider the terrorist attacks similar to road and rail accidents , earthquakes and other natural disasters , because it has come to be a part of our lives .
a couple of decades back these events were rare , but today it is a daily occurrence .
it is the highest priority for the news media and gets wide coverage .
thus meeting the very objectives of those indulging in these wanton killings mon chandy , india these kind of acts are to condemned but while considering the gujarath incident this is nothing .
anilkumar , liberia for building temple or mosque , innocent people are getting killed .
god never say to do this unwanted idiocy .
tajammul , india let 's wait for the results of the investigations .
no one should se charged till the end of the investigations .
antonio souza , india 8 blasts in as many months is just too much to deal for any city in the world .
it is time the government act more seriously in eliminating such attacks on civilians .
i hope these blasts wo n't lead to any more sectarian clashes .
god bless india .
vamsi , india -lrb- from hungary -rrb- really it is sad for all who lost their beloved ones .
it is every one 's responsibility to fight against terror who ever it may be which ever the country it be , by god 's grace there , we will pray there will not be such incidents in future .
murugesan , jeddah i think it 's a wake up call for india to act tough .
hari , usa this is a terrible tragedy , inhuman and condemnable by all peace loving people of the world rajeev jacob , kuwait baffling : definitely handiwork of religious fanatics as barbri masjid-ram temple dispute unfolds .
why india , pakistan are set to destroy each other ?
berlin wall is down and its time for india-pakistan-bangladesh to come together for humanity needs a better deal .
tito , greece is ayodya a place for worship or an altar of sacrifice for the gods to feed on the blood of innocent lives ?
anonymous , india in their quest to build a place of worship -lrb- hindu or muslim -rrb- innocent lives are lost .
is ayodya a place for worship or an altar of sacrifice for the gods to feed on the blood of innocent lives ?
is it worth building a temple or a mosque after so many deaths . the gods must indeed be cruel to demand such a huge sacrifice for their glory ! !
anonymous , india indian government should take necessary steps to catch the culprits and bring them to justice .
if some countries and harbouring those terrorists they have to pressurise them to hand them over , just like what usa did after 9/11 .
mahesh sharma , canada i feel that this was a very sad thing to happen ! !
just when we see the city growing and people treating each other with respect it crumbles in this way , i feel we should fight against this and put an end to terrorism .
merzi , dubai uae it 's unfortunate , that india started witnessing the same situation as in israel and palestine where both the sides have decided to fight each other till they see the light at the end of the tunnel .
mohan , india not more than a week or so ago i was staying in the taj mahal hotel overlooking the ' gateway to india ' and the independence day celebrations in front of it with kids chasing the multitudes of pigeons and people generally having a good time .
now it 's the scene of death and destruction . how very , very sad .
richard , dubai , u.a.e. if this blast is related to the ayodha temple site issue then it is a shame that people have to die for the building of a temple or a mosque -lrb- whatever they decide to build there -rrb- .
why do n't they build a school or a hospital there which both hindus & muslims can use rather than just fighting over a piece of land .
sadiq parker , kuwait i feel very sad for those who lost their loved ones in the blast .
we should be united at this point of time and pray for peace .
janaki rama raju , india it is completely unnerving to even think of the victims of the blast ujwal makhija , india creating panic by terrorising and killing innocent people is the worst way to make any point on any issue whatsoever .
not only should the blast be condemned , but also made sure that such people are not lost in the tentacles of a painfully slow judicial system .
the culprits should be made to pay maximum penalty for such shameful acts of cowardice .
it is completely unnerving to even think of the victims of the blast .
ujwal makhija , india i sincerely hope that these latest series of bomb blasts , do not provoke wide spread retaliation against the muslim community .
wiser counsel has prevailed in similar such recent occasions , and the normally pragmatic mumbaikar should do well not to fall in to the trap laid by the nefarious forces , which are intent on tearing apart the nations secular fabric .
sarat menon , india every bomb , and every death , irrecoverably scars us all .
