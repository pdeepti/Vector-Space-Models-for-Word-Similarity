less known , but equally impressive , is the city 's flourishing arts scene . frankfurt am main may be the city 's official name but it 's often referred to as bankfurt or mainhattan .
that 's hardly surprising : the city has more than 40 gleaming skyscrapers , the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world -lrb- the börse -rrb- and 400 banking institutions , including the european central bank - home of the euro and all things monetary .
frankfurt also has the second largest airport in europe and hosts some of the largest trade fairs in the world , including the frankfurt book fair .
it 's no wonder that most people who come here are on business . what , unfortunately , goes unnoticed by the passers-through is the city 's incredible art scene .
spurred by critics who said this financial capital lacked a cultural soul , wealthy locals poured money into the arts , funding a mini museum-building boom in the early 90 's .
this medium-sized city of 650,000 spends more money per year on the arts - up to 10 percent of the city budget - than paris , london or any other major city in europe .
and even if the airport is all you see , there 's an art gallery there as well . along with the power-house museums , an independent gallery scene has cropped up , giving the city a respectable alternative edge and acting as a counterweight to the suits and ties and creating a bohemian oasis in a capitalist desert . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank headquarters the ' main ' part of frankfurt 's name comes from the river that bisects the city running east to west .
the north half could be chicago 's sister city with its sky-high glass towers marking the metropolitan banking and business sector .
among the towers leading the skyline is the commerzbank building -lrb- photo -rrb- .
completed in 1997 , it was designed by sir norman foster , who also gave the reichstag parliament building a facelift in berlin . the bustling banking center does n't go to sleep at the end of business hours , but buzzes well into the night - until the stock exchange bell rings in new york five hours later . things are a little more relaxed outside of the concrete jungle , down towards the river in römerberg , the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- district .
in extreme contrast to the banking area , römerberg has some of the only remaining medieval and historically significant buildings in the city that survived allied bombing during world war ii .
german democracy was born in paulskirche , where the first constitution was written in the middle of the 19th century .
the kaiserdom , an imperial cathedral , is where ten german emperors and kings were crowned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann wolfgang von goethe , the father of modern german literature , was born in frankfurt almost 250 years ago , and his timber-framed house -lrb- open to tourists -rrb- - where he penned the sorrows of young werther and faust - is also just minutes away from the altstadt . museum embankment just a short walk across the historical eiserner steg bridge to the other side of the main river brings one to the cultural promenade dubbed the museum embankment -lrb- museumsufer -rrb- .
ten years ago ' frankfurt ' was n't mentioned in the same breath as " fine art , " but things have since changed dramatically .
after a thorough remodelling and expansion under the guidance of architect johannes krahn , the 125-year-old städelsches kunstinstitut -lrb- städel art institute -rrb- reopened in 1999 as the city 's flagship for classical painting and sculpture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helene arendt the städel houses an impressive collection of works by van eyck , rubens , vermeer and others . the museum for modern art is another noteworthy new addition to the city .
completed in 1991 , the triangular modern structure was designed by austrian-born architect hans hollein and displays a modern collection , including roy lichtenstein , claes oldenburg and joseph beuys . the endless list of cultural highlights - frankfurt has over 40 museums in all - includes a communications museum , museum of applied arts , jewish museum and the german museum of film .
but frankfurt 's flourishing cultural scene extends beyond its powerhouse museums . the money flowing through the city nourished a cultural renaissance during the late ' 80s , bringing with it a new ballet company under the direction of american choreographer william forsythe , the künstlerhaus mousonturm , which exhibits interdisciplinary art , as well as the portikus gallery and the mak frankfurt center for art and design .
in a nod to the city 's cultural advances , the organizers of the manifesta art show chose the city to host their fourth event in 2001 .
a number of world-class galleries also came into prominence in the city 's altstadt in the area surrounding the schirn kunsthalle and the römerberg . sachsenhausen , west of the museumsufer , along the schaumainkai , is a great place to grab some food and drink after a long day of contemplating art .
here you have a choice : turn eastwards towards schweizer strasse lined with its bistros , posh cafés and trendy shops ; or head west towards alt-sachsenhausen where things get a bit more burly .
this is a great area to try frankfurt 's finest - ebbelwoi -lrb- apple wine -rrb- or " handkäse mit musik , " a local specialty of picked cheese and onions . nightlife a good place to start off the evening is at any of the apple wine taverns throughout the city .
with close to 48,000 students in frankfurt -lrb- not to mention the artists -rrb- , the city really comes alive at the dance and music clubs , especially after a couple of glasses of ebbelwoi .
some of the best places are located along the streets surrounding the northern part of the city center at the fressgasse and zeil . to the south , the römerberg and sachsenhausen offer abundant dining and nightlife opportunities .
berger strasse in frankfurt 's bornheim district is home to a thriving bar , restaurant and café scene , where you are as likely to bump into young flight attendants from lufthansa as you are up-and-coming bankers in their casual weekend wear . events frankfurt kicks off the year with the pre-lent fastnacht parades , then moves into the international music trade fair in march , followed by the international jazz festival and the fitting " skyscraper festival " in may .

the world 's largest book fair , founded in 1480 , takes place in october . five frankfurt must-sees : banking district most of frankfurt 's major financial houses are closed to the public , but it 's worth taking a quick walking tour through the city to see some of europe 's most spectacular skyscrapers .

less known , but equally impressive , is the city 's flourishing arts scene . frankfurt am main may be the city 's official name but it 's often referred to as bankfurt or mainhattan .
that 's hardly surprising : the city has more than 40 gleaming skyscrapers , the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world -lrb- the börse -rrb- and 400 banking institutions , including the european central bank - home of the euro and all things monetary .
frankfurt also has the second largest airport in europe and hosts some of the largest trade fairs in the world , including the frankfurt book fair .
it 's no wonder that most people who come here are on business . what , unfortunately , goes unnoticed by the passers-through is the city 's incredible art scene .
spurred by critics who said this financial capital lacked a cultural soul , wealthy locals poured money into the arts , funding a mini museum-building boom in the early 90 's .
this medium-sized city of 650,000 spends more money per year on the arts - up to 10 percent of the city budget - than paris , london or any other major city in europe .
and even if the airport is all you see , there 's an art gallery there as well . along with the power-house museums , an independent gallery scene has cropped up , giving the city a respectable alternative edge and acting as a counterweight to the suits and ties and creating a bohemian oasis in a capitalist desert . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank headquarters the ' main ' part of frankfurt 's name comes from the river that bisects the city running east to west .
the north half could be chicago 's sister city with its sky-high glass towers marking the metropolitan banking and business sector .
among the towers leading the skyline is the commerzbank building -lrb- photo -rrb- .
completed in 1997 , it was designed by sir norman foster , who also gave the reichstag parliament building a facelift in berlin . the bustling banking center does n't go to sleep at the end of business hours , but buzzes well into the night - until the stock exchange bell rings in new york five hours later . things are a little more relaxed outside of the concrete jungle , down towards the river in römerberg , the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- district .
in extreme contrast to the banking area , römerberg has some of the only remaining medieval and historically significant buildings in the city that survived allied bombing during world war ii .
german democracy was born in paulskirche , where the first constitution was written in the middle of the 19th century .
the kaiserdom , an imperial cathedral , is where ten german emperors and kings were crowned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann wolfgang von goethe , the father of modern german literature , was born in frankfurt almost 250 years ago , and his timber-framed house -lrb- open to tourists -rrb- - where he penned the sorrows of young werther and faust - is also just minutes away from the altstadt . museum embankment just a short walk across the historical eiserner steg bridge to the other side of the main river brings one to the cultural promenade dubbed the museum embankment -lrb- museumsufer -rrb- .
ten years ago ' frankfurt ' was n't mentioned in the same breath as " fine art , " but things have since changed dramatically .
after a thorough remodelling and expansion under the guidance of architect johannes krahn , the 125-year-old städelsches kunstinstitut -lrb- städel art institute -rrb- reopened in 1999 as the city 's flagship for classical painting and sculpture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helene arendt the städel houses an impressive collection of works by van eyck , rubens , vermeer and others . the museum for modern art is another noteworthy new addition to the city .
completed in 1991 , the triangular modern structure was designed by austrian-born architect hans hollein and displays a modern collection , including roy lichtenstein , claes oldenburg and joseph beuys . the endless list of cultural highlights - frankfurt has over 40 museums in all - includes a communications museum , museum of applied arts , jewish museum and the german museum of film .
but frankfurt 's flourishing cultural scene extends beyond its powerhouse museums . the money flowing through the city nourished a cultural renaissance during the late ' 80s , bringing with it a new ballet company under the direction of american choreographer william forsythe , the künstlerhaus mousonturm , which exhibits interdisciplinary art , as well as the portikus gallery and the mak frankfurt center for art and design .
in a nod to the city 's cultural advances , the organizers of the manifesta art show chose the city to host their fourth event in 2001 .
a number of world-class galleries also came into prominence in the city 's altstadt in the area surrounding the schirn kunsthalle and the römerberg . sachsenhausen , west of the museumsufer , along the schaumainkai , is a great place to grab some food and drink after a long day of contemplating art .
here you have a choice : turn eastwards towards schweizer strasse lined with its bistros , posh cafés and trendy shops ; or head west towards alt-sachsenhausen where things get a bit more burly .
this is a great area to try frankfurt 's finest - ebbelwoi -lrb- apple wine -rrb- or " handkäse mit musik , " a local specialty of picked cheese and onions . nightlife a good place to start off the evening is at any of the apple wine taverns throughout the city .
with close to 48,000 students in frankfurt -lrb- not to mention the artists -rrb- , the city really comes alive at the dance and music clubs , especially after a couple of glasses of ebbelwoi .
some of the best places are located along the streets surrounding the northern part of the city center at the fressgasse and zeil . to the south , the römerberg and sachsenhausen offer abundant dining and nightlife opportunities .
berger strasse in frankfurt 's bornheim district is home to a thriving bar , restaurant and café scene , where you are as likely to bump into young flight attendants from lufthansa as you are up-and-coming bankers in their casual weekend wear . events frankfurt kicks off the year with the pre-lent fastnacht parades , then moves into the international music trade fair in march , followed by the international jazz festival and the fitting " skyscraper festival " in may .
august is a great time to visit frankfurt when the mainfest and the museumsuferfest fill the riverside area with art and apple wine .
the world 's largest book fair , founded in 1480 , takes place in october . five frankfurt must-sees : banking district most of frankfurt 's major financial houses are closed to the public , but it 's worth taking a quick walking tour through the city to see some of europe 's most spectacular skyscrapers .
the most noteworthy are the commerzbank building , at kaiserplatz , deutsche bank 's impressive glass twin towers at taunusanlage 12 and the european central bank , which rises above the city from its perch at kaiserstrasse 29 . the börse the deutsche börse , neue börsenstrasse 1 , is home to germany 's stock exchange and the international dax index .

france sent a reconnaissance team to the former belgian colony over the weekend to scout out the nuts and bolts of a possible troop deployment .
the team met with un officials on sunday in the capital of kinshasa , in the far west of the country , to give their report .
british prime minister tony blair said his government is considering a request by u.n. secretary general kofi annan last week to contribute to a multinational security force .
germany , which has so far pledged no troops , is sending deputy assistant foreign minister kerstin müller on a tour of the region this week to assess the situation . stops include kenya , rwanda , uganda and congo , where she will meet with government officials , aid organizations and u.n. officials to assess the situation .
a spokesperson for the foreign ministry told dw-world germany was taking part in u.n. and european union discussions on a possible multinational force , but would n't say whether the country would take part . " we support the efforts of the u.n. to expand the mandate of the current peacekeepers , " the spokesperson said . kids with guns , town a virtual battleground international military aid could n't come at a more crucial time .

-lrb- ap photo / karel prinsloo -rrb- the town of bunia has been particularly hard hit .
the united nations discovered more than 300 bodies following fighting between the militia , including those of two u.n. observers .
horror photos of children toting ak 47s and dismembered bodies have circulated in the international media . more than 80 percent of the town 's estimated 150,000 residents have fled the town during the two weeks of fighting . the u.n. human rights commissioner fears the fighting could spark a " second rwanda , " yet another inter-ethnic genocide in the region .
already , more than 2.5 million have died during fighting in the unstable republic in recent years , according to the united nations . congo brings instability to the region conflicts between congolese rebels and government troops in the late 1990s , involved soldiers from surrounding uganda , rwanda , angola , namibia , zimbabwe , chad and sudan . though peace pacts and cease fires were signed , it was not until the son of assassinated former rebel leader turned president laurent kabila took power in 2001 that hopes for a long-lasting peace in the central africa region began to materialize . small-time skirmishes continued , but none with the scope of the current conflict . the two warring factions began fighting when ugandan troops withdrew as part of a peace deal earlier this month .

less known , but equally impressive , is the city 's flourishing arts scene . frankfurt am main may be the city 's official name but it 's often referred to as bankfurt or mainhattan .
that 's hardly surprising : the city has more than 40 gleaming skyscrapers , the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world -lrb- the börse -rrb- and 400 banking institutions , including the european central bank - home of the euro and all things monetary .
frankfurt also has the second largest airport in europe and hosts some of the largest trade fairs in the world , including the frankfurt book fair .
it 's no wonder that most people who come here are on business . what , unfortunately , goes unnoticed by the passers-through is the city 's incredible art scene .
spurred by critics who said this financial capital lacked a cultural soul , wealthy locals poured money into the arts , funding a mini museum-building boom in the early 90 's .
this medium-sized city of 650,000 spends more money per year on the arts - up to 10 percent of the city budget - than paris , london or any other major city in europe .
and even if the airport is all you see , there 's an art gallery there as well . along with the power-house museums , an independent gallery scene has cropped up , giving the city a respectable alternative edge and acting as a counterweight to the suits and ties and creating a bohemian oasis in a capitalist desert . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank headquarters the ' main ' part of frankfurt 's name comes from the river that bisects the city running east to west .
the north half could be chicago 's sister city with its sky-high glass towers marking the metropolitan banking and business sector .
among the towers leading the skyline is the commerzbank building -lrb- photo -rrb- .
completed in 1997 , it was designed by sir norman foster , who also gave the reichstag parliament building a facelift in berlin . the bustling banking center does n't go to sleep at the end of business hours , but buzzes well into the night - until the stock exchange bell rings in new york five hours later . things are a little more relaxed outside of the concrete jungle , down towards the river in römerberg , the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- district .
in extreme contrast to the banking area , römerberg has some of the only remaining medieval and historically significant buildings in the city that survived allied bombing during world war ii .
german democracy was born in paulskirche , where the first constitution was written in the middle of the 19th century .
the kaiserdom , an imperial cathedral , is where ten german emperors and kings were crowned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann wolfgang von goethe , the father of modern german literature , was born in frankfurt almost 250 years ago , and his timber-framed house -lrb- open to tourists -rrb- - where he penned the sorrows of young werther and faust - is also just minutes away from the altstadt . museum embankment just a short walk across the historical eiserner steg bridge to the other side of the main river brings one to the cultural promenade dubbed the museum embankment -lrb- museumsufer -rrb- .
ten years ago ' frankfurt ' was n't mentioned in the same breath as " fine art , " but things have since changed dramatically .
after a thorough remodelling and expansion under the guidance of architect johannes krahn , the 125-year-old städelsches kunstinstitut -lrb- städel art institute -rrb- reopened in 1999 as the city 's flagship for classical painting and sculpture .

completed in 1991 , the triangular modern structure was designed by austrian-born architect hans hollein and displays a modern collection , including roy lichtenstein , claes oldenburg and joseph beuys . the endless list of cultural highlights - frankfurt has over 40 museums in all - includes a communications museum , museum of applied arts , jewish museum and the german museum of film .
but frankfurt 's flourishing cultural scene extends beyond its powerhouse museums . the money flowing through the city nourished a cultural renaissance during the late ' 80s , bringing with it a new ballet company under the direction of american choreographer william forsythe , the künstlerhaus mousonturm , which exhibits interdisciplinary art , as well as the portikus gallery and the mak frankfurt center for art and design .
in a nod to the city 's cultural advances , the organizers of the manifesta art show chose the city to host their fourth event in 2001 .
a number of world-class galleries also came into prominence in the city 's altstadt in the area surrounding the schirn kunsthalle and the römerberg . sachsenhausen , west of the museumsufer , along the schaumainkai , is a great place to grab some food and drink after a long day of contemplating art .
here you have a choice : turn eastwards towards schweizer strasse lined with its bistros , posh cafés and trendy shops ; or head west towards alt-sachsenhausen where things get a bit more burly .
this is a great area to try frankfurt 's finest - ebbelwoi -lrb- apple wine -rrb- or " handkäse mit musik , " a local specialty of picked cheese and onions . nightlife a good place to start off the evening is at any of the apple wine taverns throughout the city .
with close to 48,000 students in frankfurt -lrb- not to mention the artists -rrb- , the city really comes alive at the dance and music clubs , especially after a couple of glasses of ebbelwoi .

less known , but equally impressive , is the city 's flourishing arts scene . frankfurt am main may be the city 's official name but it 's often referred to as bankfurt or mainhattan .
that 's hardly surprising : the city has more than 40 gleaming skyscrapers , the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world -lrb- the börse -rrb- and 400 banking institutions , including the european central bank - home of the euro and all things monetary .
frankfurt also has the second largest airport in europe and hosts some of the largest trade fairs in the world , including the frankfurt book fair .
it 's no wonder that most people who come here are on business . what , unfortunately , goes unnoticed by the passers-through is the city 's incredible art scene .
spurred by critics who said this financial capital lacked a cultural soul , wealthy locals poured money into the arts , funding a mini museum-building boom in the early 90 's .
this medium-sized city of 650,000 spends more money per year on the arts - up to 10 percent of the city budget - than paris , london or any other major city in europe .
and even if the airport is all you see , there 's an art gallery there as well . along with the power-house museums , an independent gallery scene has cropped up , giving the city a respectable alternative edge and acting as a counterweight to the suits and ties and creating a bohemian oasis in a capitalist desert . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank headquarters the ' main ' part of frankfurt 's name comes from the river that bisects the city running east to west .
the north half could be chicago 's sister city with its sky-high glass towers marking the metropolitan banking and business sector .
among the towers leading the skyline is the commerzbank building -lrb- photo -rrb- .
completed in 1997 , it was designed by sir norman foster , who also gave the reichstag parliament building a facelift in berlin . the bustling banking center does n't go to sleep at the end of business hours , but buzzes well into the night - until the stock exchange bell rings in new york five hours later . things are a little more relaxed outside of the concrete jungle , down towards the river in römerberg , the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- district .
in extreme contrast to the banking area , römerberg has some of the only remaining medieval and historically significant buildings in the city that survived allied bombing during world war ii .
german democracy was born in paulskirche , where the first constitution was written in the middle of the 19th century .
the kaiserdom , an imperial cathedral , is where ten german emperors and kings were crowned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann wolfgang von goethe , the father of modern german literature , was born in frankfurt almost 250 years ago , and his timber-framed house -lrb- open to tourists -rrb- - where he penned the sorrows of young werther and faust - is also just minutes away from the altstadt . museum embankment just a short walk across the historical eiserner steg bridge to the other side of the main river brings one to the cultural promenade dubbed the museum embankment -lrb- museumsufer -rrb- .
ten years ago ' frankfurt ' was n't mentioned in the same breath as " fine art , " but things have since changed dramatically .
after a thorough remodelling and expansion under the guidance of architect johannes krahn , the 125-year-old städelsches kunstinstitut -lrb- städel art institute -rrb- reopened in 1999 as the city 's flagship for classical painting and sculpture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helene arendt the städel houses an impressive collection of works by van eyck , rubens , vermeer and others . the museum for modern art is another noteworthy new addition to the city .
completed in 1991 , the triangular modern structure was designed by austrian-born architect hans hollein and displays a modern collection , including roy lichtenstein , claes oldenburg and joseph beuys . the endless list of cultural highlights - frankfurt has over 40 museums in all - includes a communications museum , museum of applied arts , jewish museum and the german museum of film .
but frankfurt 's flourishing cultural scene extends beyond its powerhouse museums . the money flowing through the city nourished a cultural renaissance during the late ' 80s , bringing with it a new ballet company under the direction of american choreographer william forsythe , the künstlerhaus mousonturm , which exhibits interdisciplinary art , as well as the portikus gallery and the mak frankfurt center for art and design .
in a nod to the city 's cultural advances , the organizers of the manifesta art show chose the city to host their fourth event in 2001 .
a number of world-class galleries also came into prominence in the city 's altstadt in the area surrounding the schirn kunsthalle and the römerberg . sachsenhausen , west of the museumsufer , along the schaumainkai , is a great place to grab some food and drink after a long day of contemplating art .
here you have a choice : turn eastwards towards schweizer strasse lined with its bistros , posh cafés and trendy shops ; or head west towards alt-sachsenhausen where things get a bit more burly .
this is a great area to try frankfurt 's finest - ebbelwoi -lrb- apple wine -rrb- or " handkäse mit musik , " a local specialty of picked cheese and onions . nightlife a good place to start off the evening is at any of the apple wine taverns throughout the city .
with close to 48,000 students in frankfurt -lrb- not to mention the artists -rrb- , the city really comes alive at the dance and music clubs , especially after a couple of glasses of ebbelwoi .
some of the best places are located along the streets surrounding the northern part of the city center at the fressgasse and zeil . to the south , the römerberg and sachsenhausen offer abundant dining and nightlife opportunities .
berger strasse in frankfurt 's bornheim district is home to a thriving bar , restaurant and café scene , where you are as likely to bump into young flight attendants from lufthansa as you are up-and-coming bankers in their casual weekend wear . events frankfurt kicks off the year with the pre-lent fastnacht parades , then moves into the international music trade fair in march , followed by the international jazz festival and the fitting " skyscraper festival " in may .
august is a great time to visit frankfurt when the mainfest and the museumsuferfest fill the riverside area with art and apple wine .
the world 's largest book fair , founded in 1480 , takes place in october . five frankfurt must-sees : banking district most of frankfurt 's major financial houses are closed to the public , but it 's worth taking a quick walking tour through the city to see some of europe 's most spectacular skyscrapers .
the most noteworthy are the commerzbank building , at kaiserplatz , deutsche bank 's impressive glass twin towers at taunusanlage 12 and the european central bank , which rises above the city from its perch at kaiserstrasse 29 . the börse the deutsche börse , neue börsenstrasse 1 , is home to germany 's stock exchange and the international dax index .

the so-called " caliph of cologne , " in jail for inciting the murder of a rival , wo n't be deported to turkey , where he is wanted for planning attacks . following four years in a german prison , one of the country 's most controversial islamic figures has been released after narrowly escaping a deportation order to turkey . metin kaplan , the leader of the now-banned islamic association " caliphate state , " left the düsseldorf prison where he served four years for calling for the murder of a rival religious leader , according to a prison spokeswoman . his freedom came after a court rejected the turkish government 's bid to have kaplan extradited to his home country , where he is wanted for planning an attack on government officials . an opposition parliamentarian called kaplan 's release a " failure " on the part of the german government and interior minister otto schily . in talks with his turkish counterparts in march in ankara , schily said he was willing to ship out kaplan but wanted a guarantee that he would n't be tortured . a turkish court accuses kaplan of organizing a failed plot to crash a fuel-laden plane into the mausoleum of turkish state founder atatürk where government officials were gathering for a celebration in 1998 . no guarantee he would n't be tortured a spokesperson for the german higher regional court in düsseldorf said there were " serious concerns " kaplan would face torture by investigating authorities , despite the human rights legislation passed by the turkish parliament last fall . the decision ensures kaplan will remain germany 's problem for at least the time being . kaplan 's organization , an association of various islamic groups , had long been suspected of spreading anti-semitic , anti-american propaganda within germany 's islamic community . free but without a flock in 1996 , when another " caliph " established himself in berlin , kaplan told his organization 's members that his " head needed to be cut off .

in extreme contrast to the banking area , römerberg has some of the only remaining medieval and historically significant buildings in the city that survived allied bombing during world war ii .
german democracy was born in paulskirche , where the first constitution was written in the middle of the 19th century .
the kaiserdom , an imperial cathedral , is where ten german emperors and kings were crowned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann wolfgang von goethe , the father of modern german literature , was born in frankfurt almost 250 years ago , and his timber-framed house -lrb- open to tourists -rrb- - where he penned the sorrows of young werther and faust - is also just minutes away from the altstadt . museum embankment just a short walk across the historical eiserner steg bridge to the other side of the main river brings one to the cultural promenade dubbed the museum embankment -lrb- museumsufer -rrb- .
ten years ago ' frankfurt ' was n't mentioned in the same breath as " fine art , " but things have since changed dramatically .
after a thorough remodelling and expansion under the guidance of architect johannes krahn , the 125-year-old städelsches kunstinstitut -lrb- städel art institute -rrb- reopened in 1999 as the city 's flagship for classical painting and sculpture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helene arendt the städel houses an impressive collection of works by van eyck , rubens , vermeer and others . the museum for modern art is another noteworthy new addition to the city .
completed in 1991 , the triangular modern structure was designed by austrian-born architect hans hollein and displays a modern collection , including roy lichtenstein , claes oldenburg and joseph beuys . the endless list of cultural highlights - frankfurt has over 40 museums in all - includes a communications museum , museum of applied arts , jewish museum and the german museum of film .
but frankfurt 's flourishing cultural scene extends beyond its powerhouse museums . the money flowing through the city nourished a cultural renaissance during the late ' 80s , bringing with it a new ballet company under the direction of american choreographer william forsythe , the künstlerhaus mousonturm , which exhibits interdisciplinary art , as well as the portikus gallery and the mak frankfurt center for art and design .
in a nod to the city 's cultural advances , the organizers of the manifesta art show chose the city to host their fourth event in 2001 .
a number of world-class galleries also came into prominence in the city 's altstadt in the area surrounding the schirn kunsthalle and the römerberg . sachsenhausen , west of the museumsufer , along the schaumainkai , is a great place to grab some food and drink after a long day of contemplating art .
here you have a choice : turn eastwards towards schweizer strasse lined with its bistros , posh cafés and trendy shops ; or head west towards alt-sachsenhausen where things get a bit more burly .
this is a great area to try frankfurt 's finest - ebbelwoi -lrb- apple wine -rrb- or " handkäse mit musik , " a local specialty of picked cheese and onions . nightlife a good place to start off the evening is at any of the apple wine taverns throughout the city .
with close to 48,000 students in frankfurt -lrb- not to mention the artists -rrb- , the city really comes alive at the dance and music clubs , especially after a couple of glasses of ebbelwoi .
some of the best places are located along the streets surrounding the northern part of the city center at the fressgasse and zeil . to the south , the römerberg and sachsenhausen offer abundant dining and nightlife opportunities .
berger strasse in frankfurt 's bornheim district is home to a thriving bar , restaurant and café scene , where you are as likely to bump into young flight attendants from lufthansa as you are up-and-coming bankers in their casual weekend wear . events frankfurt kicks off the year with the pre-lent fastnacht parades , then moves into the international music trade fair in march , followed by the international jazz festival and the fitting " skyscraper festival " in may .
august is a great time to visit frankfurt when the mainfest and the museumsuferfest fill the riverside area with art and apple wine .
the world 's largest book fair , founded in 1480 , takes place in october . five frankfurt must-sees : banking district most of frankfurt 's major financial houses are closed to the public , but it 's worth taking a quick walking tour through the city to see some of europe 's most spectacular skyscrapers .
the most noteworthy are the commerzbank building , at kaiserplatz , deutsche bank 's impressive glass twin towers at taunusanlage 12 and the european central bank , which rises above the city from its perch at kaiserstrasse 29 . the börse the deutsche börse , neue börsenstrasse 1 , is home to germany 's stock exchange and the international dax index .

less known , but equally impressive , is the city 's flourishing arts scene . frankfurt am main may be the city 's official name but it 's often referred to as bankfurt or mainhattan .
that 's hardly surprising : the city has more than 40 gleaming skyscrapers , the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world -lrb- the börse -rrb- and 400 banking institutions , including the european central bank - home of the euro and all things monetary .
frankfurt also has the second largest airport in europe and hosts some of the largest trade fairs in the world , including the frankfurt book fair .
it 's no wonder that most people who come here are on business . what , unfortunately , goes unnoticed by the passers-through is the city 's incredible art scene .
spurred by critics who said this financial capital lacked a cultural soul , wealthy locals poured money into the arts , funding a mini museum-building boom in the early 90 's .
this medium-sized city of 650,000 spends more money per year on the arts - up to 10 percent of the city budget - than paris , london or any other major city in europe .
and even if the airport is all you see , there 's an art gallery there as well . along with the power-house museums , an independent gallery scene has cropped up , giving the city a respectable alternative edge and acting as a counterweight to the suits and ties and creating a bohemian oasis in a capitalist desert . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank headquarters the ' main ' part of frankfurt 's name comes from the river that bisects the city running east to west .
the north half could be chicago 's sister city with its sky-high glass towers marking the metropolitan banking and business sector .
among the towers leading the skyline is the commerzbank building -lrb- photo -rrb- .
completed in 1997 , it was designed by sir norman foster , who also gave the reichstag parliament building a facelift in berlin . the bustling banking center does n't go to sleep at the end of business hours , but buzzes well into the night - until the stock exchange bell rings in new york five hours later . things are a little more relaxed outside of the concrete jungle , down towards the river in römerberg , the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- district .
in extreme contrast to the banking area , römerberg has some of the only remaining medieval and historically significant buildings in the city that survived allied bombing during world war ii .
german democracy was born in paulskirche , where the first constitution was written in the middle of the 19th century .
the kaiserdom , an imperial cathedral , is where ten german emperors and kings were crowned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann wolfgang von goethe , the father of modern german literature , was born in frankfurt almost 250 years ago , and his timber-framed house -lrb- open to tourists -rrb- - where he penned the sorrows of young werther and faust - is also just minutes away from the altstadt . museum embankment just a short walk across the historical eiserner steg bridge to the other side of the main river brings one to the cultural promenade dubbed the museum embankment -lrb- museumsufer -rrb- .
ten years ago ' frankfurt ' was n't mentioned in the same breath as " fine art , " but things have since changed dramatically .
after a thorough remodelling and expansion under the guidance of architect johannes krahn , the 125-year-old städelsches kunstinstitut -lrb- städel art institute -rrb- reopened in 1999 as the city 's flagship for classical painting and sculpture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helene arendt the städel houses an impressive collection of works by van eyck , rubens , vermeer and others . the museum for modern art is another noteworthy new addition to the city .
completed in 1991 , the triangular modern structure was designed by austrian-born architect hans hollein and displays a modern collection , including roy lichtenstein , claes oldenburg and joseph beuys . the endless list of cultural highlights - frankfurt has over 40 museums in all - includes a communications museum , museum of applied arts , jewish museum and the german museum of film .
but frankfurt 's flourishing cultural scene extends beyond its powerhouse museums . the money flowing through the city nourished a cultural renaissance during the late ' 80s , bringing with it a new ballet company under the direction of american choreographer william forsythe , the künstlerhaus mousonturm , which exhibits interdisciplinary art , as well as the portikus gallery and the mak frankfurt center for art and design .
in a nod to the city 's cultural advances , the organizers of the manifesta art show chose the city to host their fourth event in 2001 .
a number of world-class galleries also came into prominence in the city 's altstadt in the area surrounding the schirn kunsthalle and the römerberg . sachsenhausen , west of the museumsufer , along the schaumainkai , is a great place to grab some food and drink after a long day of contemplating art .
here you have a choice : turn eastwards towards schweizer strasse lined with its bistros , posh cafés and trendy shops ; or head west towards alt-sachsenhausen where things get a bit more burly .
this is a great area to try frankfurt 's finest - ebbelwoi -lrb- apple wine -rrb- or " handkäse mit musik , " a local specialty of picked cheese and onions . nightlife a good place to start off the evening is at any of the apple wine taverns throughout the city .
with close to 48,000 students in frankfurt -lrb- not to mention the artists -rrb- , the city really comes alive at the dance and music clubs , especially after a couple of glasses of ebbelwoi .
some of the best places are located along the streets surrounding the northern part of the city center at the fressgasse and zeil . to the south , the römerberg and sachsenhausen offer abundant dining and nightlife opportunities .
berger strasse in frankfurt 's bornheim district is home to a thriving bar , restaurant and café scene , where you are as likely to bump into young flight attendants from lufthansa as you are up-and-coming bankers in their casual weekend wear . events frankfurt kicks off the year with the pre-lent fastnacht parades , then moves into the international music trade fair in march , followed by the international jazz festival and the fitting " skyscraper festival " in may .
august is a great time to visit frankfurt when the mainfest and the museumsuferfest fill the riverside area with art and apple wine .
the world 's largest book fair , founded in 1480 , takes place in october . five frankfurt must-sees : banking district most of frankfurt 's major financial houses are closed to the public , but it 's worth taking a quick walking tour through the city to see some of europe 's most spectacular skyscrapers .
the most noteworthy are the commerzbank building , at kaiserplatz , deutsche bank 's impressive glass twin towers at taunusanlage 12 and the european central bank , which rises above the city from its perch at kaiserstrasse 29 . the börse the deutsche börse , neue börsenstrasse 1 , is home to germany 's stock exchange and the international dax index .

less known , but equally impressive , is the city 's flourishing arts scene . frankfurt am main may be the city 's official name but it 's often referred to as bankfurt or mainhattan .
that 's hardly surprising : the city has more than 40 gleaming skyscrapers , the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world -lrb- the börse -rrb- and 400 banking institutions , including the european central bank - home of the euro and all things monetary .
frankfurt also has the second largest airport in europe and hosts some of the largest trade fairs in the world , including the frankfurt book fair .
it 's no wonder that most people who come here are on business . what , unfortunately , goes unnoticed by the passers-through is the city 's incredible art scene .
spurred by critics who said this financial capital lacked a cultural soul , wealthy locals poured money into the arts , funding a mini museum-building boom in the early 90 's .
this medium-sized city of 650,000 spends more money per year on the arts - up to 10 percent of the city budget - than paris , london or any other major city in europe .
and even if the airport is all you see , there 's an art gallery there as well . along with the power-house museums , an independent gallery scene has cropped up , giving the city a respectable alternative edge and acting as a counterweight to the suits and ties and creating a bohemian oasis in a capitalist desert . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank headquarters the ' main ' part of frankfurt 's name comes from the river that bisects the city running east to west .
the north half could be chicago 's sister city with its sky-high glass towers marking the metropolitan banking and business sector .
among the towers leading the skyline is the commerzbank building -lrb- photo -rrb- .
completed in 1997 , it was designed by sir norman foster , who also gave the reichstag parliament building a facelift in berlin . the bustling banking center does n't go to sleep at the end of business hours , but buzzes well into the night - until the stock exchange bell rings in new york five hours later . things are a little more relaxed outside of the concrete jungle , down towards the river in römerberg , the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- district .
in extreme contrast to the banking area , römerberg has some of the only remaining medieval and historically significant buildings in the city that survived allied bombing during world war ii .
german democracy was born in paulskirche , where the first constitution was written in the middle of the 19th century .
the kaiserdom , an imperial cathedral , is where ten german emperors and kings were crowned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann wolfgang von goethe , the father of modern german literature , was born in frankfurt almost 250 years ago , and his timber-framed house -lrb- open to tourists -rrb- - where he penned the sorrows of young werther and faust - is also just minutes away from the altstadt . museum embankment just a short walk across the historical eiserner steg bridge to the other side of the main river brings one to the cultural promenade dubbed the museum embankment -lrb- museumsufer -rrb- .
ten years ago ' frankfurt ' was n't mentioned in the same breath as " fine art , " but things have since changed dramatically .

but frankfurt 's flourishing cultural scene extends beyond its powerhouse museums . the money flowing through the city nourished a cultural renaissance during the late ' 80s , bringing with it a new ballet company under the direction of american choreographer william forsythe , the künstlerhaus mousonturm , which exhibits interdisciplinary art , as well as the portikus gallery and the mak frankfurt center for art and design .
in a nod to the city 's cultural advances , the organizers of the manifesta art show chose the city to host their fourth event in 2001 .
a number of world-class galleries also came into prominence in the city 's altstadt in the area surrounding the schirn kunsthalle and the römerberg . sachsenhausen , west of the museumsufer , along the schaumainkai , is a great place to grab some food and drink after a long day of contemplating art .
here you have a choice : turn eastwards towards schweizer strasse lined with its bistros , posh cafés and trendy shops ; or head west towards alt-sachsenhausen where things get a bit more burly .
this is a great area to try frankfurt 's finest - ebbelwoi -lrb- apple wine -rrb- or " handkäse mit musik , " a local specialty of picked cheese and onions . nightlife a good place to start off the evening is at any of the apple wine taverns throughout the city .

less known , but equally impressive , is the city 's flourishing arts scene . frankfurt am main may be the city 's official name but it 's often referred to as bankfurt or mainhattan .
that 's hardly surprising : the city has more than 40 gleaming skyscrapers , the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world -lrb- the börse -rrb- and 400 banking institutions , including the european central bank - home of the euro and all things monetary .
frankfurt also has the second largest airport in europe and hosts some of the largest trade fairs in the world , including the frankfurt book fair .
it 's no wonder that most people who come here are on business . what , unfortunately , goes unnoticed by the passers-through is the city 's incredible art scene .
spurred by critics who said this financial capital lacked a cultural soul , wealthy locals poured money into the arts , funding a mini museum-building boom in the early 90 's .
this medium-sized city of 650,000 spends more money per year on the arts - up to 10 percent of the city budget - than paris , london or any other major city in europe .
and even if the airport is all you see , there 's an art gallery there as well . along with the power-house museums , an independent gallery scene has cropped up , giving the city a respectable alternative edge and acting as a counterweight to the suits and ties and creating a bohemian oasis in a capitalist desert . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank headquarters the ' main ' part of frankfurt 's name comes from the river that bisects the city running east to west .
the north half could be chicago 's sister city with its sky-high glass towers marking the metropolitan banking and business sector .
among the towers leading the skyline is the commerzbank building -lrb- photo -rrb- .
completed in 1997 , it was designed by sir norman foster , who also gave the reichstag parliament building a facelift in berlin . the bustling banking center does n't go to sleep at the end of business hours , but buzzes well into the night - until the stock exchange bell rings in new york five hours later . things are a little more relaxed outside of the concrete jungle , down towards the river in römerberg , the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- district .
in extreme contrast to the banking area , römerberg has some of the only remaining medieval and historically significant buildings in the city that survived allied bombing during world war ii .
german democracy was born in paulskirche , where the first constitution was written in the middle of the 19th century .
the kaiserdom , an imperial cathedral , is where ten german emperors and kings were crowned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann wolfgang von goethe , the father of modern german literature , was born in frankfurt almost 250 years ago , and his timber-framed house -lrb- open to tourists -rrb- - where he penned the sorrows of young werther and faust - is also just minutes away from the altstadt . museum embankment just a short walk across the historical eiserner steg bridge to the other side of the main river brings one to the cultural promenade dubbed the museum embankment -lrb- museumsufer -rrb- .

but frankfurt 's flourishing cultural scene extends beyond its powerhouse museums . the money flowing through the city nourished a cultural renaissance during the late ' 80s , bringing with it a new ballet company under the direction of american choreographer william forsythe , the künstlerhaus mousonturm , which exhibits interdisciplinary art , as well as the portikus gallery and the mak frankfurt center for art and design .
in a nod to the city 's cultural advances , the organizers of the manifesta art show chose the city to host their fourth event in 2001 .
a number of world-class galleries also came into prominence in the city 's altstadt in the area surrounding the schirn kunsthalle and the römerberg . sachsenhausen , west of the museumsufer , along the schaumainkai , is a great place to grab some food and drink after a long day of contemplating art .
here you have a choice : turn eastwards towards schweizer strasse lined with its bistros , posh cafés and trendy shops ; or head west towards alt-sachsenhausen where things get a bit more burly .
this is a great area to try frankfurt 's finest - ebbelwoi -lrb- apple wine -rrb- or " handkäse mit musik , " a local specialty of picked cheese and onions . nightlife a good place to start off the evening is at any of the apple wine taverns throughout the city .
with close to 48,000 students in frankfurt -lrb- not to mention the artists -rrb- , the city really comes alive at the dance and music clubs , especially after a couple of glasses of ebbelwoi .
some of the best places are located along the streets surrounding the northern part of the city center at the fressgasse and zeil . to the south , the römerberg and sachsenhausen offer abundant dining and nightlife opportunities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german cities and towns : an irreverent insiders ' guide hamburg : germany 's gate to the world berlin : it 's the wurst ! exploring berlin under your feet hanover : grottos , gardens and guerillas visit germany -pipe- 27.05.2003 i 'll take mainhattan : a guide to frankfurt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt 's skyline glitters at night as germany 's financial center , frankfurt , or bankfurt , is home to some of the world 's biggest banking institutions .
less known , but equally impressive , is the city 's flourishing arts scene . frankfurt am main may be the city 's official name but it 's often referred to as bankfurt or mainhattan .
that 's hardly surprising : the city has more than 40 gleaming skyscrapers , the fourth-largest stock exchange in the world -lrb- the börse -rrb- and 400 banking institutions , including the european central bank - home of the euro and all things monetary .
frankfurt also has the second largest airport in europe and hosts some of the largest trade fairs in the world , including the frankfurt book fair .
it 's no wonder that most people who come here are on business . what , unfortunately , goes unnoticed by the passers-through is the city 's incredible art scene .
spurred by critics who said this financial capital lacked a cultural soul , wealthy locals poured money into the arts , funding a mini museum-building boom in the early 90 's .
this medium-sized city of 650,000 spends more money per year on the arts - up to 10 percent of the city budget - than paris , london or any other major city in europe .
and even if the airport is all you see , there 's an art gallery there as well . along with the power-house museums , an independent gallery scene has cropped up , giving the city a respectable alternative edge and acting as a counterweight to the suits and ties and creating a bohemian oasis in a capitalist desert . the lay of the land bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank headquarters the ' main ' part of frankfurt 's name comes from the river that bisects the city running east to west .
the north half could be chicago 's sister city with its sky-high glass towers marking the metropolitan banking and business sector .
among the towers leading the skyline is the commerzbank building -lrb- photo -rrb- .
completed in 1997 , it was designed by sir norman foster , who also gave the reichstag parliament building a facelift in berlin . the bustling banking center does n't go to sleep at the end of business hours , but buzzes well into the night - until the stock exchange bell rings in new york five hours later . things are a little more relaxed outside of the concrete jungle , down towards the river in römerberg , the altstadt -lrb- old city -rrb- district .
in extreme contrast to the banking area , römerberg has some of the only remaining medieval and historically significant buildings in the city that survived allied bombing during world war ii .
german democracy was born in paulskirche , where the first constitution was written in the middle of the 19th century .
the kaiserdom , an imperial cathedral , is where ten german emperors and kings were crowned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann wolfgang von goethe , the father of modern german literature , was born in frankfurt almost 250 years ago , and his timber-framed house -lrb- open to tourists -rrb- - where he penned the sorrows of young werther and faust - is also just minutes away from the altstadt . museum embankment just a short walk across the historical eiserner steg bridge to the other side of the main river brings one to the cultural promenade dubbed the museum embankment -lrb- museumsufer -rrb- .
ten years ago ' frankfurt ' was n't mentioned in the same breath as " fine art , " but things have since changed dramatically .
after a thorough remodelling and expansion under the guidance of architect johannes krahn , the 125-year-old städelsches kunstinstitut -lrb- städel art institute -rrb- reopened in 1999 as the city 's flagship for classical painting and sculpture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helene arendt the städel houses an impressive collection of works by van eyck , rubens , vermeer and others . the museum for modern art is another noteworthy new addition to the city .
completed in 1991 , the triangular modern structure was designed by austrian-born architect hans hollein and displays a modern collection , including roy lichtenstein , claes oldenburg and joseph beuys . the endless list of cultural highlights - frankfurt has over 40 museums in all - includes a communications museum , museum of applied arts , jewish museum and the german museum of film .
but frankfurt 's flourishing cultural scene extends beyond its powerhouse museums . the money flowing through the city nourished a cultural renaissance during the late ' 80s , bringing with it a new ballet company under the direction of american choreographer william forsythe , the künstlerhaus mousonturm , which exhibits interdisciplinary art , as well as the portikus gallery and the mak frankfurt center for art and design .
in a nod to the city 's cultural advances , the organizers of the manifesta art show chose the city to host their fourth event in 2001 .
a number of world-class galleries also came into prominence in the city 's altstadt in the area surrounding the schirn kunsthalle and the römerberg . sachsenhausen , west of the museumsufer , along the schaumainkai , is a great place to grab some food and drink after a long day of contemplating art .
here you have a choice : turn eastwards towards schweizer strasse lined with its bistros , posh cafés and trendy shops ; or head west towards alt-sachsenhausen where things get a bit more burly .
this is a great area to try frankfurt 's finest - ebbelwoi -lrb- apple wine -rrb- or " handkäse mit musik , " a local specialty of picked cheese and onions . nightlife a good place to start off the evening is at any of the apple wine taverns throughout the city .
with close to 48,000 students in frankfurt -lrb- not to mention the artists -rrb- , the city really comes alive at the dance and music clubs , especially after a couple of glasses of ebbelwoi .
some of the best places are located along the streets surrounding the northern part of the city center at the fressgasse and zeil . to the south , the römerberg and sachsenhausen offer abundant dining and nightlife opportunities .
berger strasse in frankfurt 's bornheim district is home to a thriving bar , restaurant and café scene , where you are as likely to bump into young flight attendants from lufthansa as you are up-and-coming bankers in their casual weekend wear . events frankfurt kicks off the year with the pre-lent fastnacht parades , then moves into the international music trade fair in march , followed by the international jazz festival and the fitting " skyscraper festival " in may .
august is a great time to visit frankfurt when the mainfest and the museumsuferfest fill the riverside area with art and apple wine .
the world 's largest book fair , founded in 1480 , takes place in october . five frankfurt must-sees : banking district most of frankfurt 's major financial houses are closed to the public , but it 's worth taking a quick walking tour through the city to see some of europe 's most spectacular skyscrapers .
the most noteworthy are the commerzbank building , at kaiserplatz , deutsche bank 's impressive glass twin towers at taunusanlage 12 and the european central bank , which rises above the city from its perch at kaiserstrasse 29 . the börse the deutsche börse , neue börsenstrasse 1 , is home to germany 's stock exchange and the international dax index .

france sent a reconnaissance team to the former belgian colony over the weekend to scout out the nuts and bolts of a possible troop deployment .
the team met with un officials on sunday in the capital of kinshasa , in the far west of the country , to give their report .
british prime minister tony blair said his government is considering a request by u.n. secretary general kofi annan last week to contribute to a multinational security force .
germany , which has so far pledged no troops , is sending deputy assistant foreign minister kerstin müller on a tour of the region this week to assess the situation . stops include kenya , rwanda , uganda and congo , where she will meet with government officials , aid organizations and u.n. officials to assess the situation .
a spokesperson for the foreign ministry told dw-world germany was taking part in u.n. and european union discussions on a possible multinational force , but would n't say whether the country would take part . " we support the efforts of the u.n. to expand the mandate of the current peacekeepers , " the spokesperson said . kids with guns , town a virtual battleground international military aid could n't come at a more crucial time .
fighting between rival lendu and hema militias over the mineral-rich area killed hundreds and injured and displaced tens of thousands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hema militia soldiers including a woman play with grenades near the un compound in bunia , saturday may 17 , 2003 in the congo .
fighting in and around bunia between armed militias linked to rival hema and lendu tribes was estimated by the united nations to have killed hundreds of people in the past week .
-lrb- ap photo / karel prinsloo -rrb- the town of bunia has been particularly hard hit .
the united nations discovered more than 300 bodies following fighting between the militia , including those of two u.n. observers .
horror photos of children toting ak 47s and dismembered bodies have circulated in the international media . more than 80 percent of the town 's estimated 150,000 residents have fled the town during the two weeks of fighting . the u.n. human rights commissioner fears the fighting could spark a " second rwanda , " yet another inter-ethnic genocide in the region .
already , more than 2.5 million have died during fighting in the unstable republic in recent years , according to the united nations . congo brings instability to the region conflicts between congolese rebels and government troops in the late 1990s , involved soldiers from surrounding uganda , rwanda , angola , namibia , zimbabwe , chad and sudan . though peace pacts and cease fires were signed , it was not until the son of assassinated former rebel leader turned president laurent kabila took power in 2001 that hopes for a long-lasting peace in the central africa region began to materialize . small-time skirmishes continued , but none with the scope of the current conflict . the two warring factions began fighting when ugandan troops withdrew as part of a peace deal earlier this month . " there were always battles over land in the past , that also involved violence , " said stefan mair , the africa specialist at the german institute for security and international affairs .
" but it never had the dimensions of the past years .

france sent a reconnaissance team to the former belgian colony over the weekend to scout out the nuts and bolts of a possible troop deployment .
the team met with un officials on sunday in the capital of kinshasa , in the far west of the country , to give their report .
british prime minister tony blair said his government is considering a request by u.n. secretary general kofi annan last week to contribute to a multinational security force .
germany , which has so far pledged no troops , is sending deputy assistant foreign minister kerstin müller on a tour of the region this week to assess the situation . stops include kenya , rwanda , uganda and congo , where she will meet with government officials , aid organizations and u.n. officials to assess the situation .
a spokesperson for the foreign ministry told dw-world germany was taking part in u.n. and european union discussions on a possible multinational force , but would n't say whether the country would take part . " we support the efforts of the u.n. to expand the mandate of the current peacekeepers , " the spokesperson said . kids with guns , town a virtual battleground international military aid could n't come at a more crucial time .

fighting in and around bunia between armed militias linked to rival hema and lendu tribes was estimated by the united nations to have killed hundreds of people in the past week .
-lrb- ap photo / karel prinsloo -rrb- the town of bunia has been particularly hard hit .
the united nations discovered more than 300 bodies following fighting between the militia , including those of two u.n. observers .
horror photos of children toting ak 47s and dismembered bodies have circulated in the international media . more than 80 percent of the town 's estimated 150,000 residents have fled the town during the two weeks of fighting . the u.n. human rights commissioner fears the fighting could spark a " second rwanda , " yet another inter-ethnic genocide in the region .
already , more than 2.5 million have died during fighting in the unstable republic in recent years , according to the united nations . congo brings instability to the region conflicts between congolese rebels and government troops in the late 1990s , involved soldiers from surrounding uganda , rwanda , angola , namibia , zimbabwe , chad and sudan . though peace pacts and cease fires were signed , it was not until the son of assassinated former rebel leader turned president laurent kabila took power in 2001 that hopes for a long-lasting peace in the central africa region began to materialize . small-time skirmishes continued , but none with the scope of the current conflict . the two warring factions began fighting when ugandan troops withdrew as part of a peace deal earlier this month . " there were always battles over land in the past , that also involved violence , " said stefan mair , the africa specialist at the german institute for security and international affairs .

in extreme contrast to the banking area , römerberg has some of the only remaining medieval and historically significant buildings in the city that survived allied bombing during world war ii .
german democracy was born in paulskirche , where the first constitution was written in the middle of the 19th century .
the kaiserdom , an imperial cathedral , is where ten german emperors and kings were crowned . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : johann wolfgang von goethe , the father of modern german literature , was born in frankfurt almost 250 years ago , and his timber-framed house -lrb- open to tourists -rrb- - where he penned the sorrows of young werther and faust - is also just minutes away from the altstadt . museum embankment just a short walk across the historical eiserner steg bridge to the other side of the main river brings one to the cultural promenade dubbed the museum embankment -lrb- museumsufer -rrb- .
ten years ago ' frankfurt ' was n't mentioned in the same breath as " fine art , " but things have since changed dramatically .
after a thorough remodelling and expansion under the guidance of architect johannes krahn , the 125-year-old städelsches kunstinstitut -lrb- städel art institute -rrb- reopened in 1999 as the city 's flagship for classical painting and sculpture .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helene arendt the städel houses an impressive collection of works by van eyck , rubens , vermeer and others . the museum for modern art is another noteworthy new addition to the city .
completed in 1991 , the triangular modern structure was designed by austrian-born architect hans hollein and displays a modern collection , including roy lichtenstein , claes oldenburg and joseph beuys . the endless list of cultural highlights - frankfurt has over 40 museums in all - includes a communications museum , museum of applied arts , jewish museum and the german museum of film .
but frankfurt 's flourishing cultural scene extends beyond its powerhouse museums . the money flowing through the city nourished a cultural renaissance during the late ' 80s , bringing with it a new ballet company under the direction of american choreographer william forsythe , the künstlerhaus mousonturm , which exhibits interdisciplinary art , as well as the portikus gallery and the mak frankfurt center for art and design .
in a nod to the city 's cultural advances , the organizers of the manifesta art show chose the city to host their fourth event in 2001 .
a number of world-class galleries also came into prominence in the city 's altstadt in the area surrounding the schirn kunsthalle and the römerberg . sachsenhausen , west of the museumsufer , along the schaumainkai , is a great place to grab some food and drink after a long day of contemplating art .
here you have a choice : turn eastwards towards schweizer strasse lined with its bistros , posh cafés and trendy shops ; or head west towards alt-sachsenhausen where things get a bit more burly .
this is a great area to try frankfurt 's finest - ebbelwoi -lrb- apple wine -rrb- or " handkäse mit musik , " a local specialty of picked cheese and onions . nightlife a good place to start off the evening is at any of the apple wine taverns throughout the city .
with close to 48,000 students in frankfurt -lrb- not to mention the artists -rrb- , the city really comes alive at the dance and music clubs , especially after a couple of glasses of ebbelwoi .
some of the best places are located along the streets surrounding the northern part of the city center at the fressgasse and zeil . to the south , the römerberg and sachsenhausen offer abundant dining and nightlife opportunities .
berger strasse in frankfurt 's bornheim district is home to a thriving bar , restaurant and café scene , where you are as likely to bump into young flight attendants from lufthansa as you are up-and-coming bankers in their casual weekend wear . events frankfurt kicks off the year with the pre-lent fastnacht parades , then moves into the international music trade fair in march , followed by the international jazz festival and the fitting " skyscraper festival " in may .
august is a great time to visit frankfurt when the mainfest and the museumsuferfest fill the riverside area with art and apple wine .
the world 's largest book fair , founded in 1480 , takes place in october . five frankfurt must-sees : banking district most of frankfurt 's major financial houses are closed to the public , but it 's worth taking a quick walking tour through the city to see some of europe 's most spectacular skyscrapers .

france sent a reconnaissance team to the former belgian colony over the weekend to scout out the nuts and bolts of a possible troop deployment .
the team met with un officials on sunday in the capital of kinshasa , in the far west of the country , to give their report .
british prime minister tony blair said his government is considering a request by u.n. secretary general kofi annan last week to contribute to a multinational security force .
germany , which has so far pledged no troops , is sending deputy assistant foreign minister kerstin müller on a tour of the region this week to assess the situation . stops include kenya , rwanda , uganda and congo , where she will meet with government officials , aid organizations and u.n. officials to assess the situation .
a spokesperson for the foreign ministry told dw-world germany was taking part in u.n. and european union discussions on a possible multinational force , but would n't say whether the country would take part . " we support the efforts of the u.n. to expand the mandate of the current peacekeepers , " the spokesperson said . kids with guns , town a virtual battleground international military aid could n't come at a more crucial time .
fighting between rival lendu and hema militias over the mineral-rich area killed hundreds and injured and displaced tens of thousands . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hema militia soldiers including a woman play with grenades near the un compound in bunia , saturday may 17 , 2003 in the congo .
fighting in and around bunia between armed militias linked to rival hema and lendu tribes was estimated by the united nations to have killed hundreds of people in the past week .
-lrb- ap photo / karel prinsloo -rrb- the town of bunia has been particularly hard hit .
the united nations discovered more than 300 bodies following fighting between the militia , including those of two u.n. observers .
horror photos of children toting ak 47s and dismembered bodies have circulated in the international media . more than 80 percent of the town 's estimated 150,000 residents have fled the town during the two weeks of fighting . the u.n. human rights commissioner fears the fighting could spark a " second rwanda , " yet another inter-ethnic genocide in the region .
already , more than 2.5 million have died during fighting in the unstable republic in recent years , according to the united nations . congo brings instability to the region conflicts between congolese rebels and government troops in the late 1990s , involved soldiers from surrounding uganda , rwanda , angola , namibia , zimbabwe , chad and sudan . though peace pacts and cease fires were signed , it was not until the son of assassinated former rebel leader turned president laurent kabila took power in 2001 that hopes for a long-lasting peace in the central africa region began to materialize . small-time skirmishes continued , but none with the scope of the current conflict . the two warring factions began fighting when ugandan troops withdrew as part of a peace deal earlier this month . " there were always battles over land in the past , that also involved violence , " said stefan mair , the africa specialist at the german institute for security and international affairs .
" but it never had the dimensions of the past years .

they also hope to provide more anonymous accommodation for victims because the location of the safe house is now widely known to traffickers .
" there is no intention to remove all protection and support to victims of child trafficking , " the spokeswoman said .
the council , which is carrying out consultation , is expected to reach a decision later this summer .

unicef , in partnership with other children 's organisations , is seeking to prevent plans by west sussex county council to close the facility .
the only one of its kind in the uk , the west sussex safe house was set up three years ago to prevent 16 and 17-year-old girls who claimed asylum at gatwick falling prey to traffickers .
but the council says the six-bed facility , which operates from two semi-detached houses in a suburban street , is no longer needed because fewer girls are now at risk .
sexual exploitation unicef has called on the department of health to fund the house , which it says is a model for how to care for and protect young women forced into prostitution .
a spokesman for unicef said : " this safe house needs to be kept open .
" looking across other countries in europe it is by far the most effective means to help victims of trafficking and commercial sexual exploitation . "
he said the government should guarantee the future of the safe house to back up its new sexual offences bill testify against traffickers " you need a government-funded service to protect and take care of victims because only then can they feel safe and testify against the traffickers , " he said .
but west sussex county council said the number of teenagers assessed to be at risk had dropped from 21 in 2000 to none in 2003 .
" undoubtedly the provision of a safe house has affected trafficking patterns in west sussex , " a spokeswoman said .
" however , it is less clear whether it is the disruption caused to the trafficking trade - and a subsequent move of that trade to other areas - or the service provided by the safe house that has been most effective . "
threaten retribution the safe house supports young women in resisting traffickers who threaten retribution against themselves or their families if they do not co-operate .
but social services managers argue they can use the money saved by closing the house to help all young people under 18 .
they also hope to provide more anonymous accommodation for victims because the location of the safe house is now widely known to traffickers .

speaking at the end of a week-long tour in thailand , hina jilani said the authorities had used the campaign to target minority groups in the country .
more than 2,000 people died in thailand 's anti-drugs campaign the government 's so-called war on drugs was a three month law enforcement campaign beginning in march , designed to rid the country of its image as a haven for drug dealers .
prime minister thaksin shinawatra declared it a major success - but not everyone agrees .
human rights groups have criticised what they call the violent conduct of the campaign - and say that more than 2,000 people have been killed by police since march .
kofi annan 's representative on human rights , hina jilani , is the latest to add her voice to that criticism .
" there are indications that this campaign against drugs is being used by security forces to target the more marginalised communities , " she said .
she added that those communities had been placed at risk as a result of the campaign .
mr thaksin has consistently denied this criticism .
he says the initiative has broad support across the nation - and there is no doubt that many ordinary thais are happy that he has taken a stand on one of the country 's most entrenched problems .
in fact , it has been such a political success that mr thaksin is expected to launch a new campaign at the end of the month - this time against criminal gangs .
