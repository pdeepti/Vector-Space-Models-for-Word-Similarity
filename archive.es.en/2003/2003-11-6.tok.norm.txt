the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.11.2003 german parliament freezes pensions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pensioners protest government reform plans .
german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .
pensioner advocates accused the government of breaching a promise to bring pensions in the former east germany up to west german standards .
the freeze would prevent this for years to come , the president of the national pensioners ' association told a local newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pension cuts draw fire schröder 's cuts could come back to haunt him as greying germans take to the polls in 2006 .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .
pensioner advocates accused the government of breaching a promise to bring pensions in the former east germany up to west german standards .

chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .

berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy . " " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy . " " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.11.2003 the european union strikes back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even u.s. honey will be taxed .
the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

" " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the prosecution of sascha o. , a prominent television business commentator and editor-in-chief of a business magazine , was the first of its kind in germany .
a stuttgart regional court previously ruled that the journalist had committed insider trading in october 2000 , when he purchased stocks on germany 's high-tech neuer markt index that later rose after he recommended the purchase of two funds that contained the stock .
the court said he then sold the stocks , turning a € 115,000 profit .
after his conviction , the court sentenced sascha o. to one year in prison .
however , the court in karlsruhe said since it could not be proven the journalist used information from a third party , the insider trading prosecution had to be overturned . more briefs 06.11.2003 -pipe- journalist 's insider trading conviction thrown out 05.11.2003 -pipe- german magazine market bouncing back 05.11.2003 -pipe- budget airline easyjet on expansion course in germany 05.11.2003 -pipe- german job market set to remain weak , survey finds 05.11.2003 -pipe- deutsche bank trading practices under investigation in u.s. 04.11.2003 -pipe- germans repay debt despite economic woes 03.11.2003 -pipe- metro plans investment in china 03.11.2003 -pipe- trade unions reject longer workweek radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.11.2003 the european union strikes back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even u.s. honey will be taxed .
the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

russian president vladimir putin met with eu leaders in rome on thursday .
european concerns over the recent arrest of oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky dominated the talks . european union leaders questioned putin on the recent incarceration of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former head of oil giant yukos , on charges of fraud and tax evasion . " it 's crucial to keep the entire -lrb- legal -rrb- proceedings transparent and in unison with the norms of a constitutional state , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told russian reporters . prior to the meeting , eu leaders had already said they would ask putin to " clarify " the matter . critics see the arrest as an attempt to silence khodorkovsky , a billionaire businessman , who has openly supported russia 's political opposition . putin denies allegations of rising authoritarianism the russian president denied the allegations that he was trying control the justice system 's handling of the khodorkovsky affair .
instead , he said the arrest should not be seen as a sign of rising authoritarianism . " everyone has to obey the law at all times , " he told italian journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky at the courthouse in moscow .
putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .
questioning the results of privatization in the 1990s was not an option , " even if they are far from ideal , " putin said . berlusconi defends putin italian premier silivo berlusconi , a close personal friend of putin 's , turned out to be his guest 's biggest supporter during the day . when journalists started asking putin about the yukos affair , berlusconi stepped in and explained that all suspicions against the russian were unfounded . italy , which currently holds the presidency and therefore hosted the summit , considers the khodorkovsky arrest an internal affair . " i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .
russia has been trying to join the organization for more than ten years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin , eu commission president prodi and eu foreign policy commissioner javier solana during a meeting last may .
before that happens , some issues have to be resolved , however . most recently , eu demands to raise russian energy prices to world market levels slowed down the process .
putin has rejected this , saying that higher prices would ruin russia 's economy . eu officials say that no one is asking russia to do more than other countries in a similar situation .
the eu considers lower prices an unfair advantage for russian companies who export their goods . talks on visa-free travel both sides agreed to work toward visa-free travel between eu member states and russia in the long term . eu leaders have rejected this idea so far , saying that russia 's border controls are too lax and russian passports not forgery-proof .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .
and his opinion could end up being key , especially since the project would end up being built in his front yard . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host biggest world cup ever germany 's world cup in 2006 will be the biggest ever after governing body fifa approved an enlargement plan increasing the number of teams from 32 to 36 .
however , the decision has caused divisions within the game .

russian president vladimir putin met with eu leaders in rome on thursday .
european concerns over the recent arrest of oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky dominated the talks . european union leaders questioned putin on the recent incarceration of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former head of oil giant yukos , on charges of fraud and tax evasion . " it 's crucial to keep the entire -lrb- legal -rrb- proceedings transparent and in unison with the norms of a constitutional state , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told russian reporters . prior to the meeting , eu leaders had already said they would ask putin to " clarify " the matter . critics see the arrest as an attempt to silence khodorkovsky , a billionaire businessman , who has openly supported russia 's political opposition . putin denies allegations of rising authoritarianism the russian president denied the allegations that he was trying control the justice system 's handling of the khodorkovsky affair .
instead , he said the arrest should not be seen as a sign of rising authoritarianism . " everyone has to obey the law at all times , " he told italian journalists .

putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .

" i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .
and his opinion could end up being key , especially since the project would end up being built in his front yard . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host biggest world cup ever germany 's world cup in 2006 will be the biggest ever after governing body fifa approved an enlargement plan increasing the number of teams from 32 to 36 .

russian president vladimir putin met with eu leaders in rome on thursday .
european concerns over the recent arrest of oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky dominated the talks . european union leaders questioned putin on the recent incarceration of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former head of oil giant yukos , on charges of fraud and tax evasion . " it 's crucial to keep the entire -lrb- legal -rrb- proceedings transparent and in unison with the norms of a constitutional state , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told russian reporters . prior to the meeting , eu leaders had already said they would ask putin to " clarify " the matter . critics see the arrest as an attempt to silence khodorkovsky , a billionaire businessman , who has openly supported russia 's political opposition . putin denies allegations of rising authoritarianism the russian president denied the allegations that he was trying control the justice system 's handling of the khodorkovsky affair .
instead , he said the arrest should not be seen as a sign of rising authoritarianism . " everyone has to obey the law at all times , " he told italian journalists .

putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .

" i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .

the eu considers lower prices an unfair advantage for russian companies who export their goods . talks on visa-free travel both sides agreed to work toward visa-free travel between eu member states and russia in the long term . eu leaders have rejected this idea so far , saying that russia 's border controls are too lax and russian passports not forgery-proof .

russian president vladimir putin met with eu leaders in rome on thursday .
european concerns over the recent arrest of oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky dominated the talks . european union leaders questioned putin on the recent incarceration of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former head of oil giant yukos , on charges of fraud and tax evasion . " it 's crucial to keep the entire -lrb- legal -rrb- proceedings transparent and in unison with the norms of a constitutional state , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told russian reporters . prior to the meeting , eu leaders had already said they would ask putin to " clarify " the matter . critics see the arrest as an attempt to silence khodorkovsky , a billionaire businessman , who has openly supported russia 's political opposition . putin denies allegations of rising authoritarianism the russian president denied the allegations that he was trying control the justice system 's handling of the khodorkovsky affair .
instead , he said the arrest should not be seen as a sign of rising authoritarianism . " everyone has to obey the law at all times , " he told italian journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky at the courthouse in moscow .
putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .
questioning the results of privatization in the 1990s was not an option , " even if they are far from ideal , " putin said . berlusconi defends putin italian premier silivo berlusconi , a close personal friend of putin 's , turned out to be his guest 's biggest supporter during the day . when journalists started asking putin about the yukos affair , berlusconi stepped in and explained that all suspicions against the russian were unfounded . italy , which currently holds the presidency and therefore hosted the summit , considers the khodorkovsky arrest an internal affair . " i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .
russia has been trying to join the organization for more than ten years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin , eu commission president prodi and eu foreign policy commissioner javier solana during a meeting last may .
before that happens , some issues have to be resolved , however . most recently , eu demands to raise russian energy prices to world market levels slowed down the process .
putin has rejected this , saying that higher prices would ruin russia 's economy . eu officials say that no one is asking russia to do more than other countries in a similar situation .
the eu considers lower prices an unfair advantage for russian companies who export their goods . talks on visa-free travel both sides agreed to work toward visa-free travel between eu member states and russia in the long term . eu leaders have rejected this idea so far , saying that russia 's border controls are too lax and russian passports not forgery-proof .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.11.2003 germany steps up its presence in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has a vested interest in promoting stability in africa not usually a focus of german foreign policy , relations with africa are generating more interest in berlin - not least as a result of the war on terror . there 's no overlooking the sudden flurry of interest on the part of germany 's statesmen .
berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy . " " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

russian president vladimir putin met with eu leaders in rome on thursday .
european concerns over the recent arrest of oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky dominated the talks . european union leaders questioned putin on the recent incarceration of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former head of oil giant yukos , on charges of fraud and tax evasion . " it 's crucial to keep the entire -lrb- legal -rrb- proceedings transparent and in unison with the norms of a constitutional state , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told russian reporters . prior to the meeting , eu leaders had already said they would ask putin to " clarify " the matter . critics see the arrest as an attempt to silence khodorkovsky , a billionaire businessman , who has openly supported russia 's political opposition . putin denies allegations of rising authoritarianism the russian president denied the allegations that he was trying control the justice system 's handling of the khodorkovsky affair .
instead , he said the arrest should not be seen as a sign of rising authoritarianism . " everyone has to obey the law at all times , " he told italian journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky at the courthouse in moscow .
putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .
questioning the results of privatization in the 1990s was not an option , " even if they are far from ideal , " putin said . berlusconi defends putin italian premier silivo berlusconi , a close personal friend of putin 's , turned out to be his guest 's biggest supporter during the day . when journalists started asking putin about the yukos affair , berlusconi stepped in and explained that all suspicions against the russian were unfounded . italy , which currently holds the presidency and therefore hosted the summit , considers the khodorkovsky arrest an internal affair . " i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .
russia has been trying to join the organization for more than ten years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin , eu commission president prodi and eu foreign policy commissioner javier solana during a meeting last may .
before that happens , some issues have to be resolved , however . most recently , eu demands to raise russian energy prices to world market levels slowed down the process .
putin has rejected this , saying that higher prices would ruin russia 's economy . eu officials say that no one is asking russia to do more than other countries in a similar situation .
the eu considers lower prices an unfair advantage for russian companies who export their goods . talks on visa-free travel both sides agreed to work toward visa-free travel between eu member states and russia in the long term . eu leaders have rejected this idea so far , saying that russia 's border controls are too lax and russian passports not forgery-proof .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy . " " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.11.2003 a patchwork soccer pitch for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project would bring soccer to the heart of berlin .
a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .
and his opinion could end up being key , especially since the project would end up being built in his front yard . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host biggest world cup ever germany 's world cup in 2006 will be the biggest ever after governing body fifa approved an enlargement plan increasing the number of teams from 32 to 36 .
however , the decision has caused divisions within the game .

russian president vladimir putin met with eu leaders in rome on thursday .
european concerns over the recent arrest of oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky dominated the talks . european union leaders questioned putin on the recent incarceration of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former head of oil giant yukos , on charges of fraud and tax evasion . " it 's crucial to keep the entire -lrb- legal -rrb- proceedings transparent and in unison with the norms of a constitutional state , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told russian reporters . prior to the meeting , eu leaders had already said they would ask putin to " clarify " the matter . critics see the arrest as an attempt to silence khodorkovsky , a billionaire businessman , who has openly supported russia 's political opposition . putin denies allegations of rising authoritarianism the russian president denied the allegations that he was trying control the justice system 's handling of the khodorkovsky affair .
instead , he said the arrest should not be seen as a sign of rising authoritarianism . " everyone has to obey the law at all times , " he told italian journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky at the courthouse in moscow .
putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .
questioning the results of privatization in the 1990s was not an option , " even if they are far from ideal , " putin said . berlusconi defends putin italian premier silivo berlusconi , a close personal friend of putin 's , turned out to be his guest 's biggest supporter during the day . when journalists started asking putin about the yukos affair , berlusconi stepped in and explained that all suspicions against the russian were unfounded . italy , which currently holds the presidency and therefore hosted the summit , considers the khodorkovsky arrest an internal affair . " i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .

before that happens , some issues have to be resolved , however . most recently , eu demands to raise russian energy prices to world market levels slowed down the process .
putin has rejected this , saying that higher prices would ruin russia 's economy . eu officials say that no one is asking russia to do more than other countries in a similar situation .
the eu considers lower prices an unfair advantage for russian companies who export their goods . talks on visa-free travel both sides agreed to work toward visa-free travel between eu member states and russia in the long term . eu leaders have rejected this idea so far , saying that russia 's border controls are too lax and russian passports not forgery-proof .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.11.2003 a patchwork soccer pitch for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project would bring soccer to the heart of berlin .
a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .
and his opinion could end up being key , especially since the project would end up being built in his front yard . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host biggest world cup ever germany 's world cup in 2006 will be the biggest ever after governing body fifa approved an enlargement plan increasing the number of teams from 32 to 36 .
however , the decision has caused divisions within the game .

russian president vladimir putin met with eu leaders in rome on thursday .
european concerns over the recent arrest of oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky dominated the talks . european union leaders questioned putin on the recent incarceration of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former head of oil giant yukos , on charges of fraud and tax evasion . " it 's crucial to keep the entire -lrb- legal -rrb- proceedings transparent and in unison with the norms of a constitutional state , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told russian reporters . prior to the meeting , eu leaders had already said they would ask putin to " clarify " the matter . critics see the arrest as an attempt to silence khodorkovsky , a billionaire businessman , who has openly supported russia 's political opposition . putin denies allegations of rising authoritarianism the russian president denied the allegations that he was trying control the justice system 's handling of the khodorkovsky affair .
instead , he said the arrest should not be seen as a sign of rising authoritarianism . " everyone has to obey the law at all times , " he told italian journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky at the courthouse in moscow .
putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .
questioning the results of privatization in the 1990s was not an option , " even if they are far from ideal , " putin said . berlusconi defends putin italian premier silivo berlusconi , a close personal friend of putin 's , turned out to be his guest 's biggest supporter during the day . when journalists started asking putin about the yukos affair , berlusconi stepped in and explained that all suspicions against the russian were unfounded . italy , which currently holds the presidency and therefore hosted the summit , considers the khodorkovsky arrest an internal affair . " i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .
russia has been trying to join the organization for more than ten years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin , eu commission president prodi and eu foreign policy commissioner javier solana during a meeting last may .
before that happens , some issues have to be resolved , however . most recently , eu demands to raise russian energy prices to world market levels slowed down the process .
putin has rejected this , saying that higher prices would ruin russia 's economy . eu officials say that no one is asking russia to do more than other countries in a similar situation .
the eu considers lower prices an unfair advantage for russian companies who export their goods . talks on visa-free travel both sides agreed to work toward visa-free travel between eu member states and russia in the long term . eu leaders have rejected this idea so far , saying that russia 's border controls are too lax and russian passports not forgery-proof .
prior to the visit , putin said he hoped russian citizens would soon be able to enter eu member states without a visa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans troubled by russian oil tycoon ’ s case berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.11.2003 a patchwork soccer pitch for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project would bring soccer to the heart of berlin .
a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .
and his opinion could end up being key , especially since the project would end up being built in his front yard . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host biggest world cup ever germany 's world cup in 2006 will be the biggest ever after governing body fifa approved an enlargement plan increasing the number of teams from 32 to 36 .
however , the decision has caused divisions within the game .

berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy . " " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.11.2003 germany steps up its presence in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has a vested interest in promoting stability in africa not usually a focus of german foreign policy , relations with africa are generating more interest in berlin - not least as a result of the war on terror . there 's no overlooking the sudden flurry of interest on the part of germany 's statesmen .
berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy . " " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .
pensioner advocates accused the government of breaching a promise to bring pensions in the former east germany up to west german standards .
the freeze would prevent this for years to come , the president of the national pensioners ' association told a local newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pension cuts draw fire schröder 's cuts could come back to haunt him as greying germans take to the polls in 2006 .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .
pensioner advocates accused the government of breaching a promise to bring pensions in the former east germany up to west german standards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.11.2003 germany steps up its presence in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has a vested interest in promoting stability in africa not usually a focus of german foreign policy , relations with africa are generating more interest in berlin - not least as a result of the war on terror . there 's no overlooking the sudden flurry of interest on the part of germany 's statesmen .
berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy . " " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy .

both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .

mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .
pensioner advocates accused the government of breaching a promise to bring pensions in the former east germany up to west german standards .
the freeze would prevent this for years to come , the president of the national pensioners ' association told a local newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pension cuts draw fire schröder 's cuts could come back to haunt him as greying germans take to the polls in 2006 .

but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .
pensioner advocates accused the government of breaching a promise to bring pensions in the former east germany up to west german standards .
the freeze would prevent this for years to come , the president of the national pensioners ' association told a local newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pension cuts draw fire schröder 's cuts could come back to haunt him as greying germans take to the polls in 2006 .

russian president vladimir putin met with eu leaders in rome on thursday .
european concerns over the recent arrest of oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky dominated the talks . european union leaders questioned putin on the recent incarceration of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former head of oil giant yukos , on charges of fraud and tax evasion .

putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .

" i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .
pensioner advocates accused the government of breaching a promise to bring pensions in the former east germany up to west german standards .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.11.2003 a patchwork soccer pitch for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project would bring soccer to the heart of berlin .
a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.11.2003 germany steps up its presence in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has a vested interest in promoting stability in africa not usually a focus of german foreign policy , relations with africa are generating more interest in berlin - not least as a result of the war on terror . there 's no overlooking the sudden flurry of interest on the part of germany 's statesmen .
berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy . " " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .
pensioner advocates accused the government of breaching a promise to bring pensions in the former east germany up to west german standards .
the freeze would prevent this for years to come , the president of the national pensioners ' association told a local newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pension cuts draw fire schröder 's cuts could come back to haunt him as greying germans take to the polls in 2006 .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .
and his opinion could end up being key , especially since the project would end up being built in his front yard . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host biggest world cup ever germany 's world cup in 2006 will be the biggest ever after governing body fifa approved an enlargement plan increasing the number of teams from 32 to 36 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.11.2003 germany steps up its presence in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has a vested interest in promoting stability in africa not usually a focus of german foreign policy , relations with africa are generating more interest in berlin - not least as a result of the war on terror . there 's no overlooking the sudden flurry of interest on the part of germany 's statesmen .
berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy . " " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.11.2003 the european union strikes back großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even u.s. honey will be taxed .
the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .
pensioner advocates accused the government of breaching a promise to bring pensions in the former east germany up to west german standards .
the freeze would prevent this for years to come , the president of the national pensioners ' association told a local newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pension cuts draw fire schröder 's cuts could come back to haunt him as greying germans take to the polls in 2006 .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.11.2003 a patchwork soccer pitch for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project would bring soccer to the heart of berlin .
a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .
and his opinion could end up being key , especially since the project would end up being built in his front yard . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host biggest world cup ever germany 's world cup in 2006 will be the biggest ever after governing body fifa approved an enlargement plan increasing the number of teams from 32 to 36 .

russian president vladimir putin met with eu leaders in rome on thursday .
european concerns over the recent arrest of oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky dominated the talks . european union leaders questioned putin on the recent incarceration of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former head of oil giant yukos , on charges of fraud and tax evasion . " it 's crucial to keep the entire -lrb- legal -rrb- proceedings transparent and in unison with the norms of a constitutional state , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told russian reporters . prior to the meeting , eu leaders had already said they would ask putin to " clarify " the matter . critics see the arrest as an attempt to silence khodorkovsky , a billionaire businessman , who has openly supported russia 's political opposition . putin denies allegations of rising authoritarianism the russian president denied the allegations that he was trying control the justice system 's handling of the khodorkovsky affair .
instead , he said the arrest should not be seen as a sign of rising authoritarianism . " everyone has to obey the law at all times , " he told italian journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky at the courthouse in moscow .
putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .
questioning the results of privatization in the 1990s was not an option , " even if they are far from ideal , " putin said . berlusconi defends putin italian premier silivo berlusconi , a close personal friend of putin 's , turned out to be his guest 's biggest supporter during the day . when journalists started asking putin about the yukos affair , berlusconi stepped in and explained that all suspicions against the russian were unfounded . italy , which currently holds the presidency and therefore hosted the summit , considers the khodorkovsky arrest an internal affair . " i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .
russia has been trying to join the organization for more than ten years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin , eu commission president prodi and eu foreign policy commissioner javier solana during a meeting last may .
before that happens , some issues have to be resolved , however . most recently , eu demands to raise russian energy prices to world market levels slowed down the process .
putin has rejected this , saying that higher prices would ruin russia 's economy . eu officials say that no one is asking russia to do more than other countries in a similar situation .
the eu considers lower prices an unfair advantage for russian companies who export their goods . talks on visa-free travel both sides agreed to work toward visa-free travel between eu member states and russia in the long term . eu leaders have rejected this idea so far , saying that russia 's border controls are too lax and russian passports not forgery-proof .

putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .
pensioner advocates accused the government of breaching a promise to bring pensions in the former east germany up to west german standards .
the freeze would prevent this for years to come , the president of the national pensioners ' association told a local newspaper . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de pension cuts draw fire schröder 's cuts could come back to haunt him as greying germans take to the polls in 2006 .

putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .

" i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .

putin has rejected this , saying that higher prices would ruin russia 's economy . eu officials say that no one is asking russia to do more than other countries in a similar situation .
the eu considers lower prices an unfair advantage for russian companies who export their goods . talks on visa-free travel both sides agreed to work toward visa-free travel between eu member states and russia in the long term . eu leaders have rejected this idea so far , saying that russia 's border controls are too lax and russian passports not forgery-proof .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

russian president vladimir putin met with eu leaders in rome on thursday .
european concerns over the recent arrest of oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky dominated the talks . european union leaders questioned putin on the recent incarceration of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former head of oil giant yukos , on charges of fraud and tax evasion . " it 's crucial to keep the entire -lrb- legal -rrb- proceedings transparent and in unison with the norms of a constitutional state , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told russian reporters . prior to the meeting , eu leaders had already said they would ask putin to " clarify " the matter . critics see the arrest as an attempt to silence khodorkovsky , a billionaire businessman , who has openly supported russia 's political opposition . putin denies allegations of rising authoritarianism the russian president denied the allegations that he was trying control the justice system 's handling of the khodorkovsky affair .
instead , he said the arrest should not be seen as a sign of rising authoritarianism . " everyone has to obey the law at all times , " he told italian journalists .

putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .
questioning the results of privatization in the 1990s was not an option , " even if they are far from ideal , " putin said . berlusconi defends putin italian premier silivo berlusconi , a close personal friend of putin 's , turned out to be his guest 's biggest supporter during the day . when journalists started asking putin about the yukos affair , berlusconi stepped in and explained that all suspicions against the russian were unfounded . italy , which currently holds the presidency and therefore hosted the summit , considers the khodorkovsky arrest an internal affair . " i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .
russia has been trying to join the organization for more than ten years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin , eu commission president prodi and eu foreign policy commissioner javier solana during a meeting last may .
before that happens , some issues have to be resolved , however . most recently , eu demands to raise russian energy prices to world market levels slowed down the process .
putin has rejected this , saying that higher prices would ruin russia 's economy . eu officials say that no one is asking russia to do more than other countries in a similar situation .
the eu considers lower prices an unfair advantage for russian companies who export their goods . talks on visa-free travel both sides agreed to work toward visa-free travel between eu member states and russia in the long term . eu leaders have rejected this idea so far , saying that russia 's border controls are too lax and russian passports not forgery-proof .
prior to the visit , putin said he hoped russian citizens would soon be able to enter eu member states without a visa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans troubled by russian oil tycoon ’ s case berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .
pensioner advocates accused the government of breaching a promise to bring pensions in the former east germany up to west german standards .

nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 06.11.2003 a patchwork soccer pitch for germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the project would bring soccer to the heart of berlin .
a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .
and his opinion could end up being key , especially since the project would end up being built in his front yard . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host biggest world cup ever germany 's world cup in 2006 will be the biggest ever after governing body fifa approved an enlargement plan increasing the number of teams from 32 to 36 .
however , the decision has caused divisions within the game .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.11.2003 germany steps up its presence in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has a vested interest in promoting stability in africa not usually a focus of german foreign policy , relations with africa are generating more interest in berlin - not least as a result of the war on terror . there 's no overlooking the sudden flurry of interest on the part of germany 's statesmen .
berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy . " " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2011 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .
and his opinion could end up being key , especially since the project would end up being built in his front yard . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host biggest world cup ever germany 's world cup in 2006 will be the biggest ever after governing body fifa approved an enlargement plan increasing the number of teams from 32 to 36 .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .
and his opinion could end up being key , especially since the project would end up being built in his front yard . marc young send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany to host biggest world cup ever germany 's world cup in 2006 will be the biggest ever after governing body fifa approved an enlargement plan increasing the number of teams from 32 to 36 .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .
in this case , the eu has won the right to respond by imposing punitive import tariffs worth $ 2.2 billion . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu draws up hit list for sanctions on us products in a long-running dispute over a u.s. corporate tax break , the european union has published a list of u.s. products it is threatening to target with 4 billion euro in sanctions -lrb- sept .

russian president vladimir putin met with eu leaders in rome on thursday .
european concerns over the recent arrest of oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky dominated the talks . european union leaders questioned putin on the recent incarceration of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former head of oil giant yukos , on charges of fraud and tax evasion . " it 's crucial to keep the entire -lrb- legal -rrb- proceedings transparent and in unison with the norms of a constitutional state , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told russian reporters . prior to the meeting , eu leaders had already said they would ask putin to " clarify " the matter . critics see the arrest as an attempt to silence khodorkovsky , a billionaire businessman , who has openly supported russia 's political opposition . putin denies allegations of rising authoritarianism the russian president denied the allegations that he was trying control the justice system 's handling of the khodorkovsky affair .
instead , he said the arrest should not be seen as a sign of rising authoritarianism . " everyone has to obey the law at all times , " he told italian journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky at the courthouse in moscow .
putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .
questioning the results of privatization in the 1990s was not an option , " even if they are far from ideal , " putin said . berlusconi defends putin italian premier silivo berlusconi , a close personal friend of putin 's , turned out to be his guest 's biggest supporter during the day . when journalists started asking putin about the yukos affair , berlusconi stepped in and explained that all suspicions against the russian were unfounded . italy , which currently holds the presidency and therefore hosted the summit , considers the khodorkovsky arrest an internal affair . " i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .
russia has been trying to join the organization for more than ten years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin , eu commission president prodi and eu foreign policy commissioner javier solana during a meeting last may .
before that happens , some issues have to be resolved , however . most recently , eu demands to raise russian energy prices to world market levels slowed down the process .
putin has rejected this , saying that higher prices would ruin russia 's economy . eu officials say that no one is asking russia to do more than other countries in a similar situation .
the eu considers lower prices an unfair advantage for russian companies who export their goods . talks on visa-free travel both sides agreed to work toward visa-free travel between eu member states and russia in the long term . eu leaders have rejected this idea so far , saying that russia 's border controls are too lax and russian passports not forgery-proof .
prior to the visit , putin said he hoped russian citizens would soon be able to enter eu member states without a visa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans troubled by russian oil tycoon ’ s case berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .

the long-standing trade dispute between the eu and the united states on u.s. tax breaks for exporters has taken a new twist .
if washington does not change its policies , the eu will begin slapping duties on u.s. imports . the european commission plans to impose additional tariffs on selected u.s. products beginning next year .
the move comes as a response to the dispute over u.s. tax concessions for exporters , which have been a point of contention between washington and brussels for years .
u.s. tax law allows domestic exporters to set up mailbox companies in tax havens such as the virgin islands or barbados .
the company 's exports are then processed via this offshore address which offers more favorable tax conditions .
the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- originally gave the united states until november 1 , 2000 , to withdraw its so-called foreign sales corporations -lrb- fsc -rrb- scheme .
but the united states has been slow to respond .
now the eu is putting pressure on the u.s. to remove what it calls unfair subsidies .
" the commission hopes to pass a very clear message to the united states that their continued failure to implement -lsb- the withdrawal -rrb- three years after the expiry of the original wto deadline is unacceptable , " eu trade commissioner pascal lamy said in a statement .
in may 2003 , the wto gave the eu the final go-ahead to impose duties of up to $ 4 billion following the failure of the united states to comply with the previous wto rulings .
under the proposed plan , the countermeasures will be introduced gradually starting from march 1 , 2004 , and will be added on to products ranging from meat to jewelry and textiles to parts for nuclear reactors .
before the duties go into effect , the eu member states need to adopt the proposal .
leaving the door open because the fsc scheme can bring u.s. companies tax breaks of up to 30 percent , many american-based companies are able to offer goods on foreign markets for prices significantly below those of the competition .
the eu says the fsc system involves hidden government subsidies , which discriminate against european competitors .
however , as trade commissioner lamy pointed out , the eu wanted to give the u.s. administration a reasonable time period to adopt the necessary legislation to repeal the fsc structure .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pascal lamy " we have opted for a measured approach and have actually left the door open for u.s. action before countermeasures are to be applied in march 2004 , " said lamy -lrb- photo -rrb- .
the commission 's proposal provides for a gradual imposition of tariffs , starting at just 5 percent .
this will be followed by automatic , monthly increases of 1 percent up to a ceiling of 17 percent to be reached in march 2005 .
" i hope the united states will seize this opportunity , " lamy said .
a counterproductive approach according to reuters news agency , the u.s. ambassador to the eu , rockwell schnabel , called brussels ' approach " unhelpful . "
he repeated the u.s. stance that any solution needs to be phased in over three additional years .
" something is going to happen -lrb- in congress -rrb- , so at this stage to retaliate , we think , is counterproductive , " he said speaking at a lunch meeting on wednesday .
u.s. trade representative robert zoellick told lamy , who was in washington earlier this week , that the u.s. administration was working hard on the " very difficult tax and trade issue , " accoding to his spokesman richard mills .
" given the eu 's focus on compliance with the wto ruling , we would expect the eu to work with us to solve the problem , not retaliate , " mills said .
independent of the fsc dispute , the eu and the united states are also fighting over u.s. protective tarifs on steel imports imposed by president george w. bush .

russian president vladimir putin met with eu leaders in rome on thursday .
european concerns over the recent arrest of oil magnate mikhail khodorkovsky dominated the talks . european union leaders questioned putin on the recent incarceration of mikhail khodorkovsky , the former head of oil giant yukos , on charges of fraud and tax evasion . " it 's crucial to keep the entire -lrb- legal -rrb- proceedings transparent and in unison with the norms of a constitutional state , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana told russian reporters . prior to the meeting , eu leaders had already said they would ask putin to " clarify " the matter . critics see the arrest as an attempt to silence khodorkovsky , a billionaire businessman , who has openly supported russia 's political opposition . putin denies allegations of rising authoritarianism the russian president denied the allegations that he was trying control the justice system 's handling of the khodorkovsky affair .
instead , he said the arrest should not be seen as a sign of rising authoritarianism . " everyone has to obey the law at all times , " he told italian journalists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mikhail khodorkovsky at the courthouse in moscow .
putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .
questioning the results of privatization in the 1990s was not an option , " even if they are far from ideal , " putin said . berlusconi defends putin italian premier silivo berlusconi , a close personal friend of putin 's , turned out to be his guest 's biggest supporter during the day . when journalists started asking putin about the yukos affair , berlusconi stepped in and explained that all suspicions against the russian were unfounded . italy , which currently holds the presidency and therefore hosted the summit , considers the khodorkovsky arrest an internal affair . " i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .
russia has been trying to join the organization for more than ten years . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin , eu commission president prodi and eu foreign policy commissioner javier solana during a meeting last may .
before that happens , some issues have to be resolved , however . most recently , eu demands to raise russian energy prices to world market levels slowed down the process .
putin has rejected this , saying that higher prices would ruin russia 's economy . eu officials say that no one is asking russia to do more than other countries in a similar situation .
the eu considers lower prices an unfair advantage for russian companies who export their goods . talks on visa-free travel both sides agreed to work toward visa-free travel between eu member states and russia in the long term . eu leaders have rejected this idea so far , saying that russia 's border controls are too lax and russian passports not forgery-proof .
prior to the visit , putin said he hoped russian citizens would soon be able to enter eu member states without a visa . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans troubled by russian oil tycoon ’ s case berlin has asked vladimir putin to reassure russia ’ s biggest trading partner that it will apply rule of law in its case against yukos chairman mikhail khodorkovsky .

putin also expressed his hope that the russian authorities for natural resources would not evoke yukos ’ exploration licences .
such an action would lead people to believe that his government was trying to keep yukos from conducting its business , putin said . he added that his government did not plan a general clamping down on russia 's business sector .

" i will charge one euro for this defense , " berlusconi joked after he had finished .
" i will gladly pay one euro , " putin responded . eu leaders will support russia 's wto application despite tensions over the khodorkovsky issue , eu leaders and putin also managed to talk about other matters during the summit , the twelfth such biannual meeting . the eu delegation will support russia in its efforts to join the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- by the end of 2004 .

berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy . " " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 06.11.2003 germany steps up its presence in africa großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community has a vested interest in promoting stability in africa not usually a focus of german foreign policy , relations with africa are generating more interest in berlin - not least as a result of the war on terror . there 's no overlooking the sudden flurry of interest on the part of germany 's statesmen .
berlin seems to have put german-african relations at the top of the agenda , with german chancellor gerhard schröder planning a trip in january 2004 and president johannes rau also set to visit soon .
in early october , development minister heidemarie wieczorek-zeul spent four days in kenya for top-level talks on corruption , constitutional reform , aids issues and germany 's 25 million euros in financial aid .
foreign minister joschka fischer , meanwhile , last week made a five-day visit to mali , namibia and south africa . he was accompanied by andreas mehler , director of the institute for african affairs in hamburg , who told deutsche welle that " africa has never played a large role in germany 's foreign policy . " " but i believe that the foreign minister will now take a number of positive impressions home with him from his trip , and that ca n't hurt germany 's policy on africa , and it may well boost interest , " he said at the end of fischer 's visit . the forgotten continent so what 's behind germany 's renewed interest in africa ?
both imports and exports from africa have fallen , and the only countries with economic clout are south africa and nigeria .
nonetheless , during his visit joschka fischer was quick to emphasize that " in the globalized world of the 21st century , the african nations will have a role to play - a role they must play .
we can not allow a neighboring continent of this size to be left outside the world economy and globalization , and that calls for a common effort . " the first step towards a common effort is opening up the world economy to african countries and ensuring fair trading terms for developing nations .
according to andreas mehler , germany " could also cultivate other interests in africa .
for example , we 'd like to see the values enshrined in our basic law respected in africa .
these are normative interests , such as democracy , human rights and so on . " he adds that " after september 11 , at the very latest , we realized that these values are bound up with our security .
poverty , combined with a lack of education and perspective , create breeding grounds for terrorism . " the growing terror threat mehler 's comments highlight a key issue .
today , an unstable africa has immediate repercussions for europe .
mehler points out that if lawless regions arise in africa , as is currently happening , then these can serve as a refuge for international terrorists , adding that " for this reason , it 's important that we focus attention on the african continent . " his comments were echoed in berlin on tuesday , when nato 's top soldier , u.s. general james jones told a press conference that " africa , with its large ungoverned spaces , is increasingly going to be a haven for terrorists , for merchants of weapons of mass destruction and for people engaged in illegal international activities . " joschka fischer agrees .
but while nato 's supreme allied commander in europe described improving security and training local armed forces as one solution , fischer sees another way forward . speaking in south africa , he referred to the growing political awareness that " the iraq crisis , the terrorist threat and ongoing globalization illustrate that we live in a world in which security can not be guaranteed by arms , it has to entail development , in the broader sense . " development aid as peace policy in the 1990s , the german foreign office shut a number of embassies and consulates and cut back development aid .
now it 's once again stepping up its presence .
africa is still the main recipient of german aid funds even though while he was in south africa fischer stressed that germany 's current economic difficulties would have to be overcome before financial support could be delivered .
he described germany as being " in a difficult budgetary situation , " but added that " this is temporary and does not mean we are withdrawing co-operation or canceling financial support . " another advantage to cultivating ties with africa emerged during fischer 's visit .
while in mali , the german foreign minister formally thanked the country for its role in freeing the fourteen european hostages kidnapped in the sahara earlier this year , saying that president amadou toumai touré 's intervention on the tourists ' behalf was a key factor in their release . the president responded by saying that germany always gives - and it had been a honor for him to help germany , for once . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de fischer delivers rallying call to african nations german foreign minister joschka fischer issued a rallying call to all african nations to help solve the problems in zimbabwe during his visit to south africa on thursday -lrb- october 31 , 2003 -rrb- www-links organization for european cooperation and development international organisation which helps governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalised economy bundesministerium für wirtschaftliche zusammenarbeit und entwicklung german ministry for economic cooperation and development 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .
experts had previously said that without the emergency reforms , germany 's pension system would lack at least € 8 billion -lrb- $ 9.1 billion -rrb- .
the move will save the system about € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.5 billion -rrb- .
a reduction in pension fund reserves will save another € 4.7 billion -lrb- $ 5.3 billion -rrb- .
opposition calls reforms a " fiasco " but opposition leaders called the reforms a " fiasco , " saying that parliament would have to deal with the issue again next year to avoid deficits in the pension system in 2005 .
opposition leader angela merkel , who heads the christian democrat union , called for a long-term reform of germany 's pension system instead of repeat emergency fixes .
the government does not need the support of the second parliamentary chamber , the opposition-ruled bundesrat , in order to freeze pensions and change the nursing insurance coverage .
christian democrats , who dominate the bundesrat , could only block a decision to move the payment of pensions to the end of the month , an additional plan put forth by the government to save the pension system another € 600 million -lrb- $ 687.3 million -rrb- in the short-term .
pensioners , trade union leaders oppose measures trade union leaders also criticized the reforms , saying that raising worker contributions to the pension system might be necessary to ensure that pensions stay at or near the current level .
pensioner advocates accused the government of breaching a promise to bring pensions in the former east germany up to west german standards .

german pensioners will get less money next year after parliament voted to cap pensions and require the elderly to pay for nursing insurance .
supporters claim this cuts labor costs and boosts economic recovery . for the first time in postwar germany , pensions will not rise to correspond to inflation rates .
in a vote split along party lines , germany ’ s parliament on thursday voted to freeze pension payments for the next year .
chancellor gerhard schröder ’ s coalition government of social democrats and greens plugged the emergency plan as a last-ditch measure to preventing a rise in contributions to the statutory pension system , but the opposition christian democrat union was not convinced it was the right solution and voted against it .
as it stands now , workers pay 19.5 percent of their wages to the pension fund .
but because of the changing demographics in germany and the rising number of jobless , fewer and fewer people are paying into the system .
in order to counteract this trend , contributions have been increased in the past , but analysts and government officials say they have reached their limit at nearly 20 percent of overall income .
something else has to change instead .
therefore starting in january , there will be a freeze on inflation-adjusted increases in pensions for 2003 and from now on elderly people will be required to carry the full cost of nursing insurance .
taken together , the two moves effectively turn the freeze into a reduction of pensions .
without the measure , however , an average pension of € 1,000 -lrb- $ 1,145 -rrb- a month would have risen by about € 10 -lrb- $ 11 -rrb- next july .
filling the hole , speeding up recovery the government sees thursday ’ s vote as a crucial step to keeping non-wage labor costs from rising any further and hopes that the reforms will help put germany back on the road to economic recovery after three years of near-recession .

a group of students is hoping to get germans warmed up for the 2006 world cup by piecing together a “ national pitch ” made up of squares of turf from over 5,000 soccer fields .
location ?
right in front of the reichstag . it still may be three years to go until germany hosts the world cup , but preparations for soccer ’ s greatest event are already well underway .
stadiums are being refurbished and facilities upgraded .
the sport ’ s governing body fifa has even sent a giant soccer ball on tour around germany ’ s main cities to get the public fired up . but for a few enterprising berlin students , the traveling fifa ball and its exhibits isn ’ t enough to spread a good case of “ football fever ” around the country .
their idea ?
create a so-called “ national pitch ” consisting of 5,888 pieces of lawn from different german soccer fields . the nationalfeld , as the project is called in german , would then be assembled on the lawn right in front of the reichstag on the platz der republik .
“ there ’ s no other so worthy place in germany .
it ’ s got to be there , ” marc friedrich , one of the project ’ s organizers told dw-world , explaining how the central location would help get people excited and feel involved in the country ’ s first world cup since west germany hosted the event in 1974 . the lawn wedged between the reichstag - germany ’ s parliament building - and the residence and office of chancellor gerhard schröder actually has a history of being used for local soccer scrimmages .
but unfortunately that may not necessarily bode well for friedrich ’ s project , since the sports fans were evicted from the space in a row with berlin city officials hoping to make it a well-kept green area at the heart of the capital . problems on the pitch “ we ’ re aware there were some problems in the past with soccer there , but we didn ’ t have anything to do with that , ” friedrich said , adding the project was meant to be of a temporary nature only for the world cup .
“ after that it would be back to normal . ” joachim zeller , the local councilman in charge of berlin ’ s mitte district where the pitch would be built reportedly called the idea of bringing soccer back to the platz der republik a “ bad joke . ”
but city spokeswoman karin rietz said his criticism was solely focused on the feasibility of the project .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : www.nationalfeld.de “ from what i understand you can ’ t really play on a pitch that ’ s made up of lots of separate pieces - i believe that ’ s what mr. zeller was referring to , ” said rietz . however , considering the pitch isn ’ t meant to be used for regulation matches , it ’ s doubtful many hobby soccer players would have objections to kicking the ball around a checkerboard field with grass from all corners of the nation . friedrich , a 31-year-old sports science major , said the pitch would be used for exhibition games and for other events designed to get normal people behind the ball .
the project , estimated to cost around € 2.5 million -lrb- $ 2.9 million -rrb- , would include a steel and concrete structure framing the pitch . although the nationalfeld hasn ’ t even been approved yet , at least three soccer clubs have already pledged a 1.22 meter by 1.22 meter square of turf for the field .
the students have also received encouragement from high-profile soccer fans like zdf television match commentator johannes b. kerner . the nation ’ s top soccer aficionado - chancellor schröder - has yet to make his views on the nationalfeld know .

it was discovered on a construction site in the butts near to a small section of the surviving medieval city wall .
it has now been refilled to allow a pathway to be built over the top of it .
archaeologist mike napthan , who made the discovery , said it was the first roman structure to be found in the city intact .
he said it proved that romans continued to live in the area into the fourth century .
archaeologists first thought the well was medieval , but artefacts recovered from inside it during excavation prove it was in use in about 380 ad .
it is hoped the artefacts found inside the well will be put on display at the city 's museum .

the six towns to get a slice of the £ 4.9m are blackpool in lancashire , ramsgate in kent , penzance in cornwall , torquay in devon , ryde on the isle of wight , and dovercourt in essex .
more than £ 144m has already been ploughed in to seaside towns from the heritage lottery fund , which is also responsible for the latest cash injection .
gordon marsden , president of the british resorts association , said : " this is a very welcome response from the heritage lottery fund to the issues i and others have raised about the link between regeneration and seaside revival . "
' social hardships ' carole souter , the fund 's director , said : " everyone loves the seaside , and resorts play an important role in the uk 's tourist economy .
" they are also part of our collective heritage , providing many people with happy holiday memories .
" however , despite being popular destinations some of these towns are suffering from real economic and social hardships . "
the proposed grant of just over £ 1m to blackpool includes money for the repair and restoration of 66 historic buildings in the talbot square area of the town .
about £ 750,000 has been earmarked for ramsgate 's historic seafront , more than £ 1.2m is being invested in the commercial core of penzance , and £ 600,000 will be used to improve run down areas of torquay 's waterfront .
ryde has won £ 750,000 to carry out urgent repairs on buildings on the town 's esplanade , while £ 460,000 for dovercourt will focus on improving residential and commercial properties in its conservation area .

figures from the office for national statistics showed people now owed an average of £ 5,330 in unsecured debt , which excludes mortgages , according to the liberal democrats .
the figures come as the bank of england 's monetary policy committee is widely tipped to raise rates by 0.25 % to 3.75 % - the first rise in almost four years .
in recent months i have become concerned about a culture of complacency in the uk with too few people willing to take action to address their personal financial situation malcolm hurlston , consumer credit counselling service vince cable , lib dem shadow chancellor , said : " with interest rates set to start rising immediately , the ticking debt time bomb is now set to explode .
" many people who have borrowed to the limit are going to regret pushing their debts up so high . "
debt adviser debt free direct also warned a rates rise could lead to a dramatic increase in the number of people going bankrupt .
debt fears chief executive andrew redmond said : " interest rates are at their lowest level since the 1950s and people are borrowing more and more money .
he added around 16 % of people have debts of £ 10,000 to £ 40,000 - before their mortgages are taken into account .
" many are finding it increasingly difficult to make their interest repayments and , if the bank of england base rate rises over the coming months as many people are predicting , there could be a dramatic rise in personal bankruptcies , " mr redmond warned .
the figures came as research for cpp group , which offers credit protection products , found that one in four people are now worried they will not be able to keep up with debt repayments in the next three months .
of 2,000 people surveyed by research company rsgb around 29 % said they were in danger of falling behind with their mortgage payments .
meanwhile , 22 % feared they will not be able to pay their council tax and 12 % thought they would be unable to keep up with their credit card payments .
but more research , released by morgan stanley , showed that despite the concerns credit card spending is set to soar in coming months as more people use their plastic to pay for christmas .
christmas spree britons plan to spend an average of £ 1,284 on their credit cards in the three months to the end of december - 42 % more than they thought they would spend in the previous three months .

the consumer credit counselling service , which offers advice on debt , has urged people to re-assess their budgets so they can meet existing commitments if rates go up .
chairman malcolm hurlston said : " in recent months i have become concerned about a culture of complacency in the uk with too few people willing to take action to address their personal financial situation .

in efforts to get more people to consider adoption , it hopes to offer prospective parents stronger support and better training for their new role .
children would also be given a bigger say than at present , with their views made part of the adoption process .
the british association for adoption & fostering said the plans to change the system , the first in 20 years , were " vitally important " .
' hugely rewarding ' children 's minister margaret hodge saidd the new measures , published for consultation during national adoption week , would help more children find " permanent and loving families " .
she said : " considering adoption is a big step , but bringing a child of any age into a caring loving family can be a hugely rewarding experience .
" i hope more people think about doing it . "
mrs hodge said the number of children adopted had risen 25 % over the past year , but that more still needed to be done .
she said the new measures would mean : better information about the children being adopted , including details about their life so far more consistent preparation , support and training for adoptive parents children will be asked their views and have their wishes taken into account prospective adopters will have a right to a review if their adoption agency recommends they are rejected less bureaucracy for parents wishing to adopt from overseas the consultation , which runs until 1 may 2004 , will involve all parties involved in adoption , the government said .
it also announced that the british association for adoption & fostering -lrb- baaf -rrb- had been awarded the job of setting up a review body to oversee the decisions of local adoption agencies .
the baaf said the new measures would " increase public confidence in the adoption process and make it more clear and transparent " .

most analysts expect a rise of a quarter of a percentage point from the current 48-year low of 3.5 % .
chancellor gordon brown has signalled his support for a rise in rates against a backdrop of " economic strengthening " .
speaking on the bbc 's breakfast television programme , mr brown said : " our concern since we came to power in 1997 has been to provide a stable environment for home owners and business .
" the bank of england and treasury want to lock that stability into the economy .

ms hanson , founder of the anti-immigration one nation party , left jail on thursday .
" i got caught up in a system that i saw fail me and i am so concerned now for the other women behind the bars ... and men , " she said .
the party 's co-founder , david ettridge , has also seen his conviction quashed .
ms hanson 's appeal was upheld unanimously by three judges on the queensland court of appeal .
this red-haired , hard-edged , twice-divorced mother of four shook the political establishment profile of pauline hanson they said her conviction was unsafe .
ms hanson , 49 , was not in court for the hearing , but a small group of her friends and family welcomed the decision .
her sister , judy smith , told reporters : " i am angry that she has been 11 weeks in jail where she should n't have been . "
ms hanson 's supporters are now demanding a national inquiry into her treatment by the authorities .
" there are questions to be asked at state and federal level about pauline 's investigation , prosecution and incarceration , " said bill flynn , one nation leader in the queensland state parliament .
immigration ms hanson had been found guilty of fraudulently registering her one nation party in the australian state of queensland .
prosecutors said that she had used the names of supporters as genuine members of her party in order to qualify for electoral $ 300,000 in electoral funding .
she and david ettridge each spent 78 nights in jail .
pauline hanson was a former fish-and-chip shop owner who burst onto australia 's political scene in 1996 when she won a seat as an independent in the federal parliament on a platform opposing immigration and what she saw as handouts to aborigines .
a year later she set up one nation , along with david ettridge .
their party won almost 25 % of votes in a state election in 1998 , but after that support began to fade , and ms hanson lost her own seat in a federal vote in the same year .
internal rivalries began to pull one nation apart and ms hanson left the party last year to concentrate on her legal difficulties .
her conviction and jailing in august led to an upswing in sympathy and support .
a bbc correspondent in australia , phil mercer , says her release from jail could now re-ignite her political career .

prosecuting lawyer richard latham qc was expected to spend up to three days presenting his evidence against mr huntley , who denies the charges .
he is also explaining the case against mr huntley 's former girlfriend maxine carr , who denies two charges of assisting an offender and one of conspiring to pervert the course of justice .
the main allegations made by the prosecution on day one were as follows : mr huntley murdered both girls " for some reason known only to him " , shortly after they left holly 's home at 1815 bst on sunday 4 august , 2002 , mr latham claimed it was unlikely the defence would dispute the claim the girls went into mr huntley 's home , that they died soon afterwards and that he took their bodies to the place where they were found , mr latham said the focus for the prosecution will be the argument that the girls died in mr huntley 's home and that this amounted to double murder mr latham said mr huntley was a manipulative individual who had known precisely what he was up to and " was trying to get away with murder " the former school caretaker took the girls ' bodies from soham and tried to hide them in " such a way that they would never be found " , the prosecution claimed mr latham asked the jury to consider two questions about mr huntley : " one - is this a man who is thinking sensibly , a man who is in control of himself ?
two - is this a man who is capable of telling convincing lies ? "
the prosecution does not believe ms carr was directly involved in the murders .
it alleges her role was to support mr huntley in a " wholly dishonest account of his movements and actions " richard latham qc says huntley murdered both girls on saturday 3 august ms carr was in grimsby with mr huntley 's parents , visiting her mother , the prosecution claims .
she had planned to stay a week but came home early , on 6 august , because of events in soham , it said ms carr lied to police over her and mr huntley 's whereabouts on the weekend of the girls ' disappearance , the prosecution claimed .
phone records proved she was in grimsby , but she had only confirmed this after her arrest , mr latham said a " significant find " led to the arrests of mr huntley and ms carr at the home they shared , on 17 august by coincidence three members of the public found the remains of holly and jessica later the same day ms carr had been the girls ' classroom assistant and their teacher thought she was unable to create an appropriate distance she applied for the post when it was advertised on a permanent basis , but was unsuccessful mr huntley and ms carr lived in a house at soham village college , which came with mr huntley 's job as site manager .
the prosecution said it could be significant that the home had been refurbished shortly before they moved in tributes to the girls have been left outside the court on the day they went missing , the girls had been playing together at holly 's house the search for them began at 2030 bst .
the chapmans ' concern was heightened when they called jessica 's phone and found it was switched off the prosecution described what it believed was the route the girls took from holly 's house .
it showed the jury cctv footage of the girls at a sports centre , thought to be at 1827 bst .
it said they were seen by a number of witnesses mr latham said that on the sunday , mr huntley rented a video at 1431 bst .
he was seen again at 1650 bst near the sports centre and next to it at 1815 bst , the prosecution said .
the girls would have passed by within 15 minutes mr latham said that after 1815 bst , mr huntley and his ford fiesta were not seen by anyone until 2235 bst .
his whereabouts during that period are unknown a last phone signal had come from jessica 's mobile at 1846 bst that evening .
