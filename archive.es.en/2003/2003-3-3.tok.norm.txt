' request to station 62,000 troops in turkey , the turkish foreign minister said he expected a second vote on the issue . turkish leaders had a demanding diplomatic problem on their hands monday .
faced with parliamentary rejection of a u.s. request to station a potential invasion force of iraq in the country , the leaders were searching monday for a new way to clear a path for the 62,000 american soldiers .
the search began after the parliament refused in a narrow vote on saturday to endorse the u.s. request .
after the vote , turkish leaders gave conflicting signs about whether the parliament would reconsider its decision .
a top official in turkey 's governing justice and development party , eyup fatsa , said parliament was n't planning to take up the issue in the " foreseeable future . "
but foreign minister yasar yakis indicated on sunday that his government would ask parliament to vote a second time .
after a marathon meeting of senior officials , yakis told the new york times that the resolution would be presented to the parliament this week .
problems arise from rejection the decision creates complications for both sides .
the turks stand to lose a $ 15 billion package of loans and grants , money that could help it fend off its worst recession since 1945 .
in addition , they may have damaged a friendship with a key supporter of the country 's drive to join the european union .
the decision upsets the efforts of u.s. military planners as well .
they have been hoping that they could launch a thrust into iraq from neighboring turkey .
experts say such a thrust launched in conjunction with an attack from the south in kuwait could limit u.s. losses and shorten any war over baghdad 's alleged weapons of mass destruction .
ships bearing armor and supplies for the 4th infantry division have been waiting off turkey 's mediterranean coast for days .
as a result of the vote , they possibly will be diverted south to join an invasion force massing in the persian gulf area .
nato takes up aid question the vote was one of two military issues that turkish officials were considering on monday .
the second matter involves the amount of aid that turkey 's allies in the north atlantic treaty organization are willing to provide to help the turkish military ward off any possible attack from iraq .
after a stiff fight last month , the alliance 's leadership was able to push through a u.s. request that alliance members would provide turkey with reconnaissance aircraft , air-defense missiles and troops who specialize in combating nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
germany has provided 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for the airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft .
german defense minster peter struck said on thursday that germany would not provide any more assistance .

' request to station 62,000 troops in turkey , the turkish foreign minister said he expected a second vote on the issue . turkish leaders had a demanding diplomatic problem on their hands monday .
faced with parliamentary rejection of a u.s. request to station a potential invasion force of iraq in the country , the leaders were searching monday for a new way to clear a path for the 62,000 american soldiers .
the search began after the parliament refused in a narrow vote on saturday to endorse the u.s. request .
after the vote , turkish leaders gave conflicting signs about whether the parliament would reconsider its decision .
a top official in turkey 's governing justice and development party , eyup fatsa , said parliament was n't planning to take up the issue in the " foreseeable future . "
but foreign minister yasar yakis indicated on sunday that his government would ask parliament to vote a second time .
after a marathon meeting of senior officials , yakis told the new york times that the resolution would be presented to the parliament this week .
problems arise from rejection the decision creates complications for both sides .
the turks stand to lose a $ 15 billion package of loans and grants , money that could help it fend off its worst recession since 1945 .
in addition , they may have damaged a friendship with a key supporter of the country 's drive to join the european union .
the decision upsets the efforts of u.s. military planners as well .
they have been hoping that they could launch a thrust into iraq from neighboring turkey .
experts say such a thrust launched in conjunction with an attack from the south in kuwait could limit u.s. losses and shorten any war over baghdad 's alleged weapons of mass destruction .
ships bearing armor and supplies for the 4th infantry division have been waiting off turkey 's mediterranean coast for days .
as a result of the vote , they possibly will be diverted south to join an invasion force massing in the persian gulf area .
nato takes up aid question the vote was one of two military issues that turkish officials were considering on monday .
the second matter involves the amount of aid that turkey 's allies in the north atlantic treaty organization are willing to provide to help the turkish military ward off any possible attack from iraq .
after a stiff fight last month , the alliance 's leadership was able to push through a u.s. request that alliance members would provide turkey with reconnaissance aircraft , air-defense missiles and troops who specialize in combating nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
germany has provided 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for the airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft .
german defense minster peter struck said on thursday that germany would not provide any more assistance .

' request to station 62,000 troops in turkey , the turkish foreign minister said he expected a second vote on the issue . turkish leaders had a demanding diplomatic problem on their hands monday .
faced with parliamentary rejection of a u.s. request to station a potential invasion force of iraq in the country , the leaders were searching monday for a new way to clear a path for the 62,000 american soldiers .
the search began after the parliament refused in a narrow vote on saturday to endorse the u.s. request .
after the vote , turkish leaders gave conflicting signs about whether the parliament would reconsider its decision .
a top official in turkey 's governing justice and development party , eyup fatsa , said parliament was n't planning to take up the issue in the " foreseeable future . "
but foreign minister yasar yakis indicated on sunday that his government would ask parliament to vote a second time .
after a marathon meeting of senior officials , yakis told the new york times that the resolution would be presented to the parliament this week .
problems arise from rejection the decision creates complications for both sides .
the turks stand to lose a $ 15 billion package of loans and grants , money that could help it fend off its worst recession since 1945 .
in addition , they may have damaged a friendship with a key supporter of the country 's drive to join the european union .
the decision upsets the efforts of u.s. military planners as well .
they have been hoping that they could launch a thrust into iraq from neighboring turkey .
experts say such a thrust launched in conjunction with an attack from the south in kuwait could limit u.s. losses and shorten any war over baghdad 's alleged weapons of mass destruction .
ships bearing armor and supplies for the 4th infantry division have been waiting off turkey 's mediterranean coast for days .
as a result of the vote , they possibly will be diverted south to join an invasion force massing in the persian gulf area .
nato takes up aid question the vote was one of two military issues that turkish officials were considering on monday .
the second matter involves the amount of aid that turkey 's allies in the north atlantic treaty organization are willing to provide to help the turkish military ward off any possible attack from iraq .
after a stiff fight last month , the alliance 's leadership was able to push through a u.s. request that alliance members would provide turkey with reconnaissance aircraft , air-defense missiles and troops who specialize in combating nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
germany has provided 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for the airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft .
german defense minster peter struck said on thursday that germany would not provide any more assistance .

' request to station 62,000 troops in turkey , the turkish foreign minister said he expected a second vote on the issue . turkish leaders had a demanding diplomatic problem on their hands monday .
faced with parliamentary rejection of a u.s. request to station a potential invasion force of iraq in the country , the leaders were searching monday for a new way to clear a path for the 62,000 american soldiers .
the search began after the parliament refused in a narrow vote on saturday to endorse the u.s. request .
after the vote , turkish leaders gave conflicting signs about whether the parliament would reconsider its decision .
a top official in turkey 's governing justice and development party , eyup fatsa , said parliament was n't planning to take up the issue in the " foreseeable future . "
but foreign minister yasar yakis indicated on sunday that his government would ask parliament to vote a second time .
after a marathon meeting of senior officials , yakis told the new york times that the resolution would be presented to the parliament this week .
problems arise from rejection the decision creates complications for both sides .
the turks stand to lose a $ 15 billion package of loans and grants , money that could help it fend off its worst recession since 1945 .
in addition , they may have damaged a friendship with a key supporter of the country 's drive to join the european union .
the decision upsets the efforts of u.s. military planners as well .
they have been hoping that they could launch a thrust into iraq from neighboring turkey .
experts say such a thrust launched in conjunction with an attack from the south in kuwait could limit u.s. losses and shorten any war over baghdad 's alleged weapons of mass destruction .
ships bearing armor and supplies for the 4th infantry division have been waiting off turkey 's mediterranean coast for days .
as a result of the vote , they possibly will be diverted south to join an invasion force massing in the persian gulf area .
nato takes up aid question the vote was one of two military issues that turkish officials were considering on monday .
the second matter involves the amount of aid that turkey 's allies in the north atlantic treaty organization are willing to provide to help the turkish military ward off any possible attack from iraq .
after a stiff fight last month , the alliance 's leadership was able to push through a u.s. request that alliance members would provide turkey with reconnaissance aircraft , air-defense missiles and troops who specialize in combating nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
germany has provided 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for the airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft .
german defense minster peter struck said on thursday that germany would not provide any more assistance .

' request to station 62,000 troops in turkey , the turkish foreign minister said he expected a second vote on the issue . turkish leaders had a demanding diplomatic problem on their hands monday .
faced with parliamentary rejection of a u.s. request to station a potential invasion force of iraq in the country , the leaders were searching monday for a new way to clear a path for the 62,000 american soldiers .
the search began after the parliament refused in a narrow vote on saturday to endorse the u.s. request .
after the vote , turkish leaders gave conflicting signs about whether the parliament would reconsider its decision .
a top official in turkey 's governing justice and development party , eyup fatsa , said parliament was n't planning to take up the issue in the " foreseeable future . "
but foreign minister yasar yakis indicated on sunday that his government would ask parliament to vote a second time .
after a marathon meeting of senior officials , yakis told the new york times that the resolution would be presented to the parliament this week .
problems arise from rejection the decision creates complications for both sides .
the turks stand to lose a $ 15 billion package of loans and grants , money that could help it fend off its worst recession since 1945 .
in addition , they may have damaged a friendship with a key supporter of the country 's drive to join the european union .
the decision upsets the efforts of u.s. military planners as well .
they have been hoping that they could launch a thrust into iraq from neighboring turkey .
experts say such a thrust launched in conjunction with an attack from the south in kuwait could limit u.s. losses and shorten any war over baghdad 's alleged weapons of mass destruction .
ships bearing armor and supplies for the 4th infantry division have been waiting off turkey 's mediterranean coast for days .
as a result of the vote , they possibly will be diverted south to join an invasion force massing in the persian gulf area .
nato takes up aid question the vote was one of two military issues that turkish officials were considering on monday .
the second matter involves the amount of aid that turkey 's allies in the north atlantic treaty organization are willing to provide to help the turkish military ward off any possible attack from iraq .
after a stiff fight last month , the alliance 's leadership was able to push through a u.s. request that alliance members would provide turkey with reconnaissance aircraft , air-defense missiles and troops who specialize in combating nuclear , biological and chemical weapons .
germany has provided 46 patriot air-defense missiles and about 30 crew members for the airborne warning and control system -lrb- awacs -rrb- aircraft .
