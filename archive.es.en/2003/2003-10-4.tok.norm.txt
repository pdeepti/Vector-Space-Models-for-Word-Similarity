the conference in italy charged with the task of finishing negotiations for a european constitution convenes saturday .
but with states still far apart on numerous issues , can they finish their work by december ? all paths lead to rome .
that ’ s true for europe , too .
in 1957 , six european countries came together here to create the core of the european economic community .
and now , if italian prime minister silvio berlusconi gets his way , rome will be the city where the first-ever european constitution is completed , a historical document that lays out the foundations for an expanded , 25-member european union .
on saturday , leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states and 10 accession states gathered in rome for the intergovernmental conference that is expected to conclude negotiations on europe ’ s draft constitution .
but it ’ s questionable whether negotiations at the intergovernmental conference can be concluded prior to december ’ s planned eu summit .
the list of desired changes is lengthy . historically charged venue as the venue for the conference , berlusconi has chosen the former world ’ s expo grounds , the palace of congresses , in south rome – a complex constructed by mussolini in the 1930s that is filled with massive marble facades , naked , muscle-bound statues and fountains , the kind of architecture glorified by the fascists .
not all of the leaders attending are comfortable with the historically charged location , but italian authorities have said it ’ s the only place available where increased security measures can be adequately imposed .
only two weeks ago , berlusconi came under fire for remarks in an interview with a british magazine that appeared to depict mussolini in a favorable light .
he ’ s since said he regretted the remarks .
‘ a beginning and an end ’ on saturday , berlusconi once again impressed on his colleagues the urgency of december ’ s deadline .
if negotiations aren ’ t completed by then , he warned , it would be difficult to hold a signing ceremony on may 9 , 2004 , which the constitution designates as a european holiday .
" the constitution represents a beginning and an end , " berlusconi said saturday morning .
" it must mark the end of the divisions of europe caused by the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century ...
it must mark the beginning of a europe with strong common institutions , able to ensure peace , security and prosperity for its citizens , and to conduct a strong , independent economic policy for development . "
tough negotiations expected before the opening of the conference , german chancellor gerhard schröder admonished his eu colleagues not to seek to change the draft constitution , which was negotiated over 16 months at the european convention in brussels .
spain and poland , however , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as laid out in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
austria and a number of smaller eu countries are also demanding that each member state be given a seat on the european commission .
the current draft calls for 15 members of the commission with voting rights , with those seats rotating between the 25 member states .
austria has also questioned the need for a european council president , who would preside in office for 2.5 years and be responsible for coordinating eu summits .
britain , meanwhile , is seeking to limit the competencies of the proposed eu foreign minister to the extent possible .
deeply catholic poland wants to see a reference to " god " in the text – a move that is strongly opposed by finland and hungary .
finishing a decade ’ s work but on saturday , eu leaders expressed the importance of reaching an agreement on the constitution .
" we believe that it is not just another stopgap treaty , " said pat cox , president of the european union .
" we believe it is a bridge to stop permanent tinkering with systems in europe and the possibility to close an endless , decade-long introspection in relation to our institutions . "
the first serious round of negotiations is slated to begin on saturday afternoon , with a meeting of member and accession state foreign ministers .
between now and december , nine additional meetings are planned , and the german delegation is preparing for difficult negotiations .
but chancellor schröder has said he is optimistic a compromise on the divisive issues can be reached and that reason will win out in the end . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de europe 's constitution takes shape read dw-world 's complete coverage of the drafting of europe 's first-ever constitution , with background articles on the sticky issues and what a constitution means for the future of the eu . radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the conference in italy charged with the task of finishing negotiations for a european constitution convenes saturday .
but with states still far apart on numerous issues , can they finish their work by december ? all paths lead to rome .
that ’ s true for europe , too .
in 1957 , six european countries came together here to create the core of the european economic community .
and now , if italian prime minister silvio berlusconi gets his way , rome will be the city where the first-ever european constitution is completed , a historical document that lays out the foundations for an expanded , 25-member european union .
on saturday , leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states and 10 accession states gathered in rome for the intergovernmental conference that is expected to conclude negotiations on europe ’ s draft constitution .
but it ’ s questionable whether negotiations at the intergovernmental conference can be concluded prior to december ’ s planned eu summit .
the list of desired changes is lengthy . historically charged venue as the venue for the conference , berlusconi has chosen the former world ’ s expo grounds , the palace of congresses , in south rome – a complex constructed by mussolini in the 1930s that is filled with massive marble facades , naked , muscle-bound statues and fountains , the kind of architecture glorified by the fascists .
not all of the leaders attending are comfortable with the historically charged location , but italian authorities have said it ’ s the only place available where increased security measures can be adequately imposed .
only two weeks ago , berlusconi came under fire for remarks in an interview with a british magazine that appeared to depict mussolini in a favorable light .
he ’ s since said he regretted the remarks .
‘ a beginning and an end ’ on saturday , berlusconi once again impressed on his colleagues the urgency of december ’ s deadline .
if negotiations aren ’ t completed by then , he warned , it would be difficult to hold a signing ceremony on may 9 , 2004 , which the constitution designates as a european holiday .
" the constitution represents a beginning and an end , " berlusconi said saturday morning .
" it must mark the end of the divisions of europe caused by the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century ...
it must mark the beginning of a europe with strong common institutions , able to ensure peace , security and prosperity for its citizens , and to conduct a strong , independent economic policy for development . "
tough negotiations expected before the opening of the conference , german chancellor gerhard schröder admonished his eu colleagues not to seek to change the draft constitution , which was negotiated over 16 months at the european convention in brussels .
spain and poland , however , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as laid out in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
austria and a number of smaller eu countries are also demanding that each member state be given a seat on the european commission .
the current draft calls for 15 members of the commission with voting rights , with those seats rotating between the 25 member states .
austria has also questioned the need for a european council president , who would preside in office for 2.5 years and be responsible for coordinating eu summits .
britain , meanwhile , is seeking to limit the competencies of the proposed eu foreign minister to the extent possible .
deeply catholic poland wants to see a reference to " god " in the text – a move that is strongly opposed by finland and hungary .
finishing a decade ’ s work but on saturday , eu leaders expressed the importance of reaching an agreement on the constitution .
" we believe that it is not just another stopgap treaty , " said pat cox , president of the european union .
" we believe it is a bridge to stop permanent tinkering with systems in europe and the possibility to close an endless , decade-long introspection in relation to our institutions . "
the first serious round of negotiations is slated to begin on saturday afternoon , with a meeting of member and accession state foreign ministers .
between now and december , nine additional meetings are planned , and the german delegation is preparing for difficult negotiations .

the conference in italy charged with the task of finishing negotiations for a european constitution convenes saturday .
but with states still far apart on numerous issues , can they finish their work by december ? all paths lead to rome .
that ’ s true for europe , too .
in 1957 , six european countries came together here to create the core of the european economic community .
and now , if italian prime minister silvio berlusconi gets his way , rome will be the city where the first-ever european constitution is completed , a historical document that lays out the foundations for an expanded , 25-member european union .
on saturday , leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states and 10 accession states gathered in rome for the intergovernmental conference that is expected to conclude negotiations on europe ’ s draft constitution .
but it ’ s questionable whether negotiations at the intergovernmental conference can be concluded prior to december ’ s planned eu summit .
the list of desired changes is lengthy . historically charged venue as the venue for the conference , berlusconi has chosen the former world ’ s expo grounds , the palace of congresses , in south rome – a complex constructed by mussolini in the 1930s that is filled with massive marble facades , naked , muscle-bound statues and fountains , the kind of architecture glorified by the fascists .
not all of the leaders attending are comfortable with the historically charged location , but italian authorities have said it ’ s the only place available where increased security measures can be adequately imposed .
only two weeks ago , berlusconi came under fire for remarks in an interview with a british magazine that appeared to depict mussolini in a favorable light .
he ’ s since said he regretted the remarks .
‘ a beginning and an end ’ on saturday , berlusconi once again impressed on his colleagues the urgency of december ’ s deadline .
if negotiations aren ’ t completed by then , he warned , it would be difficult to hold a signing ceremony on may 9 , 2004 , which the constitution designates as a european holiday .
" the constitution represents a beginning and an end , " berlusconi said saturday morning .
" it must mark the end of the divisions of europe caused by the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century ...
it must mark the beginning of a europe with strong common institutions , able to ensure peace , security and prosperity for its citizens , and to conduct a strong , independent economic policy for development . "
tough negotiations expected before the opening of the conference , german chancellor gerhard schröder admonished his eu colleagues not to seek to change the draft constitution , which was negotiated over 16 months at the european convention in brussels .
spain and poland , however , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as laid out in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
austria and a number of smaller eu countries are also demanding that each member state be given a seat on the european commission .
the current draft calls for 15 members of the commission with voting rights , with those seats rotating between the 25 member states .
austria has also questioned the need for a european council president , who would preside in office for 2.5 years and be responsible for coordinating eu summits .
britain , meanwhile , is seeking to limit the competencies of the proposed eu foreign minister to the extent possible .
deeply catholic poland wants to see a reference to " god " in the text – a move that is strongly opposed by finland and hungary .
finishing a decade ’ s work but on saturday , eu leaders expressed the importance of reaching an agreement on the constitution .
" we believe that it is not just another stopgap treaty , " said pat cox , president of the european union .
" we believe it is a bridge to stop permanent tinkering with systems in europe and the possibility to close an endless , decade-long introspection in relation to our institutions . "
the first serious round of negotiations is slated to begin on saturday afternoon , with a meeting of member and accession state foreign ministers .
between now and december , nine additional meetings are planned , and the german delegation is preparing for difficult negotiations .

the conference in italy charged with the task of finishing negotiations for a european constitution convenes saturday .
but with states still far apart on numerous issues , can they finish their work by december ? all paths lead to rome .
that ’ s true for europe , too .
in 1957 , six european countries came together here to create the core of the european economic community .
and now , if italian prime minister silvio berlusconi gets his way , rome will be the city where the first-ever european constitution is completed , a historical document that lays out the foundations for an expanded , 25-member european union .
on saturday , leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states and 10 accession states gathered in rome for the intergovernmental conference that is expected to conclude negotiations on europe ’ s draft constitution .
but it ’ s questionable whether negotiations at the intergovernmental conference can be concluded prior to december ’ s planned eu summit .
the list of desired changes is lengthy . historically charged venue as the venue for the conference , berlusconi has chosen the former world ’ s expo grounds , the palace of congresses , in south rome – a complex constructed by mussolini in the 1930s that is filled with massive marble facades , naked , muscle-bound statues and fountains , the kind of architecture glorified by the fascists .
not all of the leaders attending are comfortable with the historically charged location , but italian authorities have said it ’ s the only place available where increased security measures can be adequately imposed .
only two weeks ago , berlusconi came under fire for remarks in an interview with a british magazine that appeared to depict mussolini in a favorable light .
he ’ s since said he regretted the remarks .
‘ a beginning and an end ’ on saturday , berlusconi once again impressed on his colleagues the urgency of december ’ s deadline .
if negotiations aren ’ t completed by then , he warned , it would be difficult to hold a signing ceremony on may 9 , 2004 , which the constitution designates as a european holiday .
" the constitution represents a beginning and an end , " berlusconi said saturday morning .
" it must mark the end of the divisions of europe caused by the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century ...
it must mark the beginning of a europe with strong common institutions , able to ensure peace , security and prosperity for its citizens , and to conduct a strong , independent economic policy for development . "
tough negotiations expected before the opening of the conference , german chancellor gerhard schröder admonished his eu colleagues not to seek to change the draft constitution , which was negotiated over 16 months at the european convention in brussels .
spain and poland , however , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as laid out in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
austria and a number of smaller eu countries are also demanding that each member state be given a seat on the european commission .
the current draft calls for 15 members of the commission with voting rights , with those seats rotating between the 25 member states .
austria has also questioned the need for a european council president , who would preside in office for 2.5 years and be responsible for coordinating eu summits .
britain , meanwhile , is seeking to limit the competencies of the proposed eu foreign minister to the extent possible .

record low water levels on the rhine river are threatening cargo traffic on europe ’ s most heavily trafficked shipping lane . with water levels falling to their lowest levels in over 50 years , the rhine river in germany is becoming increasingly dangerous to ship and passenger traffic .
one week ago , a ship from the popular kd cruise line ran aground near the lorelei , a popular tourist destination in the rhine river valley , injuring dozens .
a number of shipping companies have been forced to suspend their operations on the world ’ s most-heavily trafficked river .
" we ’ ve got the problem under control , " said andreas stolte of the cologne container terminal company -lrb- cts -rrb- , " but it ’ s leading to additional work and costs . "
the situation has gotten so grave that container ships navigating the rhine can only be filled to a third of their normal capacity ; otherwise they risk literally hitting bottom .
for shipping managers like stolte , that means dispatching more container ships or diverting goods to trains and semi-trucks .
and though the company says it isn ’ t losing money yet as a result of the crisis , " margins that are already very small in the world of transport have shrunk markedly lower . "
cts ’ s fleet of ships ply the waters back and forth between cologne to the deep-sea ports of rotterdam , antwerp and zeebrugge , transporting a total of about 300,000 containers a year .
currently , most of the low-water problems are concentrated in germany .
due to its extensive network of inland canals , holland can better maintain water levels for its domestic shipping traffic .
there have still been problems on the wall river , one of the two dutch arms of the rhine .
leaving cargoes at the dock " in the harbors , a good deal of the cargo is being left behind because we can ’ t completely load the ships , " said antoon roos , who heads the association of inland water transport employers .
many shipping and logistics companies in holland are now turning to trucks and freight trains to transport their goods to germany .
roos noted , for example , that german engineering giant thyssen-krupp in the western german city of duisburg , has successfully maintained its supplies of ore from abroad despite the steep decline in rhine ship traffic .
roos said no jobs were currently threatened by the crisis , but it has had other implications .
" the costs for the loaders and shipping agents are increasing , but the inland shipping companies are still okay , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : exposed rhine river floor in düsseldorf .
in germany , industry observers say it is still to early to determine the exact amount of damage the disappearing waters have caused for shippers .
according the the german association of inland water transport , shipping companies at the beginning of the summer were unperturbed by the lower-than-usual waters because they were able to charge supplements for shipping in low-water conditions .
even though that surcharge has now reached 100 percent , it is still not enough for the companies to cover their losses , since they can ’ t carry as much freight .
for companies that travel long distances along the river – which is navigable from basel , switzerland , to rotterdam , the netherlands – the situation has grown economically precarious .
some companies , including the mainz-based frankenbach shipping company have temporarily moored their fleets .
running almost empty in holland , the danser container line said it is still operating ships as far as strasbourg , france , and basel , but the company is only able to fill its ships to 20 percent of their normal capacity .
" there are enormous problems , " said the company ’ s director , ben maelissa .
at the outset of the crisis , the company began renting additional ships from partners and colleagues .
but as river levels fell further , that became an increasingly difficult propositions , since many ships were already too heavy to traverse the low waters – even empty .
but maelissa said that , through a combination of using trains and trucks , his company has been able to continue serving all of its customers .
stretches of rivers closed to ships bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stranded boat in mainz , germany .
the problems haven ’ t been restricted to the rhine .
the weser , elbe and oder rivers have also closed some stretches to shipping traffic .
" that ’ s not unusual on the elbe or oder , " said silke rademacher of the german federal institute of hydrology in koblenz , " there , water levers are always low in summer . "
czech and polish inland shipping companies are currently experiencing similar woes , she pointed out .
after a record dry summer in germany , it ’ s impossible to predict how long the crisis will continue .
rain can lead to an increase in the water level , but only incrementally .
but rademacher said it would likely be weeks before shipping can be fully resumed on germany ’ s major shipping lanes .
and things could get worse before they get better – the rhine river generally reaches its lowest levels at the end of october or in november .
" it ’ s possible water levels will continue to fall , " rademacher warned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de tourist ship runs aground on rhine fifty people aboard a german tourist ship were injured on sunday when the ship ran aground near the legendary loreley cliff , south of koblenz .

‘ a beginning and an end ’ on saturday , berlusconi once again impressed on his colleagues the urgency of december ’ s deadline .
if negotiations aren ’ t completed by then , he warned , it would be difficult to hold a signing ceremony on may 9 , 2004 , which the constitution designates as a european holiday .
" the constitution represents a beginning and an end , " berlusconi said saturday morning .
" it must mark the end of the divisions of europe caused by the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century ...
it must mark the beginning of a europe with strong common institutions , able to ensure peace , security and prosperity for its citizens , and to conduct a strong , independent economic policy for development . "
tough negotiations expected before the opening of the conference , german chancellor gerhard schröder admonished his eu colleagues not to seek to change the draft constitution , which was negotiated over 16 months at the european convention in brussels .
spain and poland , however , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as laid out in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
austria and a number of smaller eu countries are also demanding that each member state be given a seat on the european commission .
the current draft calls for 15 members of the commission with voting rights , with those seats rotating between the 25 member states .
austria has also questioned the need for a european council president , who would preside in office for 2.5 years and be responsible for coordinating eu summits .
britain , meanwhile , is seeking to limit the competencies of the proposed eu foreign minister to the extent possible .
deeply catholic poland wants to see a reference to " god " in the text – a move that is strongly opposed by finland and hungary .
finishing a decade ’ s work but on saturday , eu leaders expressed the importance of reaching an agreement on the constitution .
" we believe that it is not just another stopgap treaty , " said pat cox , president of the european union .
" we believe it is a bridge to stop permanent tinkering with systems in europe and the possibility to close an endless , decade-long introspection in relation to our institutions . "
the first serious round of negotiations is slated to begin on saturday afternoon , with a meeting of member and accession state foreign ministers .
between now and december , nine additional meetings are planned , and the german delegation is preparing for difficult negotiations .

the conference in italy charged with the task of finishing negotiations for a european constitution convenes saturday .
but with states still far apart on numerous issues , can they finish their work by december ? all paths lead to rome .
that ’ s true for europe , too .
in 1957 , six european countries came together here to create the core of the european economic community .
and now , if italian prime minister silvio berlusconi gets his way , rome will be the city where the first-ever european constitution is completed , a historical document that lays out the foundations for an expanded , 25-member european union .
on saturday , leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states and 10 accession states gathered in rome for the intergovernmental conference that is expected to conclude negotiations on europe ’ s draft constitution .
but it ’ s questionable whether negotiations at the intergovernmental conference can be concluded prior to december ’ s planned eu summit .
the list of desired changes is lengthy . historically charged venue as the venue for the conference , berlusconi has chosen the former world ’ s expo grounds , the palace of congresses , in south rome – a complex constructed by mussolini in the 1930s that is filled with massive marble facades , naked , muscle-bound statues and fountains , the kind of architecture glorified by the fascists .
not all of the leaders attending are comfortable with the historically charged location , but italian authorities have said it ’ s the only place available where increased security measures can be adequately imposed .

on saturday , leaders from the eu ’ s current 15 member states and 10 accession states gathered in rome for the intergovernmental conference that is expected to conclude negotiations on europe ’ s draft constitution .
but it ’ s questionable whether negotiations at the intergovernmental conference can be concluded prior to december ’ s planned eu summit .
the list of desired changes is lengthy . historically charged venue as the venue for the conference , berlusconi has chosen the former world ’ s expo grounds , the palace of congresses , in south rome – a complex constructed by mussolini in the 1930s that is filled with massive marble facades , naked , muscle-bound statues and fountains , the kind of architecture glorified by the fascists .
not all of the leaders attending are comfortable with the historically charged location , but italian authorities have said it ’ s the only place available where increased security measures can be adequately imposed .
only two weeks ago , berlusconi came under fire for remarks in an interview with a british magazine that appeared to depict mussolini in a favorable light .
he ’ s since said he regretted the remarks .
‘ a beginning and an end ’ on saturday , berlusconi once again impressed on his colleagues the urgency of december ’ s deadline .
if negotiations aren ’ t completed by then , he warned , it would be difficult to hold a signing ceremony on may 9 , 2004 , which the constitution designates as a european holiday .
" the constitution represents a beginning and an end , " berlusconi said saturday morning .
" it must mark the end of the divisions of europe caused by the totalitarian regimes of the 20th century ...
it must mark the beginning of a europe with strong common institutions , able to ensure peace , security and prosperity for its citizens , and to conduct a strong , independent economic policy for development . "
tough negotiations expected before the opening of the conference , german chancellor gerhard schröder admonished his eu colleagues not to seek to change the draft constitution , which was negotiated over 16 months at the european convention in brussels .
spain and poland , however , are demanding changes to the weighing of votes as laid out in the draft .
the constitution calls for most eu votes to be made up by a double majority – which would require that half of the eu member states making up 60 percent of the population vote in favor of a bill .
madrid and warsaw say this will give larger eu members , like germany and france , an advantage over smaller ones .
austria and a number of smaller eu countries are also demanding that each member state be given a seat on the european commission .
the current draft calls for 15 members of the commission with voting rights , with those seats rotating between the 25 member states .
austria has also questioned the need for a european council president , who would preside in office for 2.5 years and be responsible for coordinating eu summits .
britain , meanwhile , is seeking to limit the competencies of the proposed eu foreign minister to the extent possible .
deeply catholic poland wants to see a reference to " god " in the text – a move that is strongly opposed by finland and hungary .
finishing a decade ’ s work but on saturday , eu leaders expressed the importance of reaching an agreement on the constitution .
" we believe that it is not just another stopgap treaty , " said pat cox , president of the european union .
" we believe it is a bridge to stop permanent tinkering with systems in europe and the possibility to close an endless , decade-long introspection in relation to our institutions . "
the first serious round of negotiations is slated to begin on saturday afternoon , with a meeting of member and accession state foreign ministers .
between now and december , nine additional meetings are planned , and the german delegation is preparing for difficult negotiations .

shares owned by the uk 's 12,000 clubs have risen by an average 6 % this year .
that compared to a 1.5 % fall in the ftse 100 index , and a rise of just 1 % in the ftse all share index , investment education group proshare said .
more than 100,000 private investors are thought to take part in the clubs - often with friends and colleagues .
' risky ' stock the proshare investment clubs / digitallook study also suggests that investment club members have done comparatively well in technology stocks , following the recent crash .
they saw these portfolios rise by an average of 11 % from 1 april to 1 september .
that narrowly beat the 10 % growth in the ftse all share index over the same period .
proshare said : " this suggests that by being involved in an investment club investors gained some valuable experience and were more willing to dip their toe in the market again . "
the independent organisation - which was set up by bodies including the london stock exchange and the treasury - also said the clubs tend to have more balanced portfolios than other investors .
it said : " discussing share ideas with friends and colleagues has helped broaden their investment horizons , ensuring that they do n't put all their money on a risky technology stock . "

one of the proposed additions to the bill is " the right to a sex life and a publicly recognised relationship " .
another refers to " the right to be born and the right to be alive " .
the event , which is being held in birmingham , is being organised by the british council of disabled people .
through its member bodies , the bcodp claims to represent about 400,000 disabled people .
barristers are , and have been , running a coach and horses through disabled people 's rights bcodp director andy rickell among those attending the gathering will be the disability minister , maria eagle , and the chairman of the disability rights commission , bert massie .
the minister will probably be pressed to include measures like the right to independent living and improved access to public transport when the government publishes its promised draft disability bill later this year .
the bcodp 's director , andy rickell , told bbc news online that existing legislation was not working .
" barristers are , and have been , running a coach and horses through disabled people 's rights , " he said .
mr rickell points to transport as being one focus for concern .
" there are as yet no end dates when all trains will be made accessible or when all buses will be made accessible . "
' true voice ' the bcodp describes itself as the true voice of disabled people in the uk .
it says that large charities that claim to speak and act on behalf of disabled people are not disabled-led .
the parliament is composed of individuals from the bcodp 's member associations .
mr rickell stresses that they are not there to represent their own organisations .
" it 's about people representing other people , " he said .
bcodp director andy rickell : " it 's about people representing other people . "
he concedes that there were too few applicants to hold a competitive selection process , but hopes that future parliaments will have contested elections .
" it 's a little bit like the development of any parliament , let 's say westminster .
" the first parliament that happened in the 13th century , i 'm sure was a lot less democratic than the one we have now . "
another parliamentarian and bcodp treasurer , sheila blair , said the ultimate goal was integration into mainstream politics .
" what we want is to give people the confidence and the ability to stand in mainstream elections , where they can represent disabled and non-disabled people . "
for stephen brookes , the gathering is an opportunity to press the media to abandon stereotypical portrayal of disability .
" the representation of disability and impairment in life is not as it should be , " he said .
draft debated a draft disability rights and freedoms bill has already been drawn up so much of the weekend will be spent scrutinising and amending it .
while the parliament might be in its infancy , the rules of engagement might surprise some in the house of commons .
guidelines issued to disabled parliamentarians state : " anyone who makes a personal attack on another person at any time ... will be asked to leave by the chairperson unless they say sorry to the person they have attacked . "

barristers are , and have been , running a coach and horses through disabled people 's rights bcodp director andy rickell among those attending the gathering will be the disability minister , maria eagle , and the chairman of the disability rights commission , bert massie .
the minister will probably be pressed to include measures like the right to independent living and improved access to public transport when the government publishes its promised draft disability bill later this year .
the bcodp 's director , andy rickell , told bbc news online that existing legislation was not working .
" barristers are , and have been , running a coach and horses through disabled people 's rights , " he said .
mr rickell points to transport as being one focus for concern .
" there are as yet no end dates when all trains will be made accessible or when all buses will be made accessible . "
' true voice ' the bcodp describes itself as the true voice of disabled people in the uk .
it says that large charities that claim to speak and act on behalf of disabled people are not disabled-led .
the parliament is composed of individuals from the bcodp 's member associations .
mr rickell stresses that they are not there to represent their own organisations .
" it 's about people representing other people , " he said .
bcodp director andy rickell : " it 's about people representing other people . "
he concedes that there were too few applicants to hold a competitive selection process , but hopes that future parliaments will have contested elections .
" it 's a little bit like the development of any parliament , let 's say westminster .
" the first parliament that happened in the 13th century , i 'm sure was a lot less democratic than the one we have now . "
another parliamentarian and bcodp treasurer , sheila blair , said the ultimate goal was integration into mainstream politics .
" what we want is to give people the confidence and the ability to stand in mainstream elections , where they can represent disabled and non-disabled people . "
for stephen brookes , the gathering is an opportunity to press the media to abandon stereotypical portrayal of disability .
" the representation of disability and impairment in life is not as it should be , " he said .
draft debated a draft disability rights and freedoms bill has already been drawn up so much of the weekend will be spent scrutinising and amending it .
while the parliament might be in its infancy , the rules of engagement might surprise some in the house of commons .
guidelines issued to disabled parliamentarians state : " anyone who makes a personal attack on another person at any time ... will be asked to leave by the chairperson unless they say sorry to the person they have attacked . "
