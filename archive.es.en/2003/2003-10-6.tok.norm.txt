here the mature student and fine art teacher explains why . "
there is a strong link between the word exhibiting and exhibitionist .
a lot of people do stuff for attention but usually end up in hospital because they have some sort of mental disorder .
but being an artist , you are taking part in society 's culture .
i grew up on the infamous north peckham estate in south london .
but i never really had a problem with that estate or council estates in general .
they are really cool places for kids growing up .
i had loads of friends .
i painted for about 10 years before i did a lot menial work . "
i do n't know if there will be more of this sort of performance art on the streets - i 'm not sure i 've inspired people that much " mark mcgowan then i got my degree in fine art .
i turned to performance art because i found it a much more accessible medium to deliver what i was trying to express .
one of the things being brought up in the poorer parts of london is that you get lots of people coming in doing community projects which is a complete load of rubbish , because no-one is interested in them at all .
what they are interested in is football , dj-ing and music .
that 's where they see their role models because the art world is so middle class so there are no role models in art .
the way to engage them in art is to bring it into the street , which is what i 'm doing - not by putting it in the white cube or the national gallery .
' common man ' most people from peckham are not going to go there - there 's no-one walking around the national gallery or the white cube with a string vest on .
most of my work is for the common man .
i rolled through the streets because i was a cleaner and i was protesting about treatment of cleaners .
i pushed a monkey nut to downing street because i wanted to say that people need grants to get an education , especially those from poorer areas .
it took me two weeks and it hurt but going through peckham , camberwell and the walworth road i took it to the people - even though it was ridiculous and must have been a really funny sight .
people ask me when does it stop becoming art and start to become a protest ?
but i say there is no distinction .
it has the possibility of becoming anything and everything but it is always about bringing it back to local people .
i do n't want people to sit in front of the tv complaining about local issues .
i want to say to them that there are other ways of expressing yourself .
it would be really nice to see more activities on the streets .
i do n't know if there will be more of this sort of performance art on the streets - i 'm not sure i 've inspired people that much - but i would like to see more artists on the streets - not in the white cube . "

when is the quiet man going to speak up ?
paul walsh , leeds when i became leader , we had just suffered a heavy election defeat .
duncan smith says the prime minister faces awful problems i am sure that few people would have wanted us to just continue in the same way .
we needed to change , so i ordered the widest-ranging policy review in the history of the conservative party .
we 've produced some good stuff .
we 'll create a patient 's passport to give people real choice in their healthcare , we 'll put 40,000 extra policemen on our streets , and we 'll abolish tuition fees .
i can promise you that you will be hearing a lot of us until the next general election .
do you agree that with all the problems being faced by tony blair you should be much further ahead in the opinion polls ?
mark martin , uk i do n't pay too much attention to polls to be honest - but it is increasingly clear that people are beginning to realise that only the conservatives can provide a fair deal for everyone .
that is why under my leadership , we have made huge gains in elections across the country , and have become the largest party in british local government .
i am deeply disillusioned with standards in public life and government .
can the conservative party restore what has so clearly been lost ?
myles harrison , england i absolutely give my word that the conservatives will restore probity and integrity to the work of government .
from the long list of labour 's many failures , the lack of honesty and truth has been the most disgraceful .
we will make government honest again .
as evidence of our intentions , we have pledged to introduce a civil service bill - which will end the politicisation of the civil service , cut the number of special advisers , and restore honesty and integrity to politics .
is n't it hypocritical to attack the government for the case they made in favour of war when it was a case that you suggested they make ?
danny callaghan , england yes , we said it was right to go to war with iraq .
we still say it was the right thing to do .
if patients choose to be treated in non-nhs hospitals , and so cut the queue for others , we will help them too , because after all they have paid their taxes a brutal dictator , who tortured and impoverished his people , has been removed .
an oppressed people have been liberated .
and a government implacably opposed to our way of life and with links to terrorist groups has been removed .
but what we have said is that labour 's nasty habit of resorting to spin , to lies , and to deceit , undermined the case and undermined public support for what was the right thing to do .
it is for that reason that there must be a full , independent , judicial inquiry .
hutton does not go far enough .
how will you pay for the private healthcare passport scheme without siphoning money out of the nhs ?
sam tudor , uk the patient 's passport is an entitlement to treatment at the hospital that patients and their gps choose - not , as happens at the moment , the one they are told to go to .
let me make it clear that nhs care will remain free at the point of use .
if patients choose to be treated in non-nhs hospitals , and so cut the queue for others , we will help them too , because after all they have paid their taxes .
the conservative party remains absolutely committed to the principle that those who are unable to provide for themselves are helped by those who can .
the idea that somehow the conservatives want to destroy the nhs is nothing more than a labour lie .
why do n't you privatise the whole of the nhs and buy in services for all who require hospital services ?
b patel , britain it 's wrong to think in terms of privatising because what we should be thinking about is the patient and not the system .
the nhs must provide the type of care that patients need .
it does n't matter to us where people are treated - what matters is that they get the treatment they need when they need it .
how will a tory government aim to combat the apparent lawlessness that occurs in the inner cities ?
rod belcher , england it is hard to exaggerate the scale of lawlessness in our inner cities .
conservatism is about opportunity and fairness , and our plans for university will mean that people can go to university based on their ability to learn every day there seems to be a different story on the news of somebody being shot or stabbed .
the victims of crime are often elderly people living on their own , or people living on run down estates .
these people rightly feel that labour has done nothing for them .
we are totally committed to restoring order to our cities , through real neighbourhood policing backed up by 40,000 extra police .
the next conservative government will also give a massive boost to drug rehabilitation schemes to get young people off the hard drugs that cause so much crime in our cities .
why do the conservatives oppose tuition fees when in general they favour the principle of paying for what you get ?
simon stevens , uk conservatism is about opportunity and fairness , and our plans for university will mean that people can go to university based on their ability to learn .
two very conservative beliefs underlie our approach .
first , labour has imposed and increased too many taxes - and their tax on learning is one of the most damaging .
second , we in britain are facing a severe skills crisis .
eight million people lack basic skills .
we have fewer than half as many people qualified to apprentice , skilled craft , and technician levels , as in germany .
more graduates is clearly not the answer to this crisis .
the government 's tax on learning will just be wasted on damaging government initiatives that rig and over-expand university admissions .
what steps are you taking to make the party more representative ?
vineet gupta , england british political parties of course need to become more representative of britain in the 21st century .
that 's why the conservatives are working so hard to boost participation amongst under-represented groups .
i have set up a party community and cohesion executive to interact with minority communities .
euro membership is of course intended to be permanent - which is one of the reasons why it 's such an important decision we have also been working very closely with operation black vote to help us learn how to attract candidates from more diverse backgrounds .
and we have reformed our procedures for selecting candidates .
though there is much still to do , we are making some real progress .
we have more female candidates selected than ever before .
and i hope the appointment of sandip verma as our prospective parliamentary candidate - in enoch powell 's former constituency - will send a positive message about how we are changing .
david willetts has suggested that it would help the country if more babies were produced .
how would your policies make motherhood more appealing ?
deborah clark , england we believe that families should have easier access to childcare .
we want to offer as much support to families through the tax and benefit system .
above all , we want to deliver a fair deal for mothers - who should be free to decide to go to work or stay at home with their children .
i agree that something needs to be done about council tax .
since tony blair was elected in 1997 council tax has gone up by 70 % .
this year alone it went up by 13 % - that 's four times the rate of inflation !
families and people on fixed incomes , especially our old age pensioners , are really being squeezed by labour 's tax rises .
the conservative party is currently reviewing many of our policies and i hope to release our proposals on making council tax fairer before the end of the year .
would you take the uk back out of the euro if another party has taken us in ?
robert steadman , uk euro membership is of course intended to be permanent - which is one of the reasons why it 's such an important decision .
but tony blair 's ambition to take us into the euro before the next election is now a dead duck .
there 's no way he can credibly claim it would be in our economic interests to give up control of economic policy .
the swedish vote makes a mockery of any claim that joining the euro is somehow inevitable ; the british people remain implacably opposed ; and the prime minister seems to have abandoned his plan to tour the country extolling the virtues of the euro .
perhaps that is because he knows that no-one believes a word he says any more .
i intend to win the next general election , i expect to win it , and i 'm planning on the basis of winning it .
so if tony blair ca n't take britain into the euro before then , the question of what happens after he 's done so simply wo n't arise .

do you agree that with all the problems being faced by tony blair you should be much further ahead in the opinion polls ?
mark martin , uk i do n't pay too much attention to polls to be honest - but it is increasingly clear that people are beginning to realise that only the conservatives can provide a fair deal for everyone .
that is why under my leadership , we have made huge gains in elections across the country , and have become the largest party in british local government .
i am deeply disillusioned with standards in public life and government .
can the conservative party restore what has so clearly been lost ?
myles harrison , england i absolutely give my word that the conservatives will restore probity and integrity to the work of government .
from the long list of labour 's many failures , the lack of honesty and truth has been the most disgraceful .
we will make government honest again .
as evidence of our intentions , we have pledged to introduce a civil service bill - which will end the politicisation of the civil service , cut the number of special advisers , and restore honesty and integrity to politics .
is n't it hypocritical to attack the government for the case they made in favour of war when it was a case that you suggested they make ?
danny callaghan , england yes , we said it was right to go to war with iraq .
we still say it was the right thing to do .
if patients choose to be treated in non-nhs hospitals , and so cut the queue for others , we will help them too , because after all they have paid their taxes a brutal dictator , who tortured and impoverished his people , has been removed .
an oppressed people have been liberated .
and a government implacably opposed to our way of life and with links to terrorist groups has been removed .
but what we have said is that labour 's nasty habit of resorting to spin , to lies , and to deceit , undermined the case and undermined public support for what was the right thing to do .
it is for that reason that there must be a full , independent , judicial inquiry .
hutton does not go far enough .
how will you pay for the private healthcare passport scheme without siphoning money out of the nhs ?
sam tudor , uk the patient 's passport is an entitlement to treatment at the hospital that patients and their gps choose - not , as happens at the moment , the one they are told to go to .
let me make it clear that nhs care will remain free at the point of use .
if patients choose to be treated in non-nhs hospitals , and so cut the queue for others , we will help them too , because after all they have paid their taxes .
the conservative party remains absolutely committed to the principle that those who are unable to provide for themselves are helped by those who can .
the idea that somehow the conservatives want to destroy the nhs is nothing more than a labour lie .
why do n't you privatise the whole of the nhs and buy in services for all who require hospital services ?
b patel , britain it 's wrong to think in terms of privatising because what we should be thinking about is the patient and not the system .
the nhs must provide the type of care that patients need .
it does n't matter to us where people are treated - what matters is that they get the treatment they need when they need it .
how will a tory government aim to combat the apparent lawlessness that occurs in the inner cities ?
rod belcher , england it is hard to exaggerate the scale of lawlessness in our inner cities .
conservatism is about opportunity and fairness , and our plans for university will mean that people can go to university based on their ability to learn every day there seems to be a different story on the news of somebody being shot or stabbed .
the victims of crime are often elderly people living on their own , or people living on run down estates .
these people rightly feel that labour has done nothing for them .
we are totally committed to restoring order to our cities , through real neighbourhood policing backed up by 40,000 extra police .
the next conservative government will also give a massive boost to drug rehabilitation schemes to get young people off the hard drugs that cause so much crime in our cities .
why do the conservatives oppose tuition fees when in general they favour the principle of paying for what you get ?
simon stevens , uk conservatism is about opportunity and fairness , and our plans for university will mean that people can go to university based on their ability to learn .
two very conservative beliefs underlie our approach .
first , labour has imposed and increased too many taxes - and their tax on learning is one of the most damaging .
second , we in britain are facing a severe skills crisis .
eight million people lack basic skills .
we have fewer than half as many people qualified to apprentice , skilled craft , and technician levels , as in germany .
more graduates is clearly not the answer to this crisis .
the government 's tax on learning will just be wasted on damaging government initiatives that rig and over-expand university admissions .
what steps are you taking to make the party more representative ?
vineet gupta , england british political parties of course need to become more representative of britain in the 21st century .
that 's why the conservatives are working so hard to boost participation amongst under-represented groups .
i have set up a party community and cohesion executive to interact with minority communities .
euro membership is of course intended to be permanent - which is one of the reasons why it 's such an important decision we have also been working very closely with operation black vote to help us learn how to attract candidates from more diverse backgrounds .
and we have reformed our procedures for selecting candidates .
though there is much still to do , we are making some real progress .
we have more female candidates selected than ever before .
and i hope the appointment of sandip verma as our prospective parliamentary candidate - in enoch powell 's former constituency - will send a positive message about how we are changing .
david willetts has suggested that it would help the country if more babies were produced .
how would your policies make motherhood more appealing ?
deborah clark , england we believe that families should have easier access to childcare .
we want to offer as much support to families through the tax and benefit system .
above all , we want to deliver a fair deal for mothers - who should be free to decide to go to work or stay at home with their children .
i agree that something needs to be done about council tax .
since tony blair was elected in 1997 council tax has gone up by 70 % .
this year alone it went up by 13 % - that 's four times the rate of inflation !
families and people on fixed incomes , especially our old age pensioners , are really being squeezed by labour 's tax rises .
the conservative party is currently reviewing many of our policies and i hope to release our proposals on making council tax fairer before the end of the year .
would you take the uk back out of the euro if another party has taken us in ?
robert steadman , uk euro membership is of course intended to be permanent - which is one of the reasons why it 's such an important decision .
but tony blair 's ambition to take us into the euro before the next election is now a dead duck .
there 's no way he can credibly claim it would be in our economic interests to give up control of economic policy .
the swedish vote makes a mockery of any claim that joining the euro is somehow inevitable ; the british people remain implacably opposed ; and the prime minister seems to have abandoned his plan to tour the country extolling the virtues of the euro .
perhaps that is because he knows that no-one believes a word he says any more .
i intend to win the next general election , i expect to win it , and i 'm planning on the basis of winning it .
so if tony blair ca n't take britain into the euro before then , the question of what happens after he 's done so simply wo n't arise .

how will a tory government aim to combat the apparent lawlessness that occurs in the inner cities ?
rod belcher , england it is hard to exaggerate the scale of lawlessness in our inner cities .
conservatism is about opportunity and fairness , and our plans for university will mean that people can go to university based on their ability to learn every day there seems to be a different story on the news of somebody being shot or stabbed .
the victims of crime are often elderly people living on their own , or people living on run down estates .
these people rightly feel that labour has done nothing for them .
we are totally committed to restoring order to our cities , through real neighbourhood policing backed up by 40,000 extra police .
the next conservative government will also give a massive boost to drug rehabilitation schemes to get young people off the hard drugs that cause so much crime in our cities .
why do the conservatives oppose tuition fees when in general they favour the principle of paying for what you get ?
simon stevens , uk conservatism is about opportunity and fairness , and our plans for university will mean that people can go to university based on their ability to learn .
two very conservative beliefs underlie our approach .
first , labour has imposed and increased too many taxes - and their tax on learning is one of the most damaging .
second , we in britain are facing a severe skills crisis .
eight million people lack basic skills .
we have fewer than half as many people qualified to apprentice , skilled craft , and technician levels , as in germany .
more graduates is clearly not the answer to this crisis .
the government 's tax on learning will just be wasted on damaging government initiatives that rig and over-expand university admissions .
what steps are you taking to make the party more representative ?
vineet gupta , england british political parties of course need to become more representative of britain in the 21st century .
that 's why the conservatives are working so hard to boost participation amongst under-represented groups .
i have set up a party community and cohesion executive to interact with minority communities .
euro membership is of course intended to be permanent - which is one of the reasons why it 's such an important decision we have also been working very closely with operation black vote to help us learn how to attract candidates from more diverse backgrounds .
and we have reformed our procedures for selecting candidates .
though there is much still to do , we are making some real progress .
we have more female candidates selected than ever before .
and i hope the appointment of sandip verma as our prospective parliamentary candidate - in enoch powell 's former constituency - will send a positive message about how we are changing .
david willetts has suggested that it would help the country if more babies were produced .
how would your policies make motherhood more appealing ?
deborah clark , england we believe that families should have easier access to childcare .
we want to offer as much support to families through the tax and benefit system .
above all , we want to deliver a fair deal for mothers - who should be free to decide to go to work or stay at home with their children .
i agree that something needs to be done about council tax .
since tony blair was elected in 1997 council tax has gone up by 70 % .
this year alone it went up by 13 % - that 's four times the rate of inflation !
families and people on fixed incomes , especially our old age pensioners , are really being squeezed by labour 's tax rises .
the conservative party is currently reviewing many of our policies and i hope to release our proposals on making council tax fairer before the end of the year .
would you take the uk back out of the euro if another party has taken us in ?
robert steadman , uk euro membership is of course intended to be permanent - which is one of the reasons why it 's such an important decision .
but tony blair 's ambition to take us into the euro before the next election is now a dead duck .
there 's no way he can credibly claim it would be in our economic interests to give up control of economic policy .
the swedish vote makes a mockery of any claim that joining the euro is somehow inevitable ; the british people remain implacably opposed ; and the prime minister seems to have abandoned his plan to tour the country extolling the virtues of the euro .
perhaps that is because he knows that no-one believes a word he says any more .
i intend to win the next general election , i expect to win it , and i 'm planning on the basis of winning it .
so if tony blair ca n't take britain into the euro before then , the question of what happens after he 's done so simply wo n't arise .

here the mature student and fine art teacher explains why .
there is a strong link between the word exhibiting and exhibitionist .
a lot of people do stuff for attention but usually end up in hospital because they have some sort of mental disorder .
but being an artist , you are taking part in society 's culture .
i grew up on the infamous north peckham estate in south london .
but i never really had a problem with that estate or council estates in general .
they are really cool places for kids growing up .
i had loads of friends .
i painted for about 10 years before i did a lot menial work .
i do n't know if there will be more of this sort of performance art on the streets - i 'm not sure i 've inspired people that much mark mcgowan then i got my degree in fine art .
i turned to performance art because i found it a much more accessible medium to deliver what i was trying to express .
one of the things being brought up in the poorer parts of london is that you get lots of people coming in doing community projects which is a complete load of rubbish , because no-one is interested in them at all .
what they are interested in is football , dj-ing and music .
that 's where they see their role models because the art world is so middle class so there are no role models in art .
the way to engage them in art is to bring it into the street , which is what i 'm doing - not by putting it in the white cube or the national gallery .
' common man ' most people from peckham are not going to go there - there 's no-one walking around the national gallery or the white cube with a string vest on .
most of my work is for the common man .
i rolled through the streets because i was a cleaner and i was protesting about treatment of cleaners .
i pushed a monkey nut to downing street because i wanted to say that people need grants to get an education , especially those from poorer areas .
it took me two weeks and it hurt but going through peckham , camberwell and the walworth road i took it to the people - even though it was ridiculous and must have been a really funny sight .
mr mcgowan rolled a monkey nut in protest against student debt people ask me when does it stop becoming art and start to become a protest ?
but i say there is no distinction .
it has the possibility of becoming anything and everything but it is always about bringing it back to local people .
i do n't want people to sit in front of the tv complaining about local issues .
i want to say to them that there are other ways of expressing yourself .
it would be really nice to see more activities on the streets .
i do n't know if there will be more of this sort of performance art on the streets - i 'm not sure i 've inspired people that much - but i would like to see more artists on the streets - not in the white cube .

' common man ' most people from peckham are not going to go there - there 's no-one walking around the national gallery or the white cube with a string vest on .
most of my work is for the common man .
i rolled through the streets because i was a cleaner and i was protesting about treatment of cleaners .
i pushed a monkey nut to downing street because i wanted to say that people need grants to get an education , especially those from poorer areas .
it took me two weeks and it hurt but going through peckham , camberwell and the walworth road i took it to the people - even though it was ridiculous and must have been a really funny sight .
mr mcgowan rolled a monkey nut in protest against student debt people ask me when does it stop becoming art and start to become a protest ?
but i say there is no distinction .
it has the possibility of becoming anything and everything but it is always about bringing it back to local people .
i do n't want people to sit in front of the tv complaining about local issues .
i want to say to them that there are other ways of expressing yourself .
it would be really nice to see more activities on the streets .

here the mature student and fine art teacher explains why .
there is a strong link between the word exhibiting and exhibitionist .
a lot of people do stuff for attention but usually end up in hospital because they have some sort of mental disorder .
but being an artist , you are taking part in society 's culture .
i grew up on the infamous north peckham estate in south london .
but i never really had a problem with that estate or council estates in general .
they are really cool places for kids growing up .
i had loads of friends .
i painted for about 10 years before i did a lot menial work .
i do n't know if there will be more of this sort of performance art on the streets - i 'm not sure i 've inspired people that much mark mcgowan then i got my degree in fine art .
i turned to performance art because i found it a much more accessible medium to deliver what i was trying to express .
one of the things being brought up in the poorer parts of london is that you get lots of people coming in doing community projects which is a complete load of rubbish , because no-one is interested in them at all .
what they are interested in is football , dj-ing and music .
that 's where they see their role models because the art world is so middle class so there are no role models in art .
the way to engage them in art is to bring it into the street , which is what i 'm doing - not by putting it in the white cube or the national gallery .
' common man ' most people from peckham are not going to go there - there 's no-one walking around the national gallery or the white cube with a string vest on .
most of my work is for the common man .
i rolled through the streets because i was a cleaner and i was protesting about treatment of cleaners .
i pushed a monkey nut to downing street because i wanted to say that people need grants to get an education , especially those from poorer areas .
it took me two weeks and it hurt but going through peckham , camberwell and the walworth road i took it to the people - even though it was ridiculous and must have been a really funny sight .
mr mcgowan rolled a monkey nut in protest against student debt people ask me when does it stop becoming art and start to become a protest ?
but i say there is no distinction .
it has the possibility of becoming anything and everything but it is always about bringing it back to local people .
i do n't want people to sit in front of the tv complaining about local issues .
i want to say to them that there are other ways of expressing yourself .
it would be really nice to see more activities on the streets .
i do n't know if there will be more of this sort of performance art on the streets - i 'm not sure i 've inspired people that much - but i would like to see more artists on the streets - not in the white cube .

a glasgow hospital is home to the uk 's only specialist nurse tasked with helping sick children cope with pain .
susan aitkenhead is a consultant nurse in paediatric pain and management at yorkhill nhs trust .
on monday , along with her hospital colleagues , she will be promoting pain awareness week .
the pain management service at yorkhill has been running since 1994 and has two full-time members of nursing staff , three consultant anaesthetists and input from all members of staff including physiotherapists and psychologists .
it is ms aitkenhead 's job to understand when a baby , toddler or young child with complex physical and mental needs is in pain and requires medication .
she said : " the thought of a child suffering in silence because they can not express how they are feeling is unbearable .
degrees of pain acute pain - short term and usually following surgery or an accident chronic pain - long term as a result of an underlying condition , disease or unknown cause palliative pain - suffering at the end stages of a patient 's life " many children have unseen pain due to a chronic or palliative condition and have to fight to have their symptoms recognised by schools , family and friends .
" at yorkhill , we are dedicated to changing this by constantly improving pain management techniques for children . "
ms aitkenhead said popular myths , such as babies not feeling pain and that that a child is not in pain if he or she is playing , still exist today .
because of that the hospital is this week officially launching a set of " tools " which will allow staff to accurately find out just how comfortable an ill child feels .
the trust has also taken ground-breaking steps to give children over the age of five control over their own pain-relieving medication via a squeezable " orange cartoon man " .
yorkhill hospital is leading the way when it comes to pain management mr aitkenhead said : " the orange man is a very child friendly way of allowing children to have more control over their own pain medication which is carefully calculated by senior staff .
" this is for many children , who may be unable to use the conventional button to administer their medication due to an injury or their underlying condition .
" children with palliative pain require the highest levels of care and symptom control at the end stages of their life .
" this is the most traumatic time for a family , and pain control is usually one of their biggest concerns .
" we work with the whole family during these times , and since yorkhill pain management staff deal with children with acute , chronic and palliative pain , we often have worked with this same family for many months , even years . "

the mansfield-based union of democratic mineworkers had challenged an earlier decision that claimants would miss-out because of the miners strike in the 1980 's .
the payments relate to miners who have suffered from breathing problems like chronic bronchitis and emphysema which were caused by their working conditions .
successful claimants who had left the industry early because of the illness would usually qualify for five years lost earnings .
hundreds affected but the government had previously said miners would not qualify for the period of the strike in the 1980 's .
the udm challenged that decision , saying nottinghamshire pits had remained opened during the strike , so miners should still receive money for that period .
union officials say the government has now agreed that payments will be made .
the decision will mean an extra £ 500 for around 300 miners affected .

consumers , however , got a price cut .
nintendo said it will slash the price of its games consoles in europe and japan in order to boost christmas sales .
nintendo has already cut the price of its gamecube home-use console in the us , taking it just below the psychological barrier of $ 100 to boost flagging sales .
the firm said it now expects to report a loss of 3bn yen -lrb- $ 27m ; £ 16.2m -rrb- for the six months to end-september 2003 .
shock it will be nintendo 's first ever loss for the april to september period .
equally shocking to investors was that , as recently as may , nintendo predicted profits of 15bn yen .
but late on friday , the firm said sales would miss its earlier target by 9 % , coming in at 210bn yen .
nintendo , which faces stiff competition from sony 's playstation 2 and microsoft 's xbox , halted production of the gamecube earlier this year because of a backlog of unsold stock .
its decision to cut the price of the gamecube in europe to a lower one than in the uk won a rebuke from the uk consumers association .
" it seems unfair that the uk always ends up paying more , " a consumers association spokeswoman said .
the gamecube will retail in the uk for about £ 79 -lrb- $ 131 -rrb- , roughly £ 10 more than in continental europe .
no big problem ?
it sector analysts were divided as to the significance of nintendo 's profits warning .
the firm said the problem was largely a technical one caused by falls in the value of assets held in us dollars .
" gamecube is getting beaten by ps2 and xbox , " said analyst takashi okatani at shinko investment trust management co .
" gamecube sales have been slowing since last year .
the forex issue is an additional blow . "
but goldman sachs ' analysts in tokyo took a more positive view , saying " the foreign-exchange loss is non-operational and does not affect our valuation of the company " .

lance bombardier llywelyn evans , 24 , from llandudno , died with 11 other servicemen when their helicopter crashed in the kuwaiti desert .
his father gordon evans says the prime minister should not attend the remembrance service on friday , which will also have the queen , the duke of edinburgh and defence secretary geoff hoon among the congregation .
however , downing street has insisted that mr blair will attend the service , saying the nation would expect him to lead the country in its prayers for those who died and served in the conflict .
mr evans is angry about the uk government 's justification for entering the war , particularly since no weapons of mass destruction have ever been found by inspectors in iraq . "
mr blair should resign and disappear quietly - he definitely should not turn up at the memorial service " gordon evans now he has joined other parents of soldiers who died in the conflict in saying mr blair has no place at the remembrance service .
" i think he got it all wrong from the very beginning , " mr evans told bbc radio wales on monday .
" he 's just a puppet of mr bush and the rest of europe did not want to get involved .
" i think he 's got a cheek to turn up on friday and people are not going to like it .
" he 's the one who sent out troops in the first place .
we would n't be having a memorial service if it was n't for him . "
mr evans said he had initially supported the decision to go to war and his son 's part in it .
" we all thought there was a reason for going to war , but it 's now obviously clear there was n't a reason in the first place . "
having changed his views , mr evans went on : " mr blair should resign and disappear quietly - he definitely should not turn up at the memorial service . "
lance bombardier evans - known as welly to his friends - was one of six young men , including his younger brother lee , from the same street in llandudno , serving in the conflict .
he died just hours into the war , after the american ch-46 sea knight helicopter he was travelling in crashed in the kuwaiti desert .
his family have already undergone the anguish of holding two separate funeral services - in april and then in july - after investigators discovered more of his remains inside the recovered helicopter .

lance bombardier llywelyn evans , 24 , from llandudno , died with 11 other servicemen when their helicopter crashed in the kuwaiti desert .
his father gordon evans says the prime minister should not attend the remembrance service on friday , which will also have the queen , the duke of edinburgh and defence secretary geoff hoon among the congregation .
however , downing street has insisted that mr blair will attend the service , saying the nation would expect him to lead the country in its prayers for those who died and served in the conflict .
mr evans is angry about the uk government 's justification for entering the war , particularly since no weapons of mass destruction have ever been found by inspectors in iraq .
mr blair should resign and disappear quietly - he definitely should not turn up at the memorial service gordon evans now he has joined other parents of soldiers who died in the conflict in saying mr blair has no place at the remembrance service .
" i think he got it all wrong from the very beginning , " mr evans told bbc radio wales on monday .
" he 's just a puppet of mr bush and the rest of europe did not want to get involved .
" i think he 's got a cheek to turn up on friday and people are not going to like it .
" he 's the one who sent out troops in the first place .
we would n't be having a memorial service if it was n't for him . "
mr evans said he had initially supported the decision to go to war and his son 's part in it .
two separate funerals have been held for the lance bombardier " we all thought there was a reason for going to war , but it 's now obviously clear there was n't a reason in the first place . "
having changed his views , mr evans went on : " mr blair should resign and disappear quietly - he definitely should not turn up at the memorial service . "
lance bombardier evans - known as welly to his friends - was one of six young men , including his younger brother lee , from the same street in llandudno , serving in the conflict .
he died just hours into the war , after the american ch-46 sea knight helicopter he was travelling in crashed in the kuwaiti desert .
