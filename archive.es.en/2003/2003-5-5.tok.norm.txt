poland , alongside the united states and britain , is set to help administer postwar iraq .
warsaw ’ s prominent role comes not only from its loyalty to washington , but also from its little known yet longstanding iraqi ties . long a strong supporter of the u.s.-led war against iraq , poland was one of only a handful of nations committing combat troops to washington ’ s effort to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein . now as the united states tries to ensure postwar stability in iraq , poland has been given control of one of three military sectors in the country .
while american soldiers will patrol baghdad and it surroundings and british troops are to manage the south including the city of basra , poland ’ s armed forces will take charge of the kurdish-dominated northern part of the country . whereas france , germany , russia and other nations opposed the war have been left out of any postwar planning , poland at least nine other nations told the united states last week they would contribute troops to a three division-strong force to stabilize iraq . " the idea is to have all the countries , ready to engage , there by the end of this month , " poland 's wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told the reuters news agency on saturday . poland said it would likely send between 4,000 and 10,000 soldiers to iraq , with the final figure depending on how much financial support it gets from washington . the polish forces would then lead one of three , or possibly four , sectors .
ukraine , italy , spain , denmark , bulgaria , the netherlands and albania have all offered troops for the policing effort . not just quid pro quo though the high-profile role allotted poland might appear to some as simple quid pro quo for warsaw ’ s largely unconditional support for the united states before and during the war , washington is also making use of extensive polish ties to iraq that have been built up over decades . for the past 12 years , poland has represented u.s. interests at its embassy in baghdad after america closed its own diplomatic representation down during the 1991 gulf war . warsaw ’ s own ties with iraq have been strong ever since the 1970s .
it was then that around 80,000 poles worked in iraq as engineers , doctors and oil industry technicians .
at the same time much of iraq ’ s elite went to poland to study , meaning that quite a few iraqis speak polish . but those ties mean little to european union politicians who see the poland ’ s relationship with the united states as a hindrance to forging a common eu foreign and defense policy .
french president jacques chirac created a stir this winter when he chastised prospective eu members like poland for signing a letter supporting the hard u.s. line against iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski and u.s. president george bush .
despite that incident , polish president aleksander kwasniewski is only too happy to use poland ’ s new high-profile to serve as a bridge between europe and america . “ we are happy that today we are very close partners with the usa , but we also know the importance of germany and france in the world , ” kwasniewski said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2003 poland takes on lead role in postwar iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland sent 200 soldiers to support the u.s.-led war against iraq .
poland , alongside the united states and britain , is set to help administer postwar iraq .
warsaw ’ s prominent role comes not only from its loyalty to washington , but also from its little known yet longstanding iraqi ties . long a strong supporter of the u.s.-led war against iraq , poland was one of only a handful of nations committing combat troops to washington ’ s effort to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein . now as the united states tries to ensure postwar stability in iraq , poland has been given control of one of three military sectors in the country .
while american soldiers will patrol baghdad and it surroundings and british troops are to manage the south including the city of basra , poland ’ s armed forces will take charge of the kurdish-dominated northern part of the country . whereas france , germany , russia and other nations opposed the war have been left out of any postwar planning , poland at least nine other nations told the united states last week they would contribute troops to a three division-strong force to stabilize iraq . " the idea is to have all the countries , ready to engage , there by the end of this month , " poland 's wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told the reuters news agency on saturday . poland said it would likely send between 4,000 and 10,000 soldiers to iraq , with the final figure depending on how much financial support it gets from washington . the polish forces would then lead one of three , or possibly four , sectors .
ukraine , italy , spain , denmark , bulgaria , the netherlands and albania have all offered troops for the policing effort . not just quid pro quo though the high-profile role allotted poland might appear to some as simple quid pro quo for warsaw ’ s largely unconditional support for the united states before and during the war , washington is also making use of extensive polish ties to iraq that have been built up over decades . for the past 12 years , poland has represented u.s. interests at its embassy in baghdad after america closed its own diplomatic representation down during the 1991 gulf war . warsaw ’ s own ties with iraq have been strong ever since the 1970s .
it was then that around 80,000 poles worked in iraq as engineers , doctors and oil industry technicians .
at the same time much of iraq ’ s elite went to poland to study , meaning that quite a few iraqis speak polish . but those ties mean little to european union politicians who see the poland ’ s relationship with the united states as a hindrance to forging a common eu foreign and defense policy .
french president jacques chirac created a stir this winter when he chastised prospective eu members like poland for signing a letter supporting the hard u.s. line against iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski and u.s. president george bush .

twelve years after the end of the last war in the persian gulf , the united states declared the diplomatic window closed , saying that international attempts to resolve the crisis were a failure .
as a result , the u.s. launched a war against iraq on march 20 , 2003 in a successful bid to disarm saddam hussein 's regime .

berlin ’ s tagesspiegel comments : " if poland and britain want to help make peace in iraq and , like denmark , italy , the netherlands , spain and eastern europe , want to send troops there , then they ’ re doing something that france and germany would only do hesitantly . "
giving iraq stability is in the interest of all europeans , the paper continues , so poland ’ s lead role in this is not grounds to criticize , but rather to celebrate .
but the süddeutsche zeitung in munich warns that poland shouldn ’ t lose sight of the mosaic of american interests .
" it appears that with the division of iraq into sectors , the us wants to deepen the divisions in europe , strengthening poland in order to weaken france and germany , " the paper warns .
de standaard in brussels comments on the fact that european foreign ministers have charged their current chief , javier solana , with the creation of a common foreign policy doctrine .
however , the paper points out , the decision by the us and britain to create controlled zones in iraq reveals that the european union still has its work cut out for it .
and switzerland ’ s basler zeitung says that despite attempts by europe to come to agreement on iraq , superpower america continues to set the course for global foreign policy .
the paper comments : " america acts ... and europe doesn ’ t even react , it thinks about what it would want , if it could have what it wanted , at some point in the future . "
the times of london comments on syria ’ s decision to close the offices of three militant organizations : hamas , islamic jihad and the popular front for the liberation of palestine .
the decision is welcome , says the times , but it didn ’ t come out of any conviction that these organizations are damaging the prospects for peace .
" syria made the decision because it was warned , in the bluntest possible terms , by colin powell that america would no longer tolerate this backing for terrorism , " the paper says .
" the syrians have , for now , understood that the american victory in iraq has changed the entire landscape in the middle east . "
the norwegian paper aftenposten looks at reconciliation attempts by india and pakistan and comments : " it seems that both countries have concluded that confrontation is not productive , and that it ’ s time to break down tensions on both sides .
this realization didn ’ t come on its own - international , and especially u.s. mediation behind the scenes has aided this positive development . "
but the paper warns that both countries are still a long way off from getting to the bottom of their problem - kashmir . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2003 poland takes on lead role in postwar iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland sent 200 soldiers to support the u.s.-led war against iraq .
poland , alongside the united states and britain , is set to help administer postwar iraq .
warsaw ’ s prominent role comes not only from its loyalty to washington , but also from its little known yet longstanding iraqi ties . long a strong supporter of the u.s.-led war against iraq , poland was one of only a handful of nations committing combat troops to washington ’ s effort to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein . now as the united states tries to ensure postwar stability in iraq , poland has been given control of one of three military sectors in the country .
while american soldiers will patrol baghdad and it surroundings and british troops are to manage the south including the city of basra , poland ’ s armed forces will take charge of the kurdish-dominated northern part of the country . whereas france , germany , russia and other nations opposed the war have been left out of any postwar planning , poland at least nine other nations told the united states last week they would contribute troops to a three division-strong force to stabilize iraq . " the idea is to have all the countries , ready to engage , there by the end of this month , " poland 's wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told the reuters news agency on saturday . poland said it would likely send between 4,000 and 10,000 soldiers to iraq , with the final figure depending on how much financial support it gets from washington . the polish forces would then lead one of three , or possibly four , sectors .
ukraine , italy , spain , denmark , bulgaria , the netherlands and albania have all offered troops for the policing effort . not just quid pro quo though the high-profile role allotted poland might appear to some as simple quid pro quo for warsaw ’ s largely unconditional support for the united states before and during the war , washington is also making use of extensive polish ties to iraq that have been built up over decades . for the past 12 years , poland has represented u.s. interests at its embassy in baghdad after america closed its own diplomatic representation down during the 1991 gulf war . warsaw ’ s own ties with iraq have been strong ever since the 1970s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2003 poland takes on lead role in postwar iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland sent 200 soldiers to support the u.s.-led war against iraq .
poland , alongside the united states and britain , is set to help administer postwar iraq .
warsaw ’ s prominent role comes not only from its loyalty to washington , but also from its little known yet longstanding iraqi ties . long a strong supporter of the u.s.-led war against iraq , poland was one of only a handful of nations committing combat troops to washington ’ s effort to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein . now as the united states tries to ensure postwar stability in iraq , poland has been given control of one of three military sectors in the country .
while american soldiers will patrol baghdad and it surroundings and british troops are to manage the south including the city of basra , poland ’ s armed forces will take charge of the kurdish-dominated northern part of the country . whereas france , germany , russia and other nations opposed the war have been left out of any postwar planning , poland at least nine other nations told the united states last week they would contribute troops to a three division-strong force to stabilize iraq . " the idea is to have all the countries , ready to engage , there by the end of this month , " poland 's wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told the reuters news agency on saturday . poland said it would likely send between 4,000 and 10,000 soldiers to iraq , with the final figure depending on how much financial support it gets from washington . the polish forces would then lead one of three , or possibly four , sectors .
ukraine , italy , spain , denmark , bulgaria , the netherlands and albania have all offered troops for the policing effort . not just quid pro quo though the high-profile role allotted poland might appear to some as simple quid pro quo for warsaw ’ s largely unconditional support for the united states before and during the war , washington is also making use of extensive polish ties to iraq that have been built up over decades . for the past 12 years , poland has represented u.s. interests at its embassy in baghdad after america closed its own diplomatic representation down during the 1991 gulf war . warsaw ’ s own ties with iraq have been strong ever since the 1970s .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2003 poland takes on lead role in postwar iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland sent 200 soldiers to support the u.s.-led war against iraq .
poland , alongside the united states and britain , is set to help administer postwar iraq .
warsaw ’ s prominent role comes not only from its loyalty to washington , but also from its little known yet longstanding iraqi ties . long a strong supporter of the u.s.-led war against iraq , poland was one of only a handful of nations committing combat troops to washington ’ s effort to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein . now as the united states tries to ensure postwar stability in iraq , poland has been given control of one of three military sectors in the country .
while american soldiers will patrol baghdad and it surroundings and british troops are to manage the south including the city of basra , poland ’ s armed forces will take charge of the kurdish-dominated northern part of the country . whereas france , germany , russia and other nations opposed the war have been left out of any postwar planning , poland at least nine other nations told the united states last week they would contribute troops to a three division-strong force to stabilize iraq . " the idea is to have all the countries , ready to engage , there by the end of this month , " poland 's wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told the reuters news agency on saturday . poland said it would likely send between 4,000 and 10,000 soldiers to iraq , with the final figure depending on how much financial support it gets from washington . the polish forces would then lead one of three , or possibly four , sectors .
ukraine , italy , spain , denmark , bulgaria , the netherlands and albania have all offered troops for the policing effort . not just quid pro quo though the high-profile role allotted poland might appear to some as simple quid pro quo for warsaw ’ s largely unconditional support for the united states before and during the war , washington is also making use of extensive polish ties to iraq that have been built up over decades . for the past 12 years , poland has represented u.s. interests at its embassy in baghdad after america closed its own diplomatic representation down during the 1991 gulf war . warsaw ’ s own ties with iraq have been strong ever since the 1970s .
it was then that around 80,000 poles worked in iraq as engineers , doctors and oil industry technicians .
at the same time much of iraq ’ s elite went to poland to study , meaning that quite a few iraqis speak polish . but those ties mean little to european union politicians who see the poland ’ s relationship with the united states as a hindrance to forging a common eu foreign and defense policy .
french president jacques chirac created a stir this winter when he chastised prospective eu members like poland for signing a letter supporting the hard u.s. line against iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski and u.s. president george bush .
despite that incident , polish president aleksander kwasniewski is only too happy to use poland ’ s new high-profile to serve as a bridge between europe and america . “ we are happy that today we are very close partners with the usa , but we also know the importance of germany and france in the world , ” kwasniewski said .
“ one can not forge meaningful policies without these states and the usa has to understand that . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carving up iraq plans by the u.s. to divide iraq into three sectors occupied by u.s. , british and polish troops dominate the editorial pages of europe 's key newspapers on monday .

poland , alongside the united states and britain , is set to help administer postwar iraq .
warsaw ’ s prominent role comes not only from its loyalty to washington , but also from its little known yet longstanding iraqi ties . long a strong supporter of the u.s.-led war against iraq , poland was one of only a handful of nations committing combat troops to washington ’ s effort to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein . now as the united states tries to ensure postwar stability in iraq , poland has been given control of one of three military sectors in the country .
while american soldiers will patrol baghdad and it surroundings and british troops are to manage the south including the city of basra , poland ’ s armed forces will take charge of the kurdish-dominated northern part of the country . whereas france , germany , russia and other nations opposed the war have been left out of any postwar planning , poland at least nine other nations told the united states last week they would contribute troops to a three division-strong force to stabilize iraq . " the idea is to have all the countries , ready to engage , there by the end of this month , " poland 's wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told the reuters news agency on saturday . poland said it would likely send between 4,000 and 10,000 soldiers to iraq , with the final figure depending on how much financial support it gets from washington . the polish forces would then lead one of three , or possibly four , sectors .
ukraine , italy , spain , denmark , bulgaria , the netherlands and albania have all offered troops for the policing effort . not just quid pro quo though the high-profile role allotted poland might appear to some as simple quid pro quo for warsaw ’ s largely unconditional support for the united states before and during the war , washington is also making use of extensive polish ties to iraq that have been built up over decades . for the past 12 years , poland has represented u.s. interests at its embassy in baghdad after america closed its own diplomatic representation down during the 1991 gulf war . warsaw ’ s own ties with iraq have been strong ever since the 1970s .
it was then that around 80,000 poles worked in iraq as engineers , doctors and oil industry technicians .
at the same time much of iraq ’ s elite went to poland to study , meaning that quite a few iraqis speak polish . but those ties mean little to european union politicians who see the poland ’ s relationship with the united states as a hindrance to forging a common eu foreign and defense policy .

twelve years after the end of the last war in the persian gulf , the united states declared the diplomatic window closed , saying that international attempts to resolve the crisis were a failure .

twelve years after the end of the last war in the persian gulf , the united states declared the diplomatic window closed , saying that international attempts to resolve the crisis were a failure .
as a result , the u.s. launched a war against iraq on march 20 , 2003 in a successful bid to disarm saddam hussein 's regime .
on may 5 , president bush pronounced the end of major combat operations , as the issue of reconstructing the country and establishing a new iraqi government loomed large on the international agenda .

poland , alongside the united states and britain , is set to help administer postwar iraq .
warsaw ’ s prominent role comes not only from its loyalty to washington , but also from its little known yet longstanding iraqi ties . long a strong supporter of the u.s.-led war against iraq , poland was one of only a handful of nations committing combat troops to washington ’ s effort to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein . now as the united states tries to ensure postwar stability in iraq , poland has been given control of one of three military sectors in the country .
while american soldiers will patrol baghdad and it surroundings and british troops are to manage the south including the city of basra , poland ’ s armed forces will take charge of the kurdish-dominated northern part of the country . whereas france , germany , russia and other nations opposed the war have been left out of any postwar planning , poland at least nine other nations told the united states last week they would contribute troops to a three division-strong force to stabilize iraq . " the idea is to have all the countries , ready to engage , there by the end of this month , " poland 's wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told the reuters news agency on saturday . poland said it would likely send between 4,000 and 10,000 soldiers to iraq , with the final figure depending on how much financial support it gets from washington . the polish forces would then lead one of three , or possibly four , sectors .
ukraine , italy , spain , denmark , bulgaria , the netherlands and albania have all offered troops for the policing effort . not just quid pro quo though the high-profile role allotted poland might appear to some as simple quid pro quo for warsaw ’ s largely unconditional support for the united states before and during the war , washington is also making use of extensive polish ties to iraq that have been built up over decades . for the past 12 years , poland has represented u.s. interests at its embassy in baghdad after america closed its own diplomatic representation down during the 1991 gulf war . warsaw ’ s own ties with iraq have been strong ever since the 1970s .
it was then that around 80,000 poles worked in iraq as engineers , doctors and oil industry technicians .
at the same time much of iraq ’ s elite went to poland to study , meaning that quite a few iraqis speak polish . but those ties mean little to european union politicians who see the poland ’ s relationship with the united states as a hindrance to forging a common eu foreign and defense policy .

poland , alongside the united states and britain , is set to help administer postwar iraq .
warsaw ’ s prominent role comes not only from its loyalty to washington , but also from its little known yet longstanding iraqi ties . long a strong supporter of the u.s.-led war against iraq , poland was one of only a handful of nations committing combat troops to washington ’ s effort to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein . now as the united states tries to ensure postwar stability in iraq , poland has been given control of one of three military sectors in the country .
while american soldiers will patrol baghdad and it surroundings and british troops are to manage the south including the city of basra , poland ’ s armed forces will take charge of the kurdish-dominated northern part of the country . whereas france , germany , russia and other nations opposed the war have been left out of any postwar planning , poland at least nine other nations told the united states last week they would contribute troops to a three division-strong force to stabilize iraq . " the idea is to have all the countries , ready to engage , there by the end of this month , " poland 's wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told the reuters news agency on saturday . poland said it would likely send between 4,000 and 10,000 soldiers to iraq , with the final figure depending on how much financial support it gets from washington . the polish forces would then lead one of three , or possibly four , sectors .
ukraine , italy , spain , denmark , bulgaria , the netherlands and albania have all offered troops for the policing effort . not just quid pro quo though the high-profile role allotted poland might appear to some as simple quid pro quo for warsaw ’ s largely unconditional support for the united states before and during the war , washington is also making use of extensive polish ties to iraq that have been built up over decades . for the past 12 years , poland has represented u.s. interests at its embassy in baghdad after america closed its own diplomatic representation down during the 1991 gulf war . warsaw ’ s own ties with iraq have been strong ever since the 1970s .
it was then that around 80,000 poles worked in iraq as engineers , doctors and oil industry technicians .
at the same time much of iraq ’ s elite went to poland to study , meaning that quite a few iraqis speak polish . but those ties mean little to european union politicians who see the poland ’ s relationship with the united states as a hindrance to forging a common eu foreign and defense policy .
french president jacques chirac created a stir this winter when he chastised prospective eu members like poland for signing a letter supporting the hard u.s. line against iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski and u.s. president george bush .
despite that incident , polish president aleksander kwasniewski is only too happy to use poland ’ s new high-profile to serve as a bridge between europe and america . “ we are happy that today we are very close partners with the usa , but we also know the importance of germany and france in the world , ” kwasniewski said .

poland , alongside the united states and britain , is set to help administer postwar iraq .
warsaw ’ s prominent role comes not only from its loyalty to washington , but also from its little known yet longstanding iraqi ties . long a strong supporter of the u.s.-led war against iraq , poland was one of only a handful of nations committing combat troops to washington ’ s effort to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein . now as the united states tries to ensure postwar stability in iraq , poland has been given control of one of three military sectors in the country .
while american soldiers will patrol baghdad and it surroundings and british troops are to manage the south including the city of basra , poland ’ s armed forces will take charge of the kurdish-dominated northern part of the country . whereas france , germany , russia and other nations opposed the war have been left out of any postwar planning , poland at least nine other nations told the united states last week they would contribute troops to a three division-strong force to stabilize iraq . " the idea is to have all the countries , ready to engage , there by the end of this month , " poland 's wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told the reuters news agency on saturday . poland said it would likely send between 4,000 and 10,000 soldiers to iraq , with the final figure depending on how much financial support it gets from washington . the polish forces would then lead one of three , or possibly four , sectors .
ukraine , italy , spain , denmark , bulgaria , the netherlands and albania have all offered troops for the policing effort . not just quid pro quo though the high-profile role allotted poland might appear to some as simple quid pro quo for warsaw ’ s largely unconditional support for the united states before and during the war , washington is also making use of extensive polish ties to iraq that have been built up over decades . for the past 12 years , poland has represented u.s. interests at its embassy in baghdad after america closed its own diplomatic representation down during the 1991 gulf war . warsaw ’ s own ties with iraq have been strong ever since the 1970s .
it was then that around 80,000 poles worked in iraq as engineers , doctors and oil industry technicians .
at the same time much of iraq ’ s elite went to poland to study , meaning that quite a few iraqis speak polish . but those ties mean little to european union politicians who see the poland ’ s relationship with the united states as a hindrance to forging a common eu foreign and defense policy .
french president jacques chirac created a stir this winter when he chastised prospective eu members like poland for signing a letter supporting the hard u.s. line against iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski and u.s. president george bush .
despite that incident , polish president aleksander kwasniewski is only too happy to use poland ’ s new high-profile to serve as a bridge between europe and america . “ we are happy that today we are very close partners with the usa , but we also know the importance of germany and france in the world , ” kwasniewski said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 05.05.2003 poland takes on lead role in postwar iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland sent 200 soldiers to support the u.s.-led war against iraq .
poland , alongside the united states and britain , is set to help administer postwar iraq .
warsaw ’ s prominent role comes not only from its loyalty to washington , but also from its little known yet longstanding iraqi ties . long a strong supporter of the u.s.-led war against iraq , poland was one of only a handful of nations committing combat troops to washington ’ s effort to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein . now as the united states tries to ensure postwar stability in iraq , poland has been given control of one of three military sectors in the country .
while american soldiers will patrol baghdad and it surroundings and british troops are to manage the south including the city of basra , poland ’ s armed forces will take charge of the kurdish-dominated northern part of the country . whereas france , germany , russia and other nations opposed the war have been left out of any postwar planning , poland at least nine other nations told the united states last week they would contribute troops to a three division-strong force to stabilize iraq . " the idea is to have all the countries , ready to engage , there by the end of this month , " poland 's wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told the reuters news agency on saturday . poland said it would likely send between 4,000 and 10,000 soldiers to iraq , with the final figure depending on how much financial support it gets from washington . the polish forces would then lead one of three , or possibly four , sectors .
ukraine , italy , spain , denmark , bulgaria , the netherlands and albania have all offered troops for the policing effort . not just quid pro quo though the high-profile role allotted poland might appear to some as simple quid pro quo for warsaw ’ s largely unconditional support for the united states before and during the war , washington is also making use of extensive polish ties to iraq that have been built up over decades . for the past 12 years , poland has represented u.s. interests at its embassy in baghdad after america closed its own diplomatic representation down during the 1991 gulf war . warsaw ’ s own ties with iraq have been strong ever since the 1970s .
it was then that around 80,000 poles worked in iraq as engineers , doctors and oil industry technicians .
at the same time much of iraq ’ s elite went to poland to study , meaning that quite a few iraqis speak polish . but those ties mean little to european union politicians who see the poland ’ s relationship with the united states as a hindrance to forging a common eu foreign and defense policy .
french president jacques chirac created a stir this winter when he chastised prospective eu members like poland for signing a letter supporting the hard u.s. line against iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski and u.s. president george bush .
despite that incident , polish president aleksander kwasniewski is only too happy to use poland ’ s new high-profile to serve as a bridge between europe and america . “ we are happy that today we are very close partners with the usa , but we also know the importance of germany and france in the world , ” kwasniewski said .
“ one can not forge meaningful policies without these states and the usa has to understand that . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de carving up iraq plans by the u.s. to divide iraq into three sectors occupied by u.s. , british and polish troops dominate the editorial pages of europe 's key newspapers on monday .

berlin ’ s tagesspiegel comments : " if poland and britain want to help make peace in iraq and , like denmark , italy , the netherlands , spain and eastern europe , want to send troops there , then they ’ re doing something that france and germany would only do hesitantly . "
giving iraq stability is in the interest of all europeans , the paper continues , so poland ’ s lead role in this is not grounds to criticize , but rather to celebrate .
but the süddeutsche zeitung in munich warns that poland shouldn ’ t lose sight of the mosaic of american interests .
" it appears that with the division of iraq into sectors , the us wants to deepen the divisions in europe , strengthening poland in order to weaken france and germany , " the paper warns .
de standaard in brussels comments on the fact that european foreign ministers have charged their current chief , javier solana , with the creation of a common foreign policy doctrine .
however , the paper points out , the decision by the us and britain to create controlled zones in iraq reveals that the european union still has its work cut out for it .
and switzerland ’ s basler zeitung says that despite attempts by europe to come to agreement on iraq , superpower america continues to set the course for global foreign policy .
the paper comments : " america acts ... and europe doesn ’ t even react , it thinks about what it would want , if it could have what it wanted , at some point in the future . "
the times of london comments on syria ’ s decision to close the offices of three militant organizations : hamas , islamic jihad and the popular front for the liberation of palestine .
the decision is welcome , says the times , but it didn ’ t come out of any conviction that these organizations are damaging the prospects for peace .
" syria made the decision because it was warned , in the bluntest possible terms , by colin powell that america would no longer tolerate this backing for terrorism , " the paper says .
" the syrians have , for now , understood that the american victory in iraq has changed the entire landscape in the middle east . "
the norwegian paper aftenposten looks at reconciliation attempts by india and pakistan and comments : " it seems that both countries have concluded that confrontation is not productive , and that it ’ s time to break down tensions on both sides .
this realization didn ’ t come on its own - international , and especially u.s. mediation behind the scenes has aided this positive development . "
but the paper warns that both countries are still a long way off from getting to the bottom of their problem - kashmir . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

poland , alongside the united states and britain , is set to help administer postwar iraq .
warsaw ’ s prominent role comes not only from its loyalty to washington , but also from its little known yet longstanding iraqi ties . long a strong supporter of the u.s.-led war against iraq , poland was one of only a handful of nations committing combat troops to washington ’ s effort to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein . now as the united states tries to ensure postwar stability in iraq , poland has been given control of one of three military sectors in the country .
while american soldiers will patrol baghdad and it surroundings and british troops are to manage the south including the city of basra , poland ’ s armed forces will take charge of the kurdish-dominated northern part of the country . whereas france , germany , russia and other nations opposed the war have been left out of any postwar planning , poland at least nine other nations told the united states last week they would contribute troops to a three division-strong force to stabilize iraq . " the idea is to have all the countries , ready to engage , there by the end of this month , " poland 's wlodzimierz cimoszewicz told the reuters news agency on saturday . poland said it would likely send between 4,000 and 10,000 soldiers to iraq , with the final figure depending on how much financial support it gets from washington . the polish forces would then lead one of three , or possibly four , sectors .
ukraine , italy , spain , denmark , bulgaria , the netherlands and albania have all offered troops for the policing effort . not just quid pro quo though the high-profile role allotted poland might appear to some as simple quid pro quo for warsaw ’ s largely unconditional support for the united states before and during the war , washington is also making use of extensive polish ties to iraq that have been built up over decades . for the past 12 years , poland has represented u.s. interests at its embassy in baghdad after america closed its own diplomatic representation down during the 1991 gulf war . warsaw ’ s own ties with iraq have been strong ever since the 1970s .
it was then that around 80,000 poles worked in iraq as engineers , doctors and oil industry technicians .
at the same time much of iraq ’ s elite went to poland to study , meaning that quite a few iraqis speak polish . but those ties mean little to european union politicians who see the poland ’ s relationship with the united states as a hindrance to forging a common eu foreign and defense policy .
french president jacques chirac created a stir this winter when he chastised prospective eu members like poland for signing a letter supporting the hard u.s. line against iraq . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish president aleksander kwasniewski and u.s. president george bush .

olive met her would-be mate at a reserve at loch garten in abernethy , in the highlands .
hopes were high that romance would blossom , especially after her relationship with a five-year-old male foundered last month .
but rspb scotland has now said it does not hold out much hope that the pair will consummate their relationship .
loch garten site manager richard thaxton said : " male ospreys need to have three basic skills in life .
olive 's time is running out again and it is really hard to watch this soap opera being played out in front of our very eyes richard thaxton , rspb scotland " they need to be able to get fish for the female , mate , and defend their territory .
" unfortunately , this new male only seems to know how to defend the territory .
" this means he is not getting fish , and the mating side seems to be a bit problematic for him . "
mr thaxton described the next 14 days as critical and said the male would have to " get his act together " .
olive needs two fish a day but , in order to lay eggs , her partner has to assume the responsibility for catching food .
" this is quite a worry , " mr thaxton said .
bereft " olive 's time is running out again and it is really hard to watch this soap opera being played out in front of our very eyes . "
on one recent occasion visitors witnessed the young male bring back a fish to olive - only to start eating it for himself .
an rspb spokesman said a young girl shouted , to no avail : " just give her the fish ! "
olive 's long-term mate ollie failed to return to the reserve last year .
she has already seen 18 of her chicks fledge over the last 10 years and has become a popular and well-known annual visitor to the reserve .

since the departure of coxon , early in its genesis , blur 's think tank has been tarred with the suggestion the band are an imploding entity .
would think tank be any good ?
would they in fact finish it , no longer boasting a crucial element ?
the answer is yes .
think tank , recorded partly in morocco with fatboy slim on production duties , sounds utterly confident , sure-footed , and , in some ways , defiant .
a decade ago blur - albarn , coxon , bass player alex james and drummer dave rowntree - were proper , pin-up popstars at the crest of the music-as-fashion britpop movement .
now , hitting their mid-30s , they no longer seem to be connected to the pop world in the same way .
and think tank seems shaped by two of the extra-curricular projects albarn has busied himself with recently .
successful side-projects gorillaz allowed him to make hugely successful pop music without using his personality to sell it -lrb- the band 's public persona were animated characters -rrb- and mali music , a record made with west african musicians in mali , was a world music classic .
in the last three years , then , albarn has simultaneously formed a side-project more successful than his day job , and been able to indulge his more leftfield sensibilities without his bandmates .
some are surprised blur have recorded a new album at all .
fatboy slim produces - but it is not a dance album think tank is no parklife or great escape , and much more in keeping with the eclectic mix of 1997 's blur -lrb- which included beetlebum and song 2 -rrb- .
ambulance starts with minimalist electronic beeps , bass that sounds like it is being played in a cave , and gently insistent drums .
the soothing vocals and gentle saxophone sound little like the blur of old .
it is an odd but engaging opener .
crazy beat , on the other hand , revisits the squalling , aggressive punk that has always occasionally surfaced - it is not dissimilar to bank holiday from parklife .
and it is one of the few moments where guitars are in the equation .
african location some of their best songs seem to have been given almost apologetic titles - good song and sweet song are amongst the best things the band have come up with , the latter built around beautifully tender piano .
the exoticism of its african location wafts in intermittently , but never in a showy or pretentious manner .
and you can not begrudge the band for wanting to try new things .
blur virtually defined britpop with their 1993 album modern life is rubbish , and had to deal with the inevitable backlash of being flagbearers for what became a tired , backwards-looking movement .
with oasis continuing to mine familiar territory , blur are making bold and vital music nearly 15 years after they formed , and having lost a seemingly vital member .
few bands can say that .
think tank is out on monday on parlophone .
