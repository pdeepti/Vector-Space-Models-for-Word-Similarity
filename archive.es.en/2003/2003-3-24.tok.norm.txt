on television , the images of bombings in iraq come daily , but there has been little information about the scope of casualties and injuries among iraqi civilians and soldiers . in the southern iraqi city basra , 50 people were reportedly killed on saturday after being bombed by a u.s. fighter jet , arab broadcaster al-jazeera reported .
the station broadcast images of dead civilians , including a decapitated child , and injured patients being treated in a local hospital .
hospital workers told the station that entire families and even a russian national had been killed in the air strikes .
officially , the iraqi military has reported 77 deaths and 366 injuries in basra .
the bombing attacks in baghdad , meanwhile , injured at least 100 people during the first three days alone , the international committee of the red cross reported .
on saturday , the iraqi government reported at least 200 injuries and deaths in baghdad , and journalists were taken to hospitals to interview alleged civilian victims .
by comparison , britain and the u.s. have so far lost 23 soldiers in the war .
though the united states and britain have said they will take all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties , both sides concede that such deaths are inevitable .
" we must realize that no matter how hard we try to avoid them , there will be civilian casualties , " british prime minister tony blair wrote in a newspaper editorial over the weekend .
" but while the dramatic tv pictures have shown the force of the attacks on baghdad , they have also highlighted just how much effort has gone into safeguarding civilians and ensuring the targets are saddam 's regime and machinery of control and terror . "
journalists among victims the first reports of civilian casualties are already pouring in .
five people were killed in northern iraq on saturday in a suicide car bombing , including an australian journalist who was covering the war as a freelance cameraman for the australian broadcasting corporation .
the death of a russian journalist has also been reported in fighting near the southern city of basra .
british private television broadcaster itn has reported that three members of its television crew are missing .
a fourth member of the crew who was injured but made it back to u.s. and british troops confirmed that the men had been shot just outside basra .
whether or not they survived is unknown , but itn has reported the likely death of veteran reporter terry lloyd , a 50-year-old who worked for the company for 20 years .
mass deaths forecast it 's still too early to tell how many casualties the war will create , but one international organization has published gloomy forecasts .
in november , the nobel prize-winning international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war issued a report with estimates of the short- , mid- and longterm consequences of a war against iraq .
in a war lasting only three months , the study predicted , between 48,700 and 261,000 deaths should be expected .
but the estimates did not include deaths that would result from the side-effects of war .
the organization said that the breakdown of iraq 's infrastructure alone could lead to the deaths of as many as 200,000 through infections and other illnesses .
the united nations has also painted a grim portrait of conditions for iraqis .
in a war scenario , up to three million people could be at risk of famine - among them two million children and five and a million women who are either pregnant or breast-feeding infants .
war will exacerbate an already serious situation : the international aid organization world vision says that a quarter of all iraqi suffer from malnutrition , and the death rate of children under five is more than twice as high today as it was in 1990 .
during the 1991 gulf war , the u.s. estimated that up to 110,000 iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded .
the number of iraqi civilians killed was estimated at between 3,000 and 40,000 .
on the allied side , 343 soldiers were killed , 148 in battle .
but the majority were killed in accidents , by land mines or through friendly fire from allied troops . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

like most people , she would have loved to go , but her daughter was ill .
but unlike most people , link had an invite to the ceremony .
and not only that , her latest film , nowhere in africa won in the best foreign language movie category .
it was the first time since 1979 that germany netted the coveted award .
this morning , journalists calling the 38-year-old german director 's munich home got her answering machine : " now we 've won that piece of gold after all .
we 're all unbelievably happy . "
a love story spanning two continents , nowhere in africa is the extraordinary tale of a jewish family who flees the nazi regime in 1938 for a remote farm in kenya .
abandoning their comfortable life in germany , each member of the family comes to terms with the harsh realities of life in africa in their own way , haunted by the atrocities in nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has won acclaim in particular for its cinematography , which captures breathtaking landscapes of the african bush and local life .
link says that her aim in film is to " tell a story , that does n't only entertain , but also touches the soul . "
the film has now attracted considerable attention abroad , including the u.s. , marking a new era in german film , according to producer peter hermann .
fascinated by film caroline link was born in bad nauheim in 1964 .
her love-affair with film began during an internship at the bavaria film studios .
in the following years , link made various attempts at making films , both as script editor and assistant director .
but it was in the role of director , that link finally saw success : both of her first films - summer days -lrb- sommertage -rrb- , and the children 's film kalle the dreamer -lrb- kalle der träumer -rrb- - received numerous prizes in germany .
in 1996 , link achieved her international breakthrough with beyond silence -lrb- jenseits der stille -rrb- , which was nominated for the foreign language oscar , after receiving numerous other prizes , including the bavarian film award and the german film award .
modesty unchanged despite her shooting star career , link -lrb- photo -rrb- has remained remarkably down to earth : following the news of nowhere in africa 's oscar nomination , the german director said she would " rather stay at home and carry on with her work " than fly to the u.s. for the award ceremony .
" i would probably have some important meetings with important hollywood people , but i really do n't want to be just one in thousands , " she told a news agency .
english translation link also wrote the screenplay for nowhere in africa , which she adapted from the book of the same name by german author , stefanie zweig .
zweig now hopes that the oscar will lead to an english translation of her autobiographical novel which was a huge success in france and has been translated into spanish , hungarian , czech and japanese .
" up till now , we have n't had any success in getting the book translated into english , but now , the american publisher might start to take a bit more notice , " zweig told german news agency , ap .

on television , the images of bombings in iraq come daily , but there has been little information about the scope of casualties and injuries among iraqi civilians and soldiers . in the southern iraqi city basra , 50 people were reportedly killed on saturday after being bombed by a u.s. fighter jet , arab broadcaster al-jazeera reported .
the station broadcast images of dead civilians , including a decapitated child , and injured patients being treated in a local hospital .
hospital workers told the station that entire families and even a russian national had been killed in the air strikes .
officially , the iraqi military has reported 77 deaths and 366 injuries in basra .
the bombing attacks in baghdad , meanwhile , injured at least 100 people during the first three days alone , the international committee of the red cross reported .
on saturday , the iraqi government reported at least 200 injuries and deaths in baghdad , and journalists were taken to hospitals to interview alleged civilian victims .
by comparison , britain and the u.s. have so far lost 23 soldiers in the war .
though the united states and britain have said they will take all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties , both sides concede that such deaths are inevitable .
" we must realize that no matter how hard we try to avoid them , there will be civilian casualties , " british prime minister tony blair wrote in a newspaper editorial over the weekend .
" but while the dramatic tv pictures have shown the force of the attacks on baghdad , they have also highlighted just how much effort has gone into safeguarding civilians and ensuring the targets are saddam 's regime and machinery of control and terror . "
journalists among victims the first reports of civilian casualties are already pouring in .
five people were killed in northern iraq on saturday in a suicide car bombing , including an australian journalist who was covering the war as a freelance cameraman for the australian broadcasting corporation .
the death of a russian journalist has also been reported in fighting near the southern city of basra .
british private television broadcaster itn has reported that three members of its television crew are missing .
a fourth member of the crew who was injured but made it back to u.s. and british troops confirmed that the men had been shot just outside basra .
whether or not they survived is unknown , but itn has reported the likely death of veteran reporter terry lloyd , a 50-year-old who worked for the company for 20 years .
mass deaths forecast it 's still too early to tell how many casualties the war will create , but one international organization has published gloomy forecasts .
in november , the nobel prize-winning international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war issued a report with estimates of the short- , mid- and longterm consequences of a war against iraq .
in a war lasting only three months , the study predicted , between 48,700 and 261,000 deaths should be expected .
but the estimates did not include deaths that would result from the side-effects of war .
the organization said that the breakdown of iraq 's infrastructure alone could lead to the deaths of as many as 200,000 through infections and other illnesses .
the united nations has also painted a grim portrait of conditions for iraqis .
in a war scenario , up to three million people could be at risk of famine - among them two million children and five and a million women who are either pregnant or breast-feeding infants .
war will exacerbate an already serious situation : the international aid organization world vision says that a quarter of all iraqi suffer from malnutrition , and the death rate of children under five is more than twice as high today as it was in 1990 .
during the 1991 gulf war , the u.s. estimated that up to 110,000 iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded .
the number of iraqi civilians killed was estimated at between 3,000 and 40,000 .
on the allied side , 343 soldiers were killed , 148 in battle .
but the majority were killed in accidents , by land mines or through friendly fire from allied troops . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on television , the images of bombings in iraq come daily , but there has been little information about the scope of casualties and injuries among iraqi civilians and soldiers . in the southern iraqi city basra , 50 people were reportedly killed on saturday after being bombed by a u.s. fighter jet , arab broadcaster al-jazeera reported .
the station broadcast images of dead civilians , including a decapitated child , and injured patients being treated in a local hospital .
hospital workers told the station that entire families and even a russian national had been killed in the air strikes .
officially , the iraqi military has reported 77 deaths and 366 injuries in basra .
the bombing attacks in baghdad , meanwhile , injured at least 100 people during the first three days alone , the international committee of the red cross reported .
on saturday , the iraqi government reported at least 200 injuries and deaths in baghdad , and journalists were taken to hospitals to interview alleged civilian victims .
by comparison , britain and the u.s. have so far lost 23 soldiers in the war .
though the united states and britain have said they will take all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties , both sides concede that such deaths are inevitable .
" we must realize that no matter how hard we try to avoid them , there will be civilian casualties , " british prime minister tony blair wrote in a newspaper editorial over the weekend .
" but while the dramatic tv pictures have shown the force of the attacks on baghdad , they have also highlighted just how much effort has gone into safeguarding civilians and ensuring the targets are saddam 's regime and machinery of control and terror . "
journalists among victims the first reports of civilian casualties are already pouring in .
five people were killed in northern iraq on saturday in a suicide car bombing , including an australian journalist who was covering the war as a freelance cameraman for the australian broadcasting corporation .
the death of a russian journalist has also been reported in fighting near the southern city of basra .
british private television broadcaster itn has reported that three members of its television crew are missing .
a fourth member of the crew who was injured but made it back to u.s. and british troops confirmed that the men had been shot just outside basra .
whether or not they survived is unknown , but itn has reported the likely death of veteran reporter terry lloyd , a 50-year-old who worked for the company for 20 years .
mass deaths forecast it 's still too early to tell how many casualties the war will create , but one international organization has published gloomy forecasts .
in november , the nobel prize-winning international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war issued a report with estimates of the short- , mid- and longterm consequences of a war against iraq .
in a war lasting only three months , the study predicted , between 48,700 and 261,000 deaths should be expected .
but the estimates did not include deaths that would result from the side-effects of war .
the organization said that the breakdown of iraq 's infrastructure alone could lead to the deaths of as many as 200,000 through infections and other illnesses .
the united nations has also painted a grim portrait of conditions for iraqis .
in a war scenario , up to three million people could be at risk of famine - among them two million children and five and a million women who are either pregnant or breast-feeding infants .
war will exacerbate an already serious situation : the international aid organization world vision says that a quarter of all iraqi suffer from malnutrition , and the death rate of children under five is more than twice as high today as it was in 1990 .
during the 1991 gulf war , the u.s. estimated that up to 110,000 iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded .
the number of iraqi civilians killed was estimated at between 3,000 and 40,000 .
on the allied side , 343 soldiers were killed , 148 in battle .
but the majority were killed in accidents , by land mines or through friendly fire from allied troops . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

like most people , she would have loved to go , but her daughter was ill .
but unlike most people , link had an invite to the ceremony .
and not only that , her latest film , nowhere in africa won in the best foreign language movie category .
it was the first time since 1979 that germany netted the coveted award .
this morning , journalists calling the 38-year-old german director 's munich home got her answering machine : " now we 've won that piece of gold after all .
we 're all unbelievably happy . "
a love story spanning two continents , nowhere in africa is the extraordinary tale of a jewish family who flees the nazi regime in 1938 for a remote farm in kenya .
abandoning their comfortable life in germany , each member of the family comes to terms with the harsh realities of life in africa in their own way , haunted by the atrocities in nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has won acclaim in particular for its cinematography , which captures breathtaking landscapes of the african bush and local life .
link says that her aim in film is to " tell a story , that does n't only entertain , but also touches the soul . "
the film has now attracted considerable attention abroad , including the u.s. , marking a new era in german film , according to producer peter hermann .
fascinated by film caroline link was born in bad nauheim in 1964 .
her love-affair with film began during an internship at the bavaria film studios .
in the following years , link made various attempts at making films , both as script editor and assistant director .
but it was in the role of director , that link finally saw success : both of her first films - summer days -lrb- sommertage -rrb- , and the children 's film kalle the dreamer -lrb- kalle der träumer -rrb- - received numerous prizes in germany .
in 1996 , link achieved her international breakthrough with beyond silence -lrb- jenseits der stille -rrb- , which was nominated for the foreign language oscar , after receiving numerous other prizes , including the bavarian film award and the german film award .
modesty unchanged despite her shooting star career , link -lrb- photo -rrb- has remained remarkably down to earth : following the news of nowhere in africa 's oscar nomination , the german director said she would " rather stay at home and carry on with her work " than fly to the u.s. for the award ceremony .
" i would probably have some important meetings with important hollywood people , but i really do n't want to be just one in thousands , " she told a news agency .
english translation link also wrote the screenplay for nowhere in africa , which she adapted from the book of the same name by german author , stefanie zweig .
zweig now hopes that the oscar will lead to an english translation of her autobiographical novel which was a huge success in france and has been translated into spanish , hungarian , czech and japanese .
" up till now , we have n't had any success in getting the book translated into english , but now , the american publisher might start to take a bit more notice , " zweig told german news agency , ap .
politics and entertainment despite the war in iraq there was little change to this year 's oscar event .
calls for peace were limited to only two actors , including chris cooper and gael garcia bernal and outfits were slightly more subdued .
there was some protest activity outside the kodak theater in los angeles on sunday .
reuters reported a group of around 50 protesters holding signs saying , " one more american for peace " and " bring u.s. soldiers home " at one main intersection , while at the opposite end of the street , a group of supporters of the u.s.-led attack on iraq waved american flags . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

on television , the images of bombings in iraq come daily , but there has been little information about the scope of casualties and injuries among iraqi civilians and soldiers . in the southern iraqi city basra , 50 people were reportedly killed on saturday after being bombed by a u.s. fighter jet , arab broadcaster al-jazeera reported .
the station broadcast images of dead civilians , including a decapitated child , and injured patients being treated in a local hospital .
hospital workers told the station that entire families and even a russian national had been killed in the air strikes .
officially , the iraqi military has reported 77 deaths and 366 injuries in basra .
the bombing attacks in baghdad , meanwhile , injured at least 100 people during the first three days alone , the international committee of the red cross reported .
on saturday , the iraqi government reported at least 200 injuries and deaths in baghdad , and journalists were taken to hospitals to interview alleged civilian victims .
by comparison , britain and the u.s. have so far lost 23 soldiers in the war .
though the united states and britain have said they will take all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties , both sides concede that such deaths are inevitable .
" we must realize that no matter how hard we try to avoid them , there will be civilian casualties , " british prime minister tony blair wrote in a newspaper editorial over the weekend .
" but while the dramatic tv pictures have shown the force of the attacks on baghdad , they have also highlighted just how much effort has gone into safeguarding civilians and ensuring the targets are saddam 's regime and machinery of control and terror . "
journalists among victims the first reports of civilian casualties are already pouring in .
five people were killed in northern iraq on saturday in a suicide car bombing , including an australian journalist who was covering the war as a freelance cameraman for the australian broadcasting corporation .
the death of a russian journalist has also been reported in fighting near the southern city of basra .
british private television broadcaster itn has reported that three members of its television crew are missing .
a fourth member of the crew who was injured but made it back to u.s. and british troops confirmed that the men had been shot just outside basra .
whether or not they survived is unknown , but itn has reported the likely death of veteran reporter terry lloyd , a 50-year-old who worked for the company for 20 years .
mass deaths forecast it 's still too early to tell how many casualties the war will create , but one international organization has published gloomy forecasts .
in november , the nobel prize-winning international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war issued a report with estimates of the short- , mid- and longterm consequences of a war against iraq .
in a war lasting only three months , the study predicted , between 48,700 and 261,000 deaths should be expected .
but the estimates did not include deaths that would result from the side-effects of war .
the organization said that the breakdown of iraq 's infrastructure alone could lead to the deaths of as many as 200,000 through infections and other illnesses .
the united nations has also painted a grim portrait of conditions for iraqis .
in a war scenario , up to three million people could be at risk of famine - among them two million children and five and a million women who are either pregnant or breast-feeding infants .
war will exacerbate an already serious situation : the international aid organization world vision says that a quarter of all iraqi suffer from malnutrition , and the death rate of children under five is more than twice as high today as it was in 1990 .
during the 1991 gulf war , the u.s. estimated that up to 110,000 iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded .
the number of iraqi civilians killed was estimated at between 3,000 and 40,000 .
on the allied side , 343 soldiers were killed , 148 in battle .

officially , the iraqi military has reported 77 deaths and 366 injuries in basra .
the bombing attacks in baghdad , meanwhile , injured at least 100 people during the first three days alone , the international committee of the red cross reported .
on saturday , the iraqi government reported at least 200 injuries and deaths in baghdad , and journalists were taken to hospitals to interview alleged civilian victims .
by comparison , britain and the u.s. have so far lost 23 soldiers in the war .
though the united states and britain have said they will take all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties , both sides concede that such deaths are inevitable .
" we must realize that no matter how hard we try to avoid them , there will be civilian casualties , " british prime minister tony blair wrote in a newspaper editorial over the weekend .
" but while the dramatic tv pictures have shown the force of the attacks on baghdad , they have also highlighted just how much effort has gone into safeguarding civilians and ensuring the targets are saddam 's regime and machinery of control and terror . "
journalists among victims the first reports of civilian casualties are already pouring in .
five people were killed in northern iraq on saturday in a suicide car bombing , including an australian journalist who was covering the war as a freelance cameraman for the australian broadcasting corporation .
the death of a russian journalist has also been reported in fighting near the southern city of basra .
british private television broadcaster itn has reported that three members of its television crew are missing .
a fourth member of the crew who was injured but made it back to u.s. and british troops confirmed that the men had been shot just outside basra .
whether or not they survived is unknown , but itn has reported the likely death of veteran reporter terry lloyd , a 50-year-old who worked for the company for 20 years .
mass deaths forecast it 's still too early to tell how many casualties the war will create , but one international organization has published gloomy forecasts .
in november , the nobel prize-winning international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war issued a report with estimates of the short- , mid- and longterm consequences of a war against iraq .
in a war lasting only three months , the study predicted , between 48,700 and 261,000 deaths should be expected .
but the estimates did not include deaths that would result from the side-effects of war .
the organization said that the breakdown of iraq 's infrastructure alone could lead to the deaths of as many as 200,000 through infections and other illnesses .
the united nations has also painted a grim portrait of conditions for iraqis .
in a war scenario , up to three million people could be at risk of famine - among them two million children and five and a million women who are either pregnant or breast-feeding infants .
war will exacerbate an already serious situation : the international aid organization world vision says that a quarter of all iraqi suffer from malnutrition , and the death rate of children under five is more than twice as high today as it was in 1990 .
during the 1991 gulf war , the u.s. estimated that up to 110,000 iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded .
the number of iraqi civilians killed was estimated at between 3,000 and 40,000 .
on the allied side , 343 soldiers were killed , 148 in battle .
but the majority were killed in accidents , by land mines or through friendly fire from allied troops . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but unlike most people , link had an invite to the ceremony .
and not only that , her latest film , nowhere in africa won in the best foreign language movie category .
it was the first time since 1979 that germany netted the coveted award .
this morning , journalists calling the 38-year-old german director 's munich home got her answering machine : " now we 've won that piece of gold after all .
we 're all unbelievably happy . "
a love story spanning two continents , nowhere in africa is the extraordinary tale of a jewish family who flees the nazi regime in 1938 for a remote farm in kenya .
abandoning their comfortable life in germany , each member of the family comes to terms with the harsh realities of life in africa in their own way , haunted by the atrocities in nazi germany .

in 1996 , link achieved her international breakthrough with beyond silence -lrb- jenseits der stille -rrb- , which was nominated for the foreign language oscar , after receiving numerous other prizes , including the bavarian film award and the german film award .

english translation link also wrote the screenplay for nowhere in africa , which she adapted from the book of the same name by german author , stefanie zweig .

like most people , she would have loved to go , but her daughter was ill .
but unlike most people , link had an invite to the ceremony .
and not only that , her latest film , nowhere in africa won in the best foreign language movie category .
it was the first time since 1979 that germany netted the coveted award .
this morning , journalists calling the 38-year-old german director 's munich home got her answering machine : " now we 've won that piece of gold after all .
we 're all unbelievably happy . "
a love story spanning two continents , nowhere in africa is the extraordinary tale of a jewish family who flees the nazi regime in 1938 for a remote farm in kenya .
abandoning their comfortable life in germany , each member of the family comes to terms with the harsh realities of life in africa in their own way , haunted by the atrocities in nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has won acclaim in particular for its cinematography , which captures breathtaking landscapes of the african bush and local life .
link says that her aim in film is to " tell a story , that does n't only entertain , but also touches the soul . "
the film has now attracted considerable attention abroad , including the u.s. , marking a new era in german film , according to producer peter hermann .
fascinated by film caroline link was born in bad nauheim in 1964 .
her love-affair with film began during an internship at the bavaria film studios .
in the following years , link made various attempts at making films , both as script editor and assistant director .
but it was in the role of director , that link finally saw success : both of her first films - summer days -lrb- sommertage -rrb- , and the children 's film kalle the dreamer -lrb- kalle der träumer -rrb- - received numerous prizes in germany .
in 1996 , link achieved her international breakthrough with beyond silence -lrb- jenseits der stille -rrb- , which was nominated for the foreign language oscar , after receiving numerous other prizes , including the bavarian film award and the german film award .
modesty unchanged despite her shooting star career , link -lrb- photo -rrb- has remained remarkably down to earth : following the news of nowhere in africa 's oscar nomination , the german director said she would " rather stay at home and carry on with her work " than fly to the u.s. for the award ceremony .
" i would probably have some important meetings with important hollywood people , but i really do n't want to be just one in thousands , " she told a news agency .
english translation link also wrote the screenplay for nowhere in africa , which she adapted from the book of the same name by german author , stefanie zweig .
zweig now hopes that the oscar will lead to an english translation of her autobiographical novel which was a huge success in france and has been translated into spanish , hungarian , czech and japanese .
" up till now , we have n't had any success in getting the book translated into english , but now , the american publisher might start to take a bit more notice , " zweig told german news agency , ap .
politics and entertainment despite the war in iraq there was little change to this year 's oscar event .
calls for peace were limited to only two actors , including chris cooper and gael garcia bernal and outfits were slightly more subdued .
there was some protest activity outside the kodak theater in los angeles on sunday .
reuters reported a group of around 50 protesters holding signs saying , " one more american for peace " and " bring u.s. soldiers home " at one main intersection , while at the opposite end of the street , a group of supporters of the u.s.-led attack on iraq waved american flags . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

on television , the images of bombings in iraq come daily , but there has been little information about the scope of casualties and injuries among iraqi civilians and soldiers . in the southern iraqi city basra , 50 people were reportedly killed on saturday after being bombed by a u.s. fighter jet , arab broadcaster al-jazeera reported .
the station broadcast images of dead civilians , including a decapitated child , and injured patients being treated in a local hospital .
hospital workers told the station that entire families and even a russian national had been killed in the air strikes .
officially , the iraqi military has reported 77 deaths and 366 injuries in basra .
the bombing attacks in baghdad , meanwhile , injured at least 100 people during the first three days alone , the international committee of the red cross reported .
on saturday , the iraqi government reported at least 200 injuries and deaths in baghdad , and journalists were taken to hospitals to interview alleged civilian victims .
by comparison , britain and the u.s. have so far lost 23 soldiers in the war .
though the united states and britain have said they will take all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties , both sides concede that such deaths are inevitable .
" we must realize that no matter how hard we try to avoid them , there will be civilian casualties , " british prime minister tony blair wrote in a newspaper editorial over the weekend .
" but while the dramatic tv pictures have shown the force of the attacks on baghdad , they have also highlighted just how much effort has gone into safeguarding civilians and ensuring the targets are saddam 's regime and machinery of control and terror . "
journalists among victims the first reports of civilian casualties are already pouring in .
five people were killed in northern iraq on saturday in a suicide car bombing , including an australian journalist who was covering the war as a freelance cameraman for the australian broadcasting corporation .
the death of a russian journalist has also been reported in fighting near the southern city of basra .
british private television broadcaster itn has reported that three members of its television crew are missing .
a fourth member of the crew who was injured but made it back to u.s. and british troops confirmed that the men had been shot just outside basra .
whether or not they survived is unknown , but itn has reported the likely death of veteran reporter terry lloyd , a 50-year-old who worked for the company for 20 years .
mass deaths forecast it 's still too early to tell how many casualties the war will create , but one international organization has published gloomy forecasts .
in november , the nobel prize-winning international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war issued a report with estimates of the short- , mid- and longterm consequences of a war against iraq .
in a war lasting only three months , the study predicted , between 48,700 and 261,000 deaths should be expected .
but the estimates did not include deaths that would result from the side-effects of war .
the organization said that the breakdown of iraq 's infrastructure alone could lead to the deaths of as many as 200,000 through infections and other illnesses .
the united nations has also painted a grim portrait of conditions for iraqis .
in a war scenario , up to three million people could be at risk of famine - among them two million children and five and a million women who are either pregnant or breast-feeding infants .
war will exacerbate an already serious situation : the international aid organization world vision says that a quarter of all iraqi suffer from malnutrition , and the death rate of children under five is more than twice as high today as it was in 1990 .
during the 1991 gulf war , the u.s. estimated that up to 110,000 iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded .
the number of iraqi civilians killed was estimated at between 3,000 and 40,000 .
on the allied side , 343 soldiers were killed , 148 in battle .
but the majority were killed in accidents , by land mines or through friendly fire from allied troops . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the death of a russian journalist has also been reported in fighting near the southern city of basra .
british private television broadcaster itn has reported that three members of its television crew are missing .
a fourth member of the crew who was injured but made it back to u.s. and british troops confirmed that the men had been shot just outside basra .
whether or not they survived is unknown , but itn has reported the likely death of veteran reporter terry lloyd , a 50-year-old who worked for the company for 20 years .
mass deaths forecast it 's still too early to tell how many casualties the war will create , but one international organization has published gloomy forecasts .
in november , the nobel prize-winning international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war issued a report with estimates of the short- , mid- and longterm consequences of a war against iraq .
in a war lasting only three months , the study predicted , between 48,700 and 261,000 deaths should be expected .
but the estimates did not include deaths that would result from the side-effects of war .
the organization said that the breakdown of iraq 's infrastructure alone could lead to the deaths of as many as 200,000 through infections and other illnesses .
the united nations has also painted a grim portrait of conditions for iraqis .
in a war scenario , up to three million people could be at risk of famine - among them two million children and five and a million women who are either pregnant or breast-feeding infants .
war will exacerbate an already serious situation : the international aid organization world vision says that a quarter of all iraqi suffer from malnutrition , and the death rate of children under five is more than twice as high today as it was in 1990 .
during the 1991 gulf war , the u.s. estimated that up to 110,000 iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded .
the number of iraqi civilians killed was estimated at between 3,000 and 40,000 .
on the allied side , 343 soldiers were killed , 148 in battle .

like most people , she would have loved to go , but her daughter was ill .
but unlike most people , link had an invite to the ceremony .
and not only that , her latest film , nowhere in africa won in the best foreign language movie category .
it was the first time since 1979 that germany netted the coveted award .
this morning , journalists calling the 38-year-old german director 's munich home got her answering machine : " now we 've won that piece of gold after all .
we 're all unbelievably happy . "
a love story spanning two continents , nowhere in africa is the extraordinary tale of a jewish family who flees the nazi regime in 1938 for a remote farm in kenya .
abandoning their comfortable life in germany , each member of the family comes to terms with the harsh realities of life in africa in their own way , haunted by the atrocities in nazi germany .

link says that her aim in film is to " tell a story , that does n't only entertain , but also touches the soul . "
the film has now attracted considerable attention abroad , including the u.s. , marking a new era in german film , according to producer peter hermann .

her love-affair with film began during an internship at the bavaria film studios .
in the following years , link made various attempts at making films , both as script editor and assistant director .
but it was in the role of director , that link finally saw success : both of her first films - summer days -lrb- sommertage -rrb- , and the children 's film kalle the dreamer -lrb- kalle der träumer -rrb- - received numerous prizes in germany .
in 1996 , link achieved her international breakthrough with beyond silence -lrb- jenseits der stille -rrb- , which was nominated for the foreign language oscar , after receiving numerous other prizes , including the bavarian film award and the german film award .
modesty unchanged despite her shooting star career , link -lrb- photo -rrb- has remained remarkably down to earth : following the news of nowhere in africa 's oscar nomination , the german director said she would " rather stay at home and carry on with her work " than fly to the u.s. for the award ceremony .
" i would probably have some important meetings with important hollywood people , but i really do n't want to be just one in thousands , " she told a news agency .
english translation link also wrote the screenplay for nowhere in africa , which she adapted from the book of the same name by german author , stefanie zweig .
zweig now hopes that the oscar will lead to an english translation of her autobiographical novel which was a huge success in france and has been translated into spanish , hungarian , czech and japanese .
" up till now , we have n't had any success in getting the book translated into english , but now , the american publisher might start to take a bit more notice , " zweig told german news agency , ap .

mass deaths forecast it 's still too early to tell how many casualties the war will create , but one international organization has published gloomy forecasts .
in november , the nobel prize-winning international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war issued a report with estimates of the short- , mid- and longterm consequences of a war against iraq .
in a war lasting only three months , the study predicted , between 48,700 and 261,000 deaths should be expected .
but the estimates did not include deaths that would result from the side-effects of war .
the organization said that the breakdown of iraq 's infrastructure alone could lead to the deaths of as many as 200,000 through infections and other illnesses .
the united nations has also painted a grim portrait of conditions for iraqis .
in a war scenario , up to three million people could be at risk of famine - among them two million children and five and a million women who are either pregnant or breast-feeding infants .
war will exacerbate an already serious situation : the international aid organization world vision says that a quarter of all iraqi suffer from malnutrition , and the death rate of children under five is more than twice as high today as it was in 1990 .
during the 1991 gulf war , the u.s. estimated that up to 110,000 iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded .
the number of iraqi civilians killed was estimated at between 3,000 and 40,000 .
on the allied side , 343 soldiers were killed , 148 in battle .
but the majority were killed in accidents , by land mines or through friendly fire from allied troops . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

on television , the images of bombings in iraq come daily , but there has been little information about the scope of casualties and injuries among iraqi civilians and soldiers . in the southern iraqi city basra , 50 people were reportedly killed on saturday after being bombed by a u.s. fighter jet , arab broadcaster al-jazeera reported .
the station broadcast images of dead civilians , including a decapitated child , and injured patients being treated in a local hospital .
hospital workers told the station that entire families and even a russian national had been killed in the air strikes .
officially , the iraqi military has reported 77 deaths and 366 injuries in basra .
the bombing attacks in baghdad , meanwhile , injured at least 100 people during the first three days alone , the international committee of the red cross reported .
on saturday , the iraqi government reported at least 200 injuries and deaths in baghdad , and journalists were taken to hospitals to interview alleged civilian victims .
by comparison , britain and the u.s. have so far lost 23 soldiers in the war .
though the united states and britain have said they will take all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties , both sides concede that such deaths are inevitable .
" we must realize that no matter how hard we try to avoid them , there will be civilian casualties , " british prime minister tony blair wrote in a newspaper editorial over the weekend .
" but while the dramatic tv pictures have shown the force of the attacks on baghdad , they have also highlighted just how much effort has gone into safeguarding civilians and ensuring the targets are saddam 's regime and machinery of control and terror . "
journalists among victims the first reports of civilian casualties are already pouring in .
five people were killed in northern iraq on saturday in a suicide car bombing , including an australian journalist who was covering the war as a freelance cameraman for the australian broadcasting corporation .
the death of a russian journalist has also been reported in fighting near the southern city of basra .
british private television broadcaster itn has reported that three members of its television crew are missing .
a fourth member of the crew who was injured but made it back to u.s. and british troops confirmed that the men had been shot just outside basra .
whether or not they survived is unknown , but itn has reported the likely death of veteran reporter terry lloyd , a 50-year-old who worked for the company for 20 years .
mass deaths forecast it 's still too early to tell how many casualties the war will create , but one international organization has published gloomy forecasts .
in november , the nobel prize-winning international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war issued a report with estimates of the short- , mid- and longterm consequences of a war against iraq .
in a war lasting only three months , the study predicted , between 48,700 and 261,000 deaths should be expected .
but the estimates did not include deaths that would result from the side-effects of war .
the organization said that the breakdown of iraq 's infrastructure alone could lead to the deaths of as many as 200,000 through infections and other illnesses .

on television , the images of bombings in iraq come daily , but there has been little information about the scope of casualties and injuries among iraqi civilians and soldiers . in the southern iraqi city basra , 50 people were reportedly killed on saturday after being bombed by a u.s. fighter jet , arab broadcaster al-jazeera reported .
the station broadcast images of dead civilians , including a decapitated child , and injured patients being treated in a local hospital .
hospital workers told the station that entire families and even a russian national had been killed in the air strikes .
officially , the iraqi military has reported 77 deaths and 366 injuries in basra .
the bombing attacks in baghdad , meanwhile , injured at least 100 people during the first three days alone , the international committee of the red cross reported .
on saturday , the iraqi government reported at least 200 injuries and deaths in baghdad , and journalists were taken to hospitals to interview alleged civilian victims .
by comparison , britain and the u.s. have so far lost 23 soldiers in the war .
though the united states and britain have said they will take all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties , both sides concede that such deaths are inevitable .
" we must realize that no matter how hard we try to avoid them , there will be civilian casualties , " british prime minister tony blair wrote in a newspaper editorial over the weekend .
" but while the dramatic tv pictures have shown the force of the attacks on baghdad , they have also highlighted just how much effort has gone into safeguarding civilians and ensuring the targets are saddam 's regime and machinery of control and terror . "
journalists among victims the first reports of civilian casualties are already pouring in .
five people were killed in northern iraq on saturday in a suicide car bombing , including an australian journalist who was covering the war as a freelance cameraman for the australian broadcasting corporation .
the death of a russian journalist has also been reported in fighting near the southern city of basra .
british private television broadcaster itn has reported that three members of its television crew are missing .
a fourth member of the crew who was injured but made it back to u.s. and british troops confirmed that the men had been shot just outside basra .
whether or not they survived is unknown , but itn has reported the likely death of veteran reporter terry lloyd , a 50-year-old who worked for the company for 20 years .
mass deaths forecast it 's still too early to tell how many casualties the war will create , but one international organization has published gloomy forecasts .
in november , the nobel prize-winning international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war issued a report with estimates of the short- , mid- and longterm consequences of a war against iraq .
in a war lasting only three months , the study predicted , between 48,700 and 261,000 deaths should be expected .
but the estimates did not include deaths that would result from the side-effects of war .
the organization said that the breakdown of iraq 's infrastructure alone could lead to the deaths of as many as 200,000 through infections and other illnesses .
the united nations has also painted a grim portrait of conditions for iraqis .
in a war scenario , up to three million people could be at risk of famine - among them two million children and five and a million women who are either pregnant or breast-feeding infants .

on television , the images of bombings in iraq come daily , but there has been little information about the scope of casualties and injuries among iraqi civilians and soldiers . in the southern iraqi city basra , 50 people were reportedly killed on saturday after being bombed by a u.s. fighter jet , arab broadcaster al-jazeera reported .
the station broadcast images of dead civilians , including a decapitated child , and injured patients being treated in a local hospital .
hospital workers told the station that entire families and even a russian national had been killed in the air strikes .
officially , the iraqi military has reported 77 deaths and 366 injuries in basra .
the bombing attacks in baghdad , meanwhile , injured at least 100 people during the first three days alone , the international committee of the red cross reported .
on saturday , the iraqi government reported at least 200 injuries and deaths in baghdad , and journalists were taken to hospitals to interview alleged civilian victims .
by comparison , britain and the u.s. have so far lost 23 soldiers in the war .
though the united states and britain have said they will take all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties , both sides concede that such deaths are inevitable .
" we must realize that no matter how hard we try to avoid them , there will be civilian casualties , " british prime minister tony blair wrote in a newspaper editorial over the weekend .
" but while the dramatic tv pictures have shown the force of the attacks on baghdad , they have also highlighted just how much effort has gone into safeguarding civilians and ensuring the targets are saddam 's regime and machinery of control and terror . "
journalists among victims the first reports of civilian casualties are already pouring in .
five people were killed in northern iraq on saturday in a suicide car bombing , including an australian journalist who was covering the war as a freelance cameraman for the australian broadcasting corporation .
the death of a russian journalist has also been reported in fighting near the southern city of basra .
british private television broadcaster itn has reported that three members of its television crew are missing .
a fourth member of the crew who was injured but made it back to u.s. and british troops confirmed that the men had been shot just outside basra .
whether or not they survived is unknown , but itn has reported the likely death of veteran reporter terry lloyd , a 50-year-old who worked for the company for 20 years .
mass deaths forecast it 's still too early to tell how many casualties the war will create , but one international organization has published gloomy forecasts .
in november , the nobel prize-winning international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war issued a report with estimates of the short- , mid- and longterm consequences of a war against iraq .
in a war lasting only three months , the study predicted , between 48,700 and 261,000 deaths should be expected .
but the estimates did not include deaths that would result from the side-effects of war .
the organization said that the breakdown of iraq 's infrastructure alone could lead to the deaths of as many as 200,000 through infections and other illnesses .
the united nations has also painted a grim portrait of conditions for iraqis .
in a war scenario , up to three million people could be at risk of famine - among them two million children and five and a million women who are either pregnant or breast-feeding infants .
war will exacerbate an already serious situation : the international aid organization world vision says that a quarter of all iraqi suffer from malnutrition , and the death rate of children under five is more than twice as high today as it was in 1990 .
during the 1991 gulf war , the u.s. estimated that up to 110,000 iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded .
the number of iraqi civilians killed was estimated at between 3,000 and 40,000 .
on the allied side , 343 soldiers were killed , 148 in battle .
but the majority were killed in accidents , by land mines or through friendly fire from allied troops . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

like most people , she would have loved to go , but her daughter was ill .
but unlike most people , link had an invite to the ceremony .
and not only that , her latest film , nowhere in africa won in the best foreign language movie category .
it was the first time since 1979 that germany netted the coveted award .
this morning , journalists calling the 38-year-old german director 's munich home got her answering machine : " now we 've won that piece of gold after all .
we 're all unbelievably happy . "
a love story spanning two continents , nowhere in africa is the extraordinary tale of a jewish family who flees the nazi regime in 1938 for a remote farm in kenya .
abandoning their comfortable life in germany , each member of the family comes to terms with the harsh realities of life in africa in their own way , haunted by the atrocities in nazi germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the film has won acclaim in particular for its cinematography , which captures breathtaking landscapes of the african bush and local life .
link says that her aim in film is to " tell a story , that does n't only entertain , but also touches the soul . "
the film has now attracted considerable attention abroad , including the u.s. , marking a new era in german film , according to producer peter hermann .
fascinated by film caroline link was born in bad nauheim in 1964 .
her love-affair with film began during an internship at the bavaria film studios .
in the following years , link made various attempts at making films , both as script editor and assistant director .
but it was in the role of director , that link finally saw success : both of her first films - summer days -lrb- sommertage -rrb- , and the children 's film kalle the dreamer -lrb- kalle der träumer -rrb- - received numerous prizes in germany .
in 1996 , link achieved her international breakthrough with beyond silence -lrb- jenseits der stille -rrb- , which was nominated for the foreign language oscar , after receiving numerous other prizes , including the bavarian film award and the german film award .
modesty unchanged despite her shooting star career , link -lrb- photo -rrb- has remained remarkably down to earth : following the news of nowhere in africa 's oscar nomination , the german director said she would " rather stay at home and carry on with her work " than fly to the u.s. for the award ceremony .
" i would probably have some important meetings with important hollywood people , but i really do n't want to be just one in thousands , " she told a news agency .
english translation link also wrote the screenplay for nowhere in africa , which she adapted from the book of the same name by german author , stefanie zweig .
zweig now hopes that the oscar will lead to an english translation of her autobiographical novel which was a huge success in france and has been translated into spanish , hungarian , czech and japanese .
" up till now , we have n't had any success in getting the book translated into english , but now , the american publisher might start to take a bit more notice , " zweig told german news agency , ap .
politics and entertainment despite the war in iraq there was little change to this year 's oscar event .
calls for peace were limited to only two actors , including chris cooper and gael garcia bernal and outfits were slightly more subdued .
there was some protest activity outside the kodak theater in los angeles on sunday .
reuters reported a group of around 50 protesters holding signs saying , " one more american for peace " and " bring u.s. soldiers home " at one main intersection , while at the opposite end of the street , a group of supporters of the u.s.-led attack on iraq waved american flags . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

on television , the images of bombings in iraq come daily , but there has been little information about the scope of casualties and injuries among iraqi civilians and soldiers . in the southern iraqi city basra , 50 people were reportedly killed on saturday after being bombed by a u.s. fighter jet , arab broadcaster al-jazeera reported .
the station broadcast images of dead civilians , including a decapitated child , and injured patients being treated in a local hospital .
hospital workers told the station that entire families and even a russian national had been killed in the air strikes .
officially , the iraqi military has reported 77 deaths and 366 injuries in basra .
the bombing attacks in baghdad , meanwhile , injured at least 100 people during the first three days alone , the international committee of the red cross reported .
on saturday , the iraqi government reported at least 200 injuries and deaths in baghdad , and journalists were taken to hospitals to interview alleged civilian victims .
by comparison , britain and the u.s. have so far lost 23 soldiers in the war .
though the united states and britain have said they will take all possible precautions to prevent civilian casualties , both sides concede that such deaths are inevitable .
" we must realize that no matter how hard we try to avoid them , there will be civilian casualties , " british prime minister tony blair wrote in a newspaper editorial over the weekend .
" but while the dramatic tv pictures have shown the force of the attacks on baghdad , they have also highlighted just how much effort has gone into safeguarding civilians and ensuring the targets are saddam 's regime and machinery of control and terror . "
journalists among victims the first reports of civilian casualties are already pouring in .
five people were killed in northern iraq on saturday in a suicide car bombing , including an australian journalist who was covering the war as a freelance cameraman for the australian broadcasting corporation .
the death of a russian journalist has also been reported in fighting near the southern city of basra .
british private television broadcaster itn has reported that three members of its television crew are missing .
a fourth member of the crew who was injured but made it back to u.s. and british troops confirmed that the men had been shot just outside basra .
whether or not they survived is unknown , but itn has reported the likely death of veteran reporter terry lloyd , a 50-year-old who worked for the company for 20 years .
mass deaths forecast it 's still too early to tell how many casualties the war will create , but one international organization has published gloomy forecasts .
in november , the nobel prize-winning international physicians for the prevention of nuclear war issued a report with estimates of the short- , mid- and longterm consequences of a war against iraq .
in a war lasting only three months , the study predicted , between 48,700 and 261,000 deaths should be expected .
but the estimates did not include deaths that would result from the side-effects of war .
the organization said that the breakdown of iraq 's infrastructure alone could lead to the deaths of as many as 200,000 through infections and other illnesses .
the united nations has also painted a grim portrait of conditions for iraqis .
in a war scenario , up to three million people could be at risk of famine - among them two million children and five and a million women who are either pregnant or breast-feeding infants .
war will exacerbate an already serious situation : the international aid organization world vision says that a quarter of all iraqi suffer from malnutrition , and the death rate of children under five is more than twice as high today as it was in 1990 .
during the 1991 gulf war , the u.s. estimated that up to 110,000 iraqi soldiers were killed and 300,000 wounded .
the number of iraqi civilians killed was estimated at between 3,000 and 40,000 .
on the allied side , 343 soldiers were killed , 148 in battle .
but the majority were killed in accidents , by land mines or through friendly fire from allied troops . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

but although rob marshall 's chicago was favourite to to win the big prizes , it is 35 years since another musical , oliver ! , won big picture .
the movie musical began at the very dawn of sound in films .
the jazz singer , starring al jolson , was the first feature film to use sound in 1927 - it is also seen as a musical , although it was really a silent movie with limited dialogue and song sequences .
but the first proper musical is considered to be broadway melody - and it won best picture oscar in 1930 .
the 1930s saw the golden age of the musical film , with the advent of improved sound technology and cinema-goers thirsty for this style of entertainment .
it did not take long for the best actress oscar to be awarded for the first time to an actress in a musical - luise rainer won in 1937 for her performance in the biopic of florenz ziegfeld 's life , the great ziegfeld .
such was the prestige attached to the first batch of big musicals that film studios could employ eminent songwriters such as irving berlin , cole porter and george gershwin .
mgm led the way in musical making , employing songwriter and producer arthur freed .
it did not take much to lure broadway actors like the great fred astaire to hollywood , and choreographer busby berkeley dominated the genre during its early years .
he breathed life into the genre with his imaginative and extravagant choreography , and became known for his kaleidoscope images using beautiful dancing belles .
one of his major successes was 42nd street in 1933 , starring a 22-year-old ginger rogers .
astaire and rogers made one of the best-loved musical pairings in hollywood history .
the pair began at rko and in six years they made nine films including flying down to rio and top hat .
astaire 's only oscar nomination was for a straight supporting role in the disaster movie towering inferno -lrb- 1975 -rrb- - although he did win an honorary award in 1950 .
the saccharine sweetness of shirley temple proved a winning formula for 20th century fox .
with her cute smile and ringlet hair she made her name in such films as baby take a bow and poor little rich girl , and was given a special oscar as early as the 7th ceremony .
judy garland , who made a highly successful career in musicals with her astounding voice , crowned her achievements early on as dorothy in the musical spectacular the wizard of oz .
although made in 1939 it has become a perennial favourite , consistently attracting new generations of fans - and the academy awarded it best original score and best song for over the rainbow .
garland 's co-star on me and my gal , gene kelly , brought a new kind of dance athletisism to the screen singing in the rain , which he starred in and co-directed , is considered an all-time classic .
the early 50s saw the revival of movie versions of broadway shows including annie get your gun , kiss me kate , seven brides for seven brothers and guys and dolls .
there was also recognition for the musical at the oscars with two picking up best film - an american in paris -lrb- 1951 -rrb- and gigi -lrb- 1958 -rrb- .
and the academy was still enamoured during the 60s .
west side story won 10 oscars , my fair lady collected eight , oliver ! and the sound of music five each .
this period saw the rise of julie andrews as one of the new breed of musical actors .
she won the oscar for mary poppins in 1965 and was nominated for the sound of music the next year .
that film went on to become the most successful movie at the box office ever , outdoing previous leader gone with the wind .
but the 70s and 80s gave way to grittier films and the musical seemed to have had its day , with only cabaret , itself a gritty musical , and all that jazz making waves .
alan parker revived the genre in 1980 with fame , which had a raw realism and setting .
parker had already scored a success with bugsy malone in 1977 .
but alongside the traditional musicals , the 50s saw the rise of the rock and roll films .
elvis presley was the undisputed king of the rock movie with releases such as jailhouse rock and viva las vegas .
the beatles got in on the act with a hard day 's night in 1964 followed by the who 's tommy in 1975 .
these gave way to the pop / dance movies starting with saturday night fever in 1977 .
the following year grease was the must-see movie - and its appeal is still felt today thanks to a re-release and its office party sing-a-long hits .
but musicals fell out of fashion with the public and the academy during the 1980s and 1990s , despite parker 's evita in 1996 , with madonna in the lead role .
in 2001 , director baz luhrmann , always one to try something different , created the lavish musical moulin rouge for the big screen , starring nicole kidman .
although largely ignored by the academy , it was a great commercial success .
now chicago , with six oscars and a host of other awards , seems to have brought the genre firmly back into the limelight .

but although rob marshall 's chicago was favourite to to win the big prizes , it is 35 years since another musical , oliver ! , won big picture .
the movie musical began at the very dawn of sound in films .
the jazz singer , starring al jolson , was the first feature film to use sound in 1927 - it is also seen as a musical , although it was really a silent movie with limited dialogue and song sequences .
but the first proper musical is considered to be broadway melody - and it won best picture oscar in 1930 .
the 1930s saw the golden age of the musical film , with the advent of improved sound technology and cinema-goers thirsty for this style of entertainment .
luise rainer became the first musical actress to win an oscar it did not take long for the best actress oscar to be awarded for the first time to an actress in a musical - luise rainer won in 1937 for her performance in the biopic of florenz ziegfeld 's life , the great ziegfeld .
such was the prestige attached to the first batch of big musicals that film studios could employ eminent songwriters such as irving berlin , cole porter and george gershwin .
mgm led the way in musical making , employing songwriter and producer arthur freed .
it did not take much to lure broadway actors like the great fred astaire to hollywood , and choreographer busby berkeley dominated the genre during its early years .
he breathed life into the genre with his imaginative and extravagant choreography , and became known for his kaleidoscope images using beautiful dancing belles .
one of his major successes was 42nd street in 1933 , starring a 22-year-old ginger rogers .
fred astaire was one of the best-loved musical stars astaire and rogers made one of the best-loved musical pairings in hollywood history .
the pair began at rko and in six years they made nine films including flying down to rio and top hat .
astaire 's only oscar nomination was for a straight supporting role in the disaster movie towering inferno -lrb- 1975 -rrb- - although he did win an honorary award in 1950 .
the saccharine sweetness of shirley temple proved a winning formula for 20th century fox .
with her cute smile and ringlet hair she made her name in such films as baby take a bow and poor little rich girl , and was given a special oscar as early as the 7th ceremony .
judy garland , who made a highly successful career in musicals with her astounding voice , crowned her achievements early on as dorothy in the musical spectacular the wizard of oz .
although made in 1939 it has become a perennial favourite , consistently attracting new generations of fans - and the academy awarded it best original score and best song for over the rainbow .
julie andrews : the sound of music smash garland 's co-star on me and my gal , gene kelly , brought a new kind of dance athletisism to the screen singing in the rain , which he starred in and co-directed , is considered an all-time classic .
the early 50s saw the revival of movie versions of broadway shows including annie get your gun , kiss me kate , seven brides for seven brothers and guys and dolls .
there was also recognition for the musical at the oscars with two picking up best film - an american in paris -lrb- 1951 -rrb- and gigi -lrb- 1958 -rrb- .
and the academy was still enamoured during the 60s .
west side story won 10 oscars , my fair lady collected eight , oliver ! and the sound of music five each .
this period saw the rise of julie andrews as one of the new breed of musical actors .
she won the oscar for mary poppins in 1965 and was nominated for the sound of music the next year .
madonna : tried musical acting in 1996 's evita that film went on to become the most successful movie at the box office ever , outdoing previous leader gone with the wind .
but the 70s and 80s gave way to grittier films and the musical seemed to have had its day , with only cabaret , itself a gritty musical , and all that jazz making waves .
alan parker revived the genre in 1980 with fame , which had a raw realism and setting .
parker had already scored a success with bugsy malone in 1977 .
but alongside the traditional musicals , the 50s saw the rise of the rock and roll films .
moulin rouge exploded onto the movie scene in 2001 elvis presley was the undisputed king of the rock movie with releases such as jailhouse rock and viva las vegas .
the beatles got in on the act with a hard day 's night in 1964 followed by the who 's tommy in 1975 .
these gave way to the pop / dance movies starting with saturday night fever in 1977 .
the following year grease was the must-see movie - and its appeal is still felt today thanks to a re-release and its office party sing-a-long hits .
but musicals fell out of fashion with the public and the academy during the 1980s and 1990s , despite parker 's evita in 1996 , with madonna in the lead role .
in 2001 , director baz luhrmann , always one to try something different , created the lavish musical moulin rouge for the big screen , starring nicole kidman .
chicago : tickled the academy although largely ignored by the academy , it was a great commercial success .
now chicago , with six oscars and a host of other awards , seems to have brought the genre firmly back into the limelight .

but she has been nominated for oscars three times before , and colleen atwood had feared she would " always be the bridesmaid " .
she was hotly tipped to win her first award in 2003 , having created the characters ' clothes for the oscars favourite chicago and recently winning the costume industry 's own award .
she is now one of the most experienced and reliable designers in the business , having co-ordinated the costumes for films as diverse as the silence of the lambs , mars attacks and the planet of the apes .
costume designers may not get much of the spotlight in the film world , but ms atwood is in no doubt about the role her branch of film-making plays in bringing characters to life .
" costume , hair and makeup can tell you instantly , or at least give you a larger perception of who a character is , " she said .
" it 's the first impression that you have of the character before they open their mouth , so it really does establish who they are . "
for chicago 's distinctive jazz-era style , she helped create and define the main characters through absorbing the screenplay , doing research into the period and working with the look of the actors , she said .
" knowing who the actors were as you were designing them helped , with catherine 's beauty and renee 's frailty , they directed me visually just by who they were . "
catherine zeta jones ' character , the nightclub diva velma kelly , was " the kind of girl that would wear a cocktail dress to lunch , " ms atwood said .
but renee zellweger 's character , the fame-hungry roxie hart , had " much more rawness in the exterior " , so her clothes were made to reflect that .
" as she toughened up and became her own fantasy , then her costume became much harder and more protective , " she said .
one of zellweger 's costumes , a beaded dress , was created after ms atwood found a " totally trashed " original 1930s dress in a film studio .
she set about recreating it , even finding vintage beads to give it a similar look .
one of richard gere 's suits , which he wore in the film , was actually an original suit from the era .
" it really set the character for us , " she said .
as well as recalling the historical period and looking good , chicago 's stylish and glittering costumes had to be practical when worn for the film 's rigorous dance scenes .
" i had to work out that it was something that could move and your arm could go straight over your head , and so could your leg , and all that technical stuff , without having everybody in spray painted leotards , " she said .
" it was very challenging in that way . "
but that was something she learned when she worked on a very different film - the planet of the apes .
" planet of the apes was a gigantic challenge , but one of the main challenges was making the clothes work so people could to the movement and stunts and action in the clothes .
i really learned a lot about that in that movie , " she said .
" and because i walked into chicago knowing that , i knew what the dancers were going to need .
so i did n't have to go through a huge process of making something that was n't going to work . "

but she has been nominated for oscars three times before , and colleen atwood had feared she would " always be the bridesmaid " .
she was hotly tipped to win her first award in 2003 , having created the characters ' clothes for the oscars favourite chicago and recently winning the costume industry 's own award .
she is now one of the most experienced and reliable designers in the business , having co-ordinated the costumes for films as diverse as the silence of the lambs , mars attacks and the planet of the apes .
costume designers may not get much of the spotlight in the film world , but ms atwood is in no doubt about the role her branch of film-making plays in bringing characters to life .
" costume , hair and makeup can tell you instantly , or at least give you a larger perception of who a character is , " she said .
" it 's the first impression that you have of the character before they open their mouth , so it really does establish who they are . "
for chicago 's distinctive jazz-era style , she helped create and define the main characters through absorbing the screenplay , doing research into the period and working with the look of the actors , she said .
" knowing who the actors were as you were designing them helped , with catherine 's beauty and renee 's frailty , they directed me visually just by who they were . "
catherine zeta jones ' character , the nightclub diva velma kelly , was " the kind of girl that would wear a cocktail dress to lunch , " ms atwood said .
but renee zellweger 's character , the fame-hungry roxie hart , had " much more rawness in the exterior " , so her clothes were made to reflect that .
" as she toughened up and became her own fantasy , then her costume became much harder and more protective , " she said .
one of zellweger 's costumes , a beaded dress , was created after ms atwood found a " totally trashed " original 1930s dress in a film studio .
she set about recreating it , even finding vintage beads to give it a similar look .
one of richard gere 's suits , which he wore in the film , was actually an original suit from the era .
" it really set the character for us , " she said .
as well as recalling the historical period and looking good , chicago 's stylish and glittering costumes had to be practical when worn for the film 's rigorous dance scenes .
" i had to work out that it was something that could move and your arm could go straight over your head , and so could your leg , and all that technical stuff , without having everybody in spray painted leotards , " she said .
" it was very challenging in that way . "
but that was something she learned when she worked on a very different film - the planet of the apes .
" planet of the apes was a gigantic challenge , but one of the main challenges was making the clothes work so people could to the movement and stunts and action in the clothes .
i really learned a lot about that in that movie , " she said .
" and because i walked into chicago knowing that , i knew what the dancers were going to need .
so i did n't have to go through a huge process of making something that was n't going to work . "
