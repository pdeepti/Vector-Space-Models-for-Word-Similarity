the 23-year-old from glasgow captured a majority of the 10.2 million public votes that were cast for the itv1 show .
michelle had been the bookies ' favourite to beat 21-year-old mark , from walsall in the west midlands .
the show 's judges , including pete waterman and neil fox , said the whole series had been a success because the outcome had been so unpredictable .
michelle , who has won a recording deal , said : " to everyone who said i could n't do it , i 've done it ! "
' broken the norm ' pop idol judge simon cowell - a staunch supporter of michelle throughout the series - said that she had " broken the norm " of pop stars .
it was reported that fellow judge pete waterman , who was critical of michelle 's early progress in the contest , swiftly exited the studio after the result was announced .
michelle is due to release a specially-written debut single all this time next year .
she said she would be moving to london with her two best friends .
i am part of the british public and we wo n't vote for people because we feel sorry for them , we vote for them because they are talented michelle mcmanus " whether it lasts a year or 20 years , i 'm going to give it my best shot , " michelle added .
" i just want to do really well and i 'll break my back in trying , " she said .
" i have n't come from anywhere - i was nobody six months ago . "
michelle denied she had won on a sympathy vote .
" i am part of the british public and we wo n't vote for people because we feel sorry for them , we vote for them because they are talented , " she said .
michelle said she would like to perform a duet with meatloaf .
losing finalist mark rhodes was seen as the outsider the signer had wished her luck and sent flowers after hearing she had been compared to him , she added .
the programme amassed a greater total of votes than the first series finale , which accrued 8.7 million for the showdown between will young and gareth gates .
the show is also thought to have attracted a record number of text messages for an interactive television programme .
it is estimated that around 15 million viewers watched the second series reach its conclusion .
runner-up mark was seen as the dark horse in the final , having narrowly escaped elimination in the earlier stages of the series .
simon cowell told him during his final performances that if he won , it would be one for " ordinary bloke idol " .
scottish pride bookmakers ladbrookes said they have been " taken to the cleaners " by punters who put early bets on michelle to win at odds of 33/1 .
scottish first minister jack mcconnell said he voted for michelle and congratulated her on winning pop idol .
" michelle brought sparkle to the contest and real hope and then pride to scotland , " he said .
" this is a big signal to young scots , if you have the ambition and go for it , you can win . "

it is the second drugs haul in the region in recent days , as the us steps up efforts to tackle al-qaeda funding .
on friday , the navy said the uss decatur had seized almost two tons of hashish valued at up to $ 10m aboard a boat near the straits of hormuz .
of the 12 people detained in that operation , the us believes three have links to al-qaeda .
smuggling routes " we are investigating potential al-qaeda connections to these operations , " rear admiral jim stavridis from the us navy said on saturday .
smuggling routes in the region are known to be used by al-qaeda , says the us military - which describes the seizures as " a vital part of winning the global war on terror " .
the two boats were first spotted on thursday and for 48 hours were tracked across the region , the navy says .
after boarding the first ship , it uncovered 67 kilogrammes -lrb- 150 pounds -rrb- of methamphetamines .
the us navy statement said the second ship attempted to flee , and its crew tried to dump their cargo .
about 200 white bags were thrown overboard during the chase which was filmed by a us navy aircraft .
when the boat was finally intercepted , two remaining bags containing 38kg -lrb- 85 pounds -rrb- of substance believed to be pure heroin were found .

an ancient buddhist ritual was recently performed in bhutan , a land of tradition , to celebrate the launch of a most contemporary service .
proud workers from bhutan telecom joined dignitaries to watch the country take its first steps into the mobile age .
there was barely a cellphone in sight , which betrays the significant fact that the coming of the mobile in this rural nation , some of whose citizens still use morse code , really is momentous .
" if the world has adjusted itself why not bhutan ? " said sangey tenzing , managing director of bhutan telecom .
" this is going to improve the quality of life , the way things are run , enable people to do their business much more effectively and efficiently . "
expensive business thimpu , the capital , is one of the few places where the network is up and running , and it is the talk of the town . "
we have had to rush to get more supplies of phones as we had run out of the previous stock that we had calculated " passang dorji , shop owner at retail outlets , potential customers eye up phones which would happily stand up to scrutiny in far more developed markets .
they are far from cheap and call prices are out of reach of most bhutanese .
but being mobile is the latest status symbol for the aspiring classes , and so business is booming for vendors of the new equipment .
" we really did n't think it would take off so much because comparatively it is much more expensive to call mobile phones , " said passang dorji , owner of the shop eworld .
" in the last few weeks i have seen that people are rushing in for phones .
we have had to rush to get more supplies of phones as we had run out of the previous stock that we had calculated . "
" it 's beyond everybody 's expectations . "
until now bhutanese people wanting a taste of mobility have had to rely on bulky and inelegant cordless phones connected to their landlines .
for business people the mobile is a revelation .
" the old cordless phone has had its uses and it has definitely served me very well , " said businesswoman phub zam .
" but the mobile phone would be much more convenient , i think , much lighter to use , and people would be able to contact me wherever i am in the country . "
early hiccups invariably there have been a few teething problems .
there was such an initial rush to top up pre-paid accounts with credit that it crashed the automated computer system .
there is a learning process that has to take place as well , because bhutanese are expecting too much from their phones - the phones can deliver but the networks can not .
for the 2,000 subscribers , there is a real danger of creating an expectations gap , which even officials acknowledge has to be closed quickly .
" there is no point having the equipment if you ca n't fully utilise it , " said communications minister lyonpo leki dorji .
" you have to have data and content in place , you have to have the proper infrastructure , like broadband , before you can use the latest mobile phone . "
infrastructure or no infrastructure , the fact is that for now the impact of mobile communications will be limited .
life in rural bhutan , home to most of the population , will remain largely untouched by this leap of technology .
outside the cities life is basic and few people own any kind of phone , relying instead on central communication centres which use microwave links to direct traffic around the country .
bhutan is a country where technology plays second fiddle to nature .
change happens at a glacial rate , but now at least it can proudly claim a small stake in the communications revolution .

a new generation will grow up with mobile phones an ancient buddhist ritual was recently performed in bhutan , a land of tradition , to celebrate the launch of a most contemporary service .
proud workers from bhutan telecom joined dignitaries to watch the country take its first steps into the mobile age .
there was barely a cellphone in sight , which betrays the significant fact that the coming of the mobile in this rural nation , some of whose citizens still use morse code , really is momentous .
" if the world has adjusted itself why not bhutan ? " said sangey tenzing , managing director of bhutan telecom .
" this is going to improve the quality of life , the way things are run , enable people to do their business much more effectively and efficiently . "
expensive business thimpu , the capital , is one of the few places where the network is up and running , and it is the talk of the town .
we have had to rush to get more supplies of phones as we had run out of the previous stock that we had calculated passang dorji , shop owner at retail outlets , potential customers eye up phones which would happily stand up to scrutiny in far more developed markets .
they are far from cheap and call prices are out of reach of most bhutanese .
but being mobile is the latest status symbol for the aspiring classes , and so business is booming for vendors of the new equipment .
" we really did n't think it would take off so much because comparatively it is much more expensive to call mobile phones , " said passang dorji , owner of the shop eworld .
" in the last few weeks i have seen that people are rushing in for phones .
we have had to rush to get more supplies of phones as we had run out of the previous stock that we had calculated . "
" it 's beyond everybody 's expectations . "
until now bhutanese people wanting a taste of mobility have had to rely on bulky and inelegant cordless phones connected to their landlines .
for business people the mobile is a revelation .
" the old cordless phone has had its uses and it has definitely served me very well , " said businesswoman phub zam .
" but the mobile phone would be much more convenient , i think , much lighter to use , and people would be able to contact me wherever i am in the country . "
early hiccups invariably there have been a few teething problems .
there was such an initial rush to top up pre-paid accounts with credit that it crashed the automated computer system .
the mobiles are out of the reach of many there is a learning process that has to take place as well , because bhutanese are expecting too much from their phones - the phones can deliver but the networks can not .
for the 2,000 subscribers , there is a real danger of creating an expectations gap , which even officials acknowledge has to be closed quickly .
" there is no point having the equipment if you ca n't fully utilise it , " said communications minister lyonpo leki dorji .
" you have to have data and content in place , you have to have the proper infrastructure , like broadband , before you can use the latest mobile phone . "
infrastructure or no infrastructure , the fact is that for now the impact of mobile communications will be limited .
life in rural bhutan , home to most of the population , will remain largely untouched by this leap of technology .
outside the cities life is basic and few people own any kind of phone , relying instead on central communication centres which use microwave links to direct traffic around the country .
bhutan is a country where technology plays second fiddle to nature .
change happens at a glacial rate , but now at least it can proudly claim a small stake in the communications revolution .

a new generation will grow up with mobile phones an ancient buddhist ritual was recently performed in bhutan , a land of tradition , to celebrate the launch of a most contemporary service .
proud workers from bhutan telecom joined dignitaries to watch the country take its first steps into the mobile age .
there was barely a cellphone in sight , which betrays the significant fact that the coming of the mobile in this rural nation , some of whose citizens still use morse code , really is momentous .
" if the world has adjusted itself why not bhutan ? " said sangey tenzing , managing director of bhutan telecom .
" this is going to improve the quality of life , the way things are run , enable people to do their business much more effectively and efficiently . "
expensive business thimpu , the capital , is one of the few places where the network is up and running , and it is the talk of the town .
we have had to rush to get more supplies of phones as we had run out of the previous stock that we had calculated passang dorji , shop owner at retail outlets , potential customers eye up phones which would happily stand up to scrutiny in far more developed markets .
they are far from cheap and call prices are out of reach of most bhutanese .
but being mobile is the latest status symbol for the aspiring classes , and so business is booming for vendors of the new equipment .

we have had to rush to get more supplies of phones as we had run out of the previous stock that we had calculated . "
" it 's beyond everybody 's expectations . "
until now bhutanese people wanting a taste of mobility have had to rely on bulky and inelegant cordless phones connected to their landlines .
for business people the mobile is a revelation .
" the old cordless phone has had its uses and it has definitely served me very well , " said businesswoman phub zam .
" but the mobile phone would be much more convenient , i think , much lighter to use , and people would be able to contact me wherever i am in the country . "
early hiccups invariably there have been a few teething problems .
there was such an initial rush to top up pre-paid accounts with credit that it crashed the automated computer system .
the mobiles are out of the reach of many there is a learning process that has to take place as well , because bhutanese are expecting too much from their phones - the phones can deliver but the networks can not .
for the 2,000 subscribers , there is a real danger of creating an expectations gap , which even officials acknowledge has to be closed quickly .
" there is no point having the equipment if you ca n't fully utilise it , " said communications minister lyonpo leki dorji .
" you have to have data and content in place , you have to have the proper infrastructure , like broadband , before you can use the latest mobile phone . "
infrastructure or no infrastructure , the fact is that for now the impact of mobile communications will be limited .
life in rural bhutan , home to most of the population , will remain largely untouched by this leap of technology .
outside the cities life is basic and few people own any kind of phone , relying instead on central communication centres which use microwave links to direct traffic around the country .

since the virus was discovered at a farm 80km -lrb- 50 miles -rrb- south of seoul last week , more than 200,000 chickens and ducks have been culled .
the meeting took place as another farm was found to be infected .
however , there is no proof yet that the south korean strain of the avian flu can infect human beings .
a variant of the virus killed seven people in hong kong five years ago .
the south korean government has deployed hundreds of troops to help slaughter and bury the birds .
they have been vaccinated against the virus .
exports halted no infections have been reported so far among the farm workers who have been tested .
but since the outbreak was discovered , the country 's chicken and duck exports to japan , hong kong and china have stopped and domestic consumption of birds has slumped .
in a bid to show that local poultry was still safe to eat , south korean agriculture minister huh sang-man on friday feasted on a duck lunch with other members of parliament local producers say the flu might put them out of business in a matter of months .
