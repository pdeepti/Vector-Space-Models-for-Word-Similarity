"
german chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday renewed his criticism of the u.s.-led war in iraq and said the united nations must have a central role in any post-war reconstruction . in a major foreign policy speech to parliament , schröder also said iraq ’ s territorial integrity must be guaranteed and its natural resources need to be controlled by the iraqi people . “ the united nations will be indispensable for the reconstruction process , ” schröder said .
“ because reconstruction is more than just the repair of buildings , oil fields and infrastructure . ” schröder ’ s speech comes as u.s. secretary of state colin powell meets his european counterparts in brussels to discuss what will be a massive effort to rebuild iraq after the war .
several european nations have expressed concern that the united states is preparing to forego a multilateral political solution after defeating the regime of iraqi president saddam hussein . the united states has not explicitly said it would install a military commander to lead iraq after the war , but washington is sure to want influence in baghdad after leading the war effort to oust hussein .
but nations such as france and germany are loath to help pay for rebuilding iraq on washington ’ s terms after opposing the war in the first place . anti-war stance remains popular schröder ’ s anti-war stance has been extremely popular in germany and in thursday ’ s speech the chancellor renewed the government ’ s commitment to its peace policies , saying only the united nations should be able to sanction the use of military force to solve international conflicts . “ we were and are convinced that there was an alternative to war .
iraq could have disarmed peacefully through international inspections , ” he said .
“ now as then , this government considers it a mistake that this path was not taken . ” angel merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats , said the anti-war stance of schröder ’ s center-left coalition was a populist move , which ended up taking pressure off iraq to work with u.n. weapons inspectors .
“ it made war more likely , rather than unlikely , ” she said . despite his rejection of the u.s.-led war , schröder said he hoped saddam hussein ’ s dictatorship would be quickly toppled and the iraqi people could take control of their affairs as soon as possible . joint e.u. peacekeepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un peacekeer helmet he also said the war presented an opportunity to press ahead with the development of a common e.u. foreign and defense policy .
schröder said a first step could be to set up a joint e.u. peacekeeping troop for u.n. operations instead of each nation sending its own contingent .
he also reiterated support for a european foreign minister . german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday mooted the idea of proceeding with joint security policy with only a small core of e.u. member states .
in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper , fischer said if a solution could not be agreed upon in a e.u.-wide treaty , then countries that were willing could move forward on their own .
he said other e.u. nations would then be able to join later on as they wished . in his speech to parliament , schröder singled out the importance of having britain on board any such initiative : “ it ’ s particularly important to me that great britain , which has been so important for driving european security and defense policy in the past , is part of this process . ” some european politicians have singled out british prime minister tony blair ’ s unwavering support for u.s. president george bush as a main cause of the rift within europe over the war in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
german chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday renewed his criticism of the u.s.-led war in iraq and said the united nations must have a central role in any post-war reconstruction . in a major foreign policy speech to parliament , schröder also said iraq ’ s territorial integrity must be guaranteed and its natural resources need to be controlled by the iraqi people . “ the united nations will be indispensable for the reconstruction process , ” schröder said .
“ because reconstruction is more than just the repair of buildings , oil fields and infrastructure . ” schröder ’ s speech comes as u.s. secretary of state colin powell meets his european counterparts in brussels to discuss what will be a massive effort to rebuild iraq after the war .
several european nations have expressed concern that the united states is preparing to forego a multilateral political solution after defeating the regime of iraqi president saddam hussein . the united states has not explicitly said it would install a military commander to lead iraq after the war , but washington is sure to want influence in baghdad after leading the war effort to oust hussein .
but nations such as france and germany are loath to help pay for rebuilding iraq on washington ’ s terms after opposing the war in the first place . anti-war stance remains popular schröder ’ s anti-war stance has been extremely popular in germany and in thursday ’ s speech the chancellor renewed the government ’ s commitment to its peace policies , saying only the united nations should be able to sanction the use of military force to solve international conflicts . “ we were and are convinced that there was an alternative to war .

their conflict may continue on the administration of the country after the war as well . u.s. secretary of state colin powell , the general turned diplomat , returned to brussels on thursday to consult with opponents of the american-led war against the regime of saddam hussein about the shape of a postwar iraq .
like the war itself , questions about postwar iraq have fueled continuing trans-atlantic tension .
the european union wants the united nations to take a key role .
but officials in washington want the united states to remain in charge of running the oil-rich country if saddam is toppled , arguing it has risked the lives of its troops and spent billions of dollars to prepare iraq for representative government .
powell , in his strongest comments on the subject , said last month that the united states would not cede control of iraq to the united nations , as some europeans have demanded .
during thursday 's meetings , powell called for a " partnership " with the united nations to rebuild iraq after the war , an official told reporters .
but , the official said it was too early to define exactly what role the united nations would have .
" there has to be a partnership with the u.n.
-lrb- we -rrb- ca n't say when that would all start , " he said .
role for retired general foreseen the current american plan calls for a u.s. administrator , retired lt. gen. jay garner , to run iraq in conjunction with u.s. and british forces until the united states can set up an " interim iraqi authority " with limited powers .
the powers of the interim authority would gradually increase until an independent iraqi government took over , but u.s. officials have rarely indicated how long that would take .
one senior state department official has said the military occupation could last two years .
schröder at odds again with bush in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , a leading opponent to the war , staked out a position on thursday that puts him once again at odds with the united states .
schröder said iraq 's oil and natural resources must remain under the control of the iraqi people .
" after this war , the united nations must play the central role as far as the future of iraq and the new political order is concerned .
i would warn against speculating at this point about the details of the necessary reconstruction of iraq , " he told german parliament .
the centerpiece of thursday 's negotiations was an informal two-hour lunch that brought together 23 foreign ministers .
europeans object to proposal a day before the meeting , greek foreign minister george papandreou , spelled out some of the european objections to the u.s. plans for the administration of iraq and called the concerns substantial .
" we believe that the presence of an american general in command in iraq is completely different from the existence of an iraqi government or a procedure under the united nations for a transitional period , " he said .
after thursday 's lunch , papandreou seemed conciliatory .
" we are seeing an emerging consensus on these issues , " he said .
powell planned to hold more than 20 separate and mostly closed-door meetings with european and nato foreign ministers at the alliance headquarters in brusssels .
his partners included france 's foreign minister , dominique de villepin , who helped lead the diplomatic opposition to the war .
powell was also attending a meeting of nato 's north atlantic council , the alliance 's decision-making authority , at the level of foreign ministers .
according to diplomats , powell planned to call for nato to play a military role in postwar iraq , a proposal already received coolly by anti-war european states .
nato was plunged into an unprecedented crisis in february after germany , france and belgium blocked a u.s. request to help boost turkey 's defenses in preparation for a war .

"
german chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday renewed his criticism of the u.s.-led war in iraq and said the united nations must have a central role in any post-war reconstruction . in a major foreign policy speech to parliament , schröder also said iraq ’ s territorial integrity must be guaranteed and its natural resources need to be controlled by the iraqi people . “ the united nations will be indispensable for the reconstruction process , ” schröder said .
“ because reconstruction is more than just the repair of buildings , oil fields and infrastructure . ” schröder ’ s speech comes as u.s. secretary of state colin powell meets his european counterparts in brussels to discuss what will be a massive effort to rebuild iraq after the war .
several european nations have expressed concern that the united states is preparing to forego a multilateral political solution after defeating the regime of iraqi president saddam hussein . the united states has not explicitly said it would install a military commander to lead iraq after the war , but washington is sure to want influence in baghdad after leading the war effort to oust hussein .
but nations such as france and germany are loath to help pay for rebuilding iraq on washington ’ s terms after opposing the war in the first place . anti-war stance remains popular schröder ’ s anti-war stance has been extremely popular in germany and in thursday ’ s speech the chancellor renewed the government ’ s commitment to its peace policies , saying only the united nations should be able to sanction the use of military force to solve international conflicts . “ we were and are convinced that there was an alternative to war .
iraq could have disarmed peacefully through international inspections , ” he said .
“ now as then , this government considers it a mistake that this path was not taken . ” angel merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats , said the anti-war stance of schröder ’ s center-left coalition was a populist move , which ended up taking pressure off iraq to work with u.n. weapons inspectors .
“ it made war more likely , rather than unlikely , ” she said . despite his rejection of the u.s.-led war , schröder said he hoped saddam hussein ’ s dictatorship would be quickly toppled and the iraqi people could take control of their affairs as soon as possible . joint e.u. peacekeepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un peacekeer helmet he also said the war presented an opportunity to press ahead with the development of a common e.u. foreign and defense policy .
schröder said a first step could be to set up a joint e.u. peacekeeping troop for u.n. operations instead of each nation sending its own contingent .
he also reiterated support for a european foreign minister . german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday mooted the idea of proceeding with joint security policy with only a small core of e.u. member states .
in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper , fischer said if a solution could not be agreed upon in a e.u.-wide treaty , then countries that were willing could move forward on their own .
he said other e.u. nations would then be able to join later on as they wished . in his speech to parliament , schröder singled out the importance of having britain on board any such initiative : “ it ’ s particularly important to me that great britain , which has been so important for driving european security and defense policy in the past , is part of this process . ” some european politicians have singled out british prime minister tony blair ’ s unwavering support for u.s. president george bush as a main cause of the rift within europe over the war in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

their conflict may continue on the administration of the country after the war as well . u.s. secretary of state colin powell , the general turned diplomat , returned to brussels on thursday to consult with opponents of the american-led war against the regime of saddam hussein about the shape of a postwar iraq .
like the war itself , questions about postwar iraq have fueled continuing trans-atlantic tension .
the european union wants the united nations to take a key role .
but officials in washington want the united states to remain in charge of running the oil-rich country if saddam is toppled , arguing it has risked the lives of its troops and spent billions of dollars to prepare iraq for representative government .
powell , in his strongest comments on the subject , said last month that the united states would not cede control of iraq to the united nations , as some europeans have demanded .
during thursday 's meetings , powell called for a " partnership " with the united nations to rebuild iraq after the war , an official told reporters .
but , the official said it was too early to define exactly what role the united nations would have .
" there has to be a partnership with the u.n.
-lrb- we -rrb- ca n't say when that would all start , " he said .
role for retired general foreseen the current american plan calls for a u.s. administrator , retired lt. gen. jay garner , to run iraq in conjunction with u.s. and british forces until the united states can set up an " interim iraqi authority " with limited powers .
the powers of the interim authority would gradually increase until an independent iraqi government took over , but u.s. officials have rarely indicated how long that would take .
one senior state department official has said the military occupation could last two years .
schröder at odds again with bush in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , a leading opponent to the war , staked out a position on thursday that puts him once again at odds with the united states .
schröder said iraq 's oil and natural resources must remain under the control of the iraqi people .
" after this war , the united nations must play the central role as far as the future of iraq and the new political order is concerned .
i would warn against speculating at this point about the details of the necessary reconstruction of iraq , " he told german parliament .
the centerpiece of thursday 's negotiations was an informal two-hour lunch that brought together 23 foreign ministers .
europeans object to proposal a day before the meeting , greek foreign minister george papandreou , spelled out some of the european objections to the u.s. plans for the administration of iraq and called the concerns substantial .
" we believe that the presence of an american general in command in iraq is completely different from the existence of an iraqi government or a procedure under the united nations for a transitional period , " he said .
after thursday 's lunch , papandreou seemed conciliatory .
" we are seeing an emerging consensus on these issues , " he said .
powell planned to hold more than 20 separate and mostly closed-door meetings with european and nato foreign ministers at the alliance headquarters in brusssels .
his partners included france 's foreign minister , dominique de villepin , who helped lead the diplomatic opposition to the war .
powell was also attending a meeting of nato 's north atlantic council , the alliance 's decision-making authority , at the level of foreign ministers .
according to diplomats , powell planned to call for nato to play a military role in postwar iraq , a proposal already received coolly by anti-war european states .
nato was plunged into an unprecedented crisis in february after germany , france and belgium blocked a u.s. request to help boost turkey 's defenses in preparation for a war .

their conflict may continue on the administration of the country after the war as well . u.s. secretary of state colin powell , the general turned diplomat , returned to brussels on thursday to consult with opponents of the american-led war against the regime of saddam hussein about the shape of a postwar iraq .
like the war itself , questions about postwar iraq have fueled continuing trans-atlantic tension .
the european union wants the united nations to take a key role .
but officials in washington want the united states to remain in charge of running the oil-rich country if saddam is toppled , arguing it has risked the lives of its troops and spent billions of dollars to prepare iraq for representative government .
powell , in his strongest comments on the subject , said last month that the united states would not cede control of iraq to the united nations , as some europeans have demanded .
during thursday 's meetings , powell called for a " partnership " with the united nations to rebuild iraq after the war , an official told reporters .
but , the official said it was too early to define exactly what role the united nations would have .
" there has to be a partnership with the u.n.
-lrb- we -rrb- ca n't say when that would all start , " he said .
role for retired general foreseen the current american plan calls for a u.s. administrator , retired lt. gen. jay garner , to run iraq in conjunction with u.s. and british forces until the united states can set up an " interim iraqi authority " with limited powers .
the powers of the interim authority would gradually increase until an independent iraqi government took over , but u.s. officials have rarely indicated how long that would take .
one senior state department official has said the military occupation could last two years .
schröder at odds again with bush in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , a leading opponent to the war , staked out a position on thursday that puts him once again at odds with the united states .
schröder said iraq 's oil and natural resources must remain under the control of the iraqi people .
" after this war , the united nations must play the central role as far as the future of iraq and the new political order is concerned .
i would warn against speculating at this point about the details of the necessary reconstruction of iraq , " he told german parliament .
the centerpiece of thursday 's negotiations was an informal two-hour lunch that brought together 23 foreign ministers .
europeans object to proposal a day before the meeting , greek foreign minister george papandreou , spelled out some of the european objections to the u.s. plans for the administration of iraq and called the concerns substantial .
" we believe that the presence of an american general in command in iraq is completely different from the existence of an iraqi government or a procedure under the united nations for a transitional period , " he said .
after thursday 's lunch , papandreou seemed conciliatory .
" we are seeing an emerging consensus on these issues , " he said .
powell planned to hold more than 20 separate and mostly closed-door meetings with european and nato foreign ministers at the alliance headquarters in brusssels .
his partners included france 's foreign minister , dominique de villepin , who helped lead the diplomatic opposition to the war .
powell was also attending a meeting of nato 's north atlantic council , the alliance 's decision-making authority , at the level of foreign ministers .
according to diplomats , powell planned to call for nato to play a military role in postwar iraq , a proposal already received coolly by anti-war european states .
nato was plunged into an unprecedented crisis in february after germany , france and belgium blocked a u.s. request to help boost turkey 's defenses in preparation for a war .

but officials in washington want the united states to remain in charge of running the oil-rich country if saddam is toppled , arguing it has risked the lives of its troops and spent billions of dollars to prepare iraq for representative government .
powell , in his strongest comments on the subject , said last month that the united states would not cede control of iraq to the united nations , as some europeans have demanded .
during thursday 's meetings , powell called for a " partnership " with the united nations to rebuild iraq after the war , an official told reporters .
but , the official said it was too early to define exactly what role the united nations would have .
" there has to be a partnership with the u.n.
-lrb- we -rrb- ca n't say when that would all start , " he said .
role for retired general foreseen the current american plan calls for a u.s. administrator , retired lt. gen. jay garner , to run iraq in conjunction with u.s. and british forces until the united states can set up an " interim iraqi authority " with limited powers .
the powers of the interim authority would gradually increase until an independent iraqi government took over , but u.s. officials have rarely indicated how long that would take .
one senior state department official has said the military occupation could last two years .
schröder at odds again with bush in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , a leading opponent to the war , staked out a position on thursday that puts him once again at odds with the united states .
schröder said iraq 's oil and natural resources must remain under the control of the iraqi people .
" after this war , the united nations must play the central role as far as the future of iraq and the new political order is concerned .
i would warn against speculating at this point about the details of the necessary reconstruction of iraq , " he told german parliament .
the centerpiece of thursday 's negotiations was an informal two-hour lunch that brought together 23 foreign ministers .
europeans object to proposal a day before the meeting , greek foreign minister george papandreou , spelled out some of the european objections to the u.s. plans for the administration of iraq and called the concerns substantial .
" we believe that the presence of an american general in command in iraq is completely different from the existence of an iraqi government or a procedure under the united nations for a transitional period , " he said .
after thursday 's lunch , papandreou seemed conciliatory .
" we are seeing an emerging consensus on these issues , " he said .
powell planned to hold more than 20 separate and mostly closed-door meetings with european and nato foreign ministers at the alliance headquarters in brusssels .
his partners included france 's foreign minister , dominique de villepin , who helped lead the diplomatic opposition to the war .
powell was also attending a meeting of nato 's north atlantic council , the alliance 's decision-making authority , at the level of foreign ministers .
according to diplomats , powell planned to call for nato to play a military role in postwar iraq , a proposal already received coolly by anti-war european states .
nato was plunged into an unprecedented crisis in february after germany , france and belgium blocked a u.s. request to help boost turkey 's defenses in preparation for a war .

german chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday renewed his criticism of the u.s.-led war in iraq and said the united nations must have a central role in any post-war reconstruction . in a major foreign policy speech to parliament , schröder also said iraq ’ s territorial integrity must be guaranteed and its natural resources need to be controlled by the iraqi people . “ the united nations will be indispensable for the reconstruction process , ” schröder said .
“ because reconstruction is more than just the repair of buildings , oil fields and infrastructure . ” schröder ’ s speech comes as u.s. secretary of state colin powell meets his european counterparts in brussels to discuss what will be a massive effort to rebuild iraq after the war .
several european nations have expressed concern that the united states is preparing to forego a multilateral political solution after defeating the regime of iraqi president saddam hussein . the united states has not explicitly said it would install a military commander to lead iraq after the war , but washington is sure to want influence in baghdad after leading the war effort to oust hussein .
but nations such as france and germany are loath to help pay for rebuilding iraq on washington ’ s terms after opposing the war in the first place . anti-war stance remains popular schröder ’ s anti-war stance has been extremely popular in germany and in thursday ’ s speech the chancellor renewed the government ’ s commitment to its peace policies , saying only the united nations should be able to sanction the use of military force to solve international conflicts . “ we were and are convinced that there was an alternative to war .
iraq could have disarmed peacefully through international inspections , ” he said .
“ now as then , this government considers it a mistake that this path was not taken . ” angel merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats , said the anti-war stance of schröder ’ s center-left coalition was a populist move , which ended up taking pressure off iraq to work with u.n. weapons inspectors .
“ it made war more likely , rather than unlikely , ” she said . despite his rejection of the u.s.-led war , schröder said he hoped saddam hussein ’ s dictatorship would be quickly toppled and the iraqi people could take control of their affairs as soon as possible . joint e.u. peacekeepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un peacekeer helmet he also said the war presented an opportunity to press ahead with the development of a common e.u. foreign and defense policy .
schröder said a first step could be to set up a joint e.u. peacekeeping troop for u.n. operations instead of each nation sending its own contingent .
he also reiterated support for a european foreign minister . german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday mooted the idea of proceeding with joint security policy with only a small core of e.u. member states .
in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper , fischer said if a solution could not be agreed upon in a e.u.-wide treaty , then countries that were willing could move forward on their own .
he said other e.u. nations would then be able to join later on as they wished . in his speech to parliament , schröder singled out the importance of having britain on board any such initiative : “ it ’ s particularly important to me that great britain , which has been so important for driving european security and defense policy in the past , is part of this process . ” some european politicians have singled out british prime minister tony blair ’ s unwavering support for u.s. president george bush as a main cause of the rift within europe over the war in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

their conflict may continue on the administration of the country after the war as well . u.s. secretary of state colin powell , the general turned diplomat , returned to brussels on thursday to consult with opponents of the american-led war against the regime of saddam hussein about the shape of a postwar iraq .
like the war itself , questions about postwar iraq have fueled continuing trans-atlantic tension .
the european union wants the united nations to take a key role .
but officials in washington want the united states to remain in charge of running the oil-rich country if saddam is toppled , arguing it has risked the lives of its troops and spent billions of dollars to prepare iraq for representative government .
powell , in his strongest comments on the subject , said last month that the united states would not cede control of iraq to the united nations , as some europeans have demanded .
during thursday 's meetings , powell called for a " partnership " with the united nations to rebuild iraq after the war , an official told reporters .
but , the official said it was too early to define exactly what role the united nations would have .
" there has to be a partnership with the u.n.
-lrb- we -rrb- ca n't say when that would all start , " he said .
role for retired general foreseen the current american plan calls for a u.s. administrator , retired lt. gen. jay garner , to run iraq in conjunction with u.s. and british forces until the united states can set up an " interim iraqi authority " with limited powers .
the powers of the interim authority would gradually increase until an independent iraqi government took over , but u.s. officials have rarely indicated how long that would take .
one senior state department official has said the military occupation could last two years .
schröder at odds again with bush in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , a leading opponent to the war , staked out a position on thursday that puts him once again at odds with the united states .
schröder said iraq 's oil and natural resources must remain under the control of the iraqi people .
" after this war , the united nations must play the central role as far as the future of iraq and the new political order is concerned .
i would warn against speculating at this point about the details of the necessary reconstruction of iraq , " he told german parliament .
the centerpiece of thursday 's negotiations was an informal two-hour lunch that brought together 23 foreign ministers .
europeans object to proposal a day before the meeting , greek foreign minister george papandreou , spelled out some of the european objections to the u.s. plans for the administration of iraq and called the concerns substantial .
" we believe that the presence of an american general in command in iraq is completely different from the existence of an iraqi government or a procedure under the united nations for a transitional period , " he said .
after thursday 's lunch , papandreou seemed conciliatory .
" we are seeing an emerging consensus on these issues , " he said .
powell planned to hold more than 20 separate and mostly closed-door meetings with european and nato foreign ministers at the alliance headquarters in brusssels .
his partners included france 's foreign minister , dominique de villepin , who helped lead the diplomatic opposition to the war .
powell was also attending a meeting of nato 's north atlantic council , the alliance 's decision-making authority , at the level of foreign ministers .
according to diplomats , powell planned to call for nato to play a military role in postwar iraq , a proposal already received coolly by anti-war european states .
nato was plunged into an unprecedented crisis in february after germany , france and belgium blocked a u.s. request to help boost turkey 's defenses in preparation for a war .

their conflict may continue on the administration of the country after the war as well . u.s. secretary of state colin powell , the general turned diplomat , returned to brussels on thursday to consult with opponents of the american-led war against the regime of saddam hussein about the shape of a postwar iraq .
like the war itself , questions about postwar iraq have fueled continuing trans-atlantic tension .
the european union wants the united nations to take a key role .
but officials in washington want the united states to remain in charge of running the oil-rich country if saddam is toppled , arguing it has risked the lives of its troops and spent billions of dollars to prepare iraq for representative government .
powell , in his strongest comments on the subject , said last month that the united states would not cede control of iraq to the united nations , as some europeans have demanded .
during thursday 's meetings , powell called for a " partnership " with the united nations to rebuild iraq after the war , an official told reporters .
but , the official said it was too early to define exactly what role the united nations would have .
" there has to be a partnership with the u.n.
-lrb- we -rrb- ca n't say when that would all start , " he said .
role for retired general foreseen the current american plan calls for a u.s. administrator , retired lt. gen. jay garner , to run iraq in conjunction with u.s. and british forces until the united states can set up an " interim iraqi authority " with limited powers .
the powers of the interim authority would gradually increase until an independent iraqi government took over , but u.s. officials have rarely indicated how long that would take .
one senior state department official has said the military occupation could last two years .
schröder at odds again with bush in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , a leading opponent to the war , staked out a position on thursday that puts him once again at odds with the united states .
schröder said iraq 's oil and natural resources must remain under the control of the iraqi people .
" after this war , the united nations must play the central role as far as the future of iraq and the new political order is concerned .
i would warn against speculating at this point about the details of the necessary reconstruction of iraq , " he told german parliament .
the centerpiece of thursday 's negotiations was an informal two-hour lunch that brought together 23 foreign ministers .
europeans object to proposal a day before the meeting , greek foreign minister george papandreou , spelled out some of the european objections to the u.s. plans for the administration of iraq and called the concerns substantial .
" we believe that the presence of an american general in command in iraq is completely different from the existence of an iraqi government or a procedure under the united nations for a transitional period , " he said .

"
german chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday renewed his criticism of the u.s.-led war in iraq and said the united nations must have a central role in any post-war reconstruction . in a major foreign policy speech to parliament , schröder also said iraq ’ s territorial integrity must be guaranteed and its natural resources need to be controlled by the iraqi people . “ the united nations will be indispensable for the reconstruction process , ” schröder said .
“ because reconstruction is more than just the repair of buildings , oil fields and infrastructure . ” schröder ’ s speech comes as u.s. secretary of state colin powell meets his european counterparts in brussels to discuss what will be a massive effort to rebuild iraq after the war .
several european nations have expressed concern that the united states is preparing to forego a multilateral political solution after defeating the regime of iraqi president saddam hussein . the united states has not explicitly said it would install a military commander to lead iraq after the war , but washington is sure to want influence in baghdad after leading the war effort to oust hussein .
but nations such as france and germany are loath to help pay for rebuilding iraq on washington ’ s terms after opposing the war in the first place . anti-war stance remains popular schröder ’ s anti-war stance has been extremely popular in germany and in thursday ’ s speech the chancellor renewed the government ’ s commitment to its peace policies , saying only the united nations should be able to sanction the use of military force to solve international conflicts . “ we were and are convinced that there was an alternative to war .
iraq could have disarmed peacefully through international inspections , ” he said .
“ now as then , this government considers it a mistake that this path was not taken . ” angel merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats , said the anti-war stance of schröder ’ s center-left coalition was a populist move , which ended up taking pressure off iraq to work with u.n. weapons inspectors .
“ it made war more likely , rather than unlikely , ” she said . despite his rejection of the u.s.-led war , schröder said he hoped saddam hussein ’ s dictatorship would be quickly toppled and the iraqi people could take control of their affairs as soon as possible . joint e.u. peacekeepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un peacekeer helmet he also said the war presented an opportunity to press ahead with the development of a common e.u. foreign and defense policy .
schröder said a first step could be to set up a joint e.u. peacekeeping troop for u.n. operations instead of each nation sending its own contingent .
he also reiterated support for a european foreign minister . german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday mooted the idea of proceeding with joint security policy with only a small core of e.u. member states .
in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper , fischer said if a solution could not be agreed upon in a e.u.-wide treaty , then countries that were willing could move forward on their own .
he said other e.u. nations would then be able to join later on as they wished . in his speech to parliament , schröder singled out the importance of having britain on board any such initiative : “ it ’ s particularly important to me that great britain , which has been so important for driving european security and defense policy in the past , is part of this process . ” some european politicians have singled out british prime minister tony blair ’ s unwavering support for u.s. president george bush as a main cause of the rift within europe over the war in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
german chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday renewed his criticism of the u.s.-led war in iraq and said the united nations must have a central role in any post-war reconstruction . in a major foreign policy speech to parliament , schröder also said iraq ’ s territorial integrity must be guaranteed and its natural resources need to be controlled by the iraqi people . “ the united nations will be indispensable for the reconstruction process , ” schröder said .
“ because reconstruction is more than just the repair of buildings , oil fields and infrastructure . ” schröder ’ s speech comes as u.s. secretary of state colin powell meets his european counterparts in brussels to discuss what will be a massive effort to rebuild iraq after the war .
several european nations have expressed concern that the united states is preparing to forego a multilateral political solution after defeating the regime of iraqi president saddam hussein . the united states has not explicitly said it would install a military commander to lead iraq after the war , but washington is sure to want influence in baghdad after leading the war effort to oust hussein .
but nations such as france and germany are loath to help pay for rebuilding iraq on washington ’ s terms after opposing the war in the first place . anti-war stance remains popular schröder ’ s anti-war stance has been extremely popular in germany and in thursday ’ s speech the chancellor renewed the government ’ s commitment to its peace policies , saying only the united nations should be able to sanction the use of military force to solve international conflicts . “ we were and are convinced that there was an alternative to war .
iraq could have disarmed peacefully through international inspections , ” he said .
“ now as then , this government considers it a mistake that this path was not taken . ” angel merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats , said the anti-war stance of schröder ’ s center-left coalition was a populist move , which ended up taking pressure off iraq to work with u.n. weapons inspectors .
“ it made war more likely , rather than unlikely , ” she said . despite his rejection of the u.s.-led war , schröder said he hoped saddam hussein ’ s dictatorship would be quickly toppled and the iraqi people could take control of their affairs as soon as possible . joint e.u. peacekeepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un peacekeer helmet he also said the war presented an opportunity to press ahead with the development of a common e.u. foreign and defense policy .
schröder said a first step could be to set up a joint e.u. peacekeeping troop for u.n. operations instead of each nation sending its own contingent .
he also reiterated support for a european foreign minister . german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday mooted the idea of proceeding with joint security policy with only a small core of e.u. member states .
in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper , fischer said if a solution could not be agreed upon in a e.u.-wide treaty , then countries that were willing could move forward on their own .
he said other e.u. nations would then be able to join later on as they wished . in his speech to parliament , schröder singled out the importance of having britain on board any such initiative : “ it ’ s particularly important to me that great britain , which has been so important for driving european security and defense policy in the past , is part of this process . ” some european politicians have singled out british prime minister tony blair ’ s unwavering support for u.s. president george bush as a main cause of the rift within europe over the war in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

their conflict may continue on the administration of the country after the war as well . u.s. secretary of state colin powell , the general turned diplomat , returned to brussels on thursday to consult with opponents of the american-led war against the regime of saddam hussein about the shape of a postwar iraq .
like the war itself , questions about postwar iraq have fueled continuing trans-atlantic tension .
the european union wants the united nations to take a key role .
but officials in washington want the united states to remain in charge of running the oil-rich country if saddam is toppled , arguing it has risked the lives of its troops and spent billions of dollars to prepare iraq for representative government .
powell , in his strongest comments on the subject , said last month that the united states would not cede control of iraq to the united nations , as some europeans have demanded .
during thursday 's meetings , powell called for a " partnership " with the united nations to rebuild iraq after the war , an official told reporters .
but , the official said it was too early to define exactly what role the united nations would have .
" there has to be a partnership with the u.n.
-lrb- we -rrb- ca n't say when that would all start , " he said .
role for retired general foreseen the current american plan calls for a u.s. administrator , retired lt. gen. jay garner , to run iraq in conjunction with u.s. and british forces until the united states can set up an " interim iraqi authority " with limited powers .
the powers of the interim authority would gradually increase until an independent iraqi government took over , but u.s. officials have rarely indicated how long that would take .
one senior state department official has said the military occupation could last two years .
schröder at odds again with bush in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , a leading opponent to the war , staked out a position on thursday that puts him once again at odds with the united states .
schröder said iraq 's oil and natural resources must remain under the control of the iraqi people .
" after this war , the united nations must play the central role as far as the future of iraq and the new political order is concerned .
i would warn against speculating at this point about the details of the necessary reconstruction of iraq , " he told german parliament .
the centerpiece of thursday 's negotiations was an informal two-hour lunch that brought together 23 foreign ministers .
europeans object to proposal a day before the meeting , greek foreign minister george papandreou , spelled out some of the european objections to the u.s. plans for the administration of iraq and called the concerns substantial .
" we believe that the presence of an american general in command in iraq is completely different from the existence of an iraqi government or a procedure under the united nations for a transitional period , " he said .
after thursday 's lunch , papandreou seemed conciliatory .
" we are seeing an emerging consensus on these issues , " he said .
powell planned to hold more than 20 separate and mostly closed-door meetings with european and nato foreign ministers at the alliance headquarters in brusssels .
his partners included france 's foreign minister , dominique de villepin , who helped lead the diplomatic opposition to the war .
powell was also attending a meeting of nato 's north atlantic council , the alliance 's decision-making authority , at the level of foreign ministers .
according to diplomats , powell planned to call for nato to play a military role in postwar iraq , a proposal already received coolly by anti-war european states .

their conflict may continue on the administration of the country after the war as well . u.s. secretary of state colin powell , the general turned diplomat , returned to brussels on thursday to consult with opponents of the american-led war against the regime of saddam hussein about the shape of a postwar iraq .
like the war itself , questions about postwar iraq have fueled continuing trans-atlantic tension .
the european union wants the united nations to take a key role .
but officials in washington want the united states to remain in charge of running the oil-rich country if saddam is toppled , arguing it has risked the lives of its troops and spent billions of dollars to prepare iraq for representative government .
powell , in his strongest comments on the subject , said last month that the united states would not cede control of iraq to the united nations , as some europeans have demanded .
during thursday 's meetings , powell called for a " partnership " with the united nations to rebuild iraq after the war , an official told reporters .
but , the official said it was too early to define exactly what role the united nations would have .
" there has to be a partnership with the u.n.
-lrb- we -rrb- ca n't say when that would all start , " he said .
role for retired general foreseen the current american plan calls for a u.s. administrator , retired lt. gen. jay garner , to run iraq in conjunction with u.s. and british forces until the united states can set up an " interim iraqi authority " with limited powers .
the powers of the interim authority would gradually increase until an independent iraqi government took over , but u.s. officials have rarely indicated how long that would take .
one senior state department official has said the military occupation could last two years .
schröder at odds again with bush in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , a leading opponent to the war , staked out a position on thursday that puts him once again at odds with the united states .
schröder said iraq 's oil and natural resources must remain under the control of the iraqi people .
" after this war , the united nations must play the central role as far as the future of iraq and the new political order is concerned .
i would warn against speculating at this point about the details of the necessary reconstruction of iraq , " he told german parliament .
the centerpiece of thursday 's negotiations was an informal two-hour lunch that brought together 23 foreign ministers .
europeans object to proposal a day before the meeting , greek foreign minister george papandreou , spelled out some of the european objections to the u.s. plans for the administration of iraq and called the concerns substantial .
" we believe that the presence of an american general in command in iraq is completely different from the existence of an iraqi government or a procedure under the united nations for a transitional period , " he said .
after thursday 's lunch , papandreou seemed conciliatory .
" we are seeing an emerging consensus on these issues , " he said .
powell planned to hold more than 20 separate and mostly closed-door meetings with european and nato foreign ministers at the alliance headquarters in brusssels .
his partners included france 's foreign minister , dominique de villepin , who helped lead the diplomatic opposition to the war .
powell was also attending a meeting of nato 's north atlantic council , the alliance 's decision-making authority , at the level of foreign ministers .
according to diplomats , powell planned to call for nato to play a military role in postwar iraq , a proposal already received coolly by anti-war european states .
nato was plunged into an unprecedented crisis in february after germany , france and belgium blocked a u.s. request to help boost turkey 's defenses in preparation for a war .

"
german chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday renewed his criticism of the u.s.-led war in iraq and said the united nations must have a central role in any post-war reconstruction . in a major foreign policy speech to parliament , schröder also said iraq ’ s territorial integrity must be guaranteed and its natural resources need to be controlled by the iraqi people . “ the united nations will be indispensable for the reconstruction process , ” schröder said .
“ because reconstruction is more than just the repair of buildings , oil fields and infrastructure . ” schröder ’ s speech comes as u.s. secretary of state colin powell meets his european counterparts in brussels to discuss what will be a massive effort to rebuild iraq after the war .
several european nations have expressed concern that the united states is preparing to forego a multilateral political solution after defeating the regime of iraqi president saddam hussein . the united states has not explicitly said it would install a military commander to lead iraq after the war , but washington is sure to want influence in baghdad after leading the war effort to oust hussein .
but nations such as france and germany are loath to help pay for rebuilding iraq on washington ’ s terms after opposing the war in the first place . anti-war stance remains popular schröder ’ s anti-war stance has been extremely popular in germany and in thursday ’ s speech the chancellor renewed the government ’ s commitment to its peace policies , saying only the united nations should be able to sanction the use of military force to solve international conflicts . “ we were and are convinced that there was an alternative to war .
iraq could have disarmed peacefully through international inspections , ” he said .
“ now as then , this government considers it a mistake that this path was not taken . ” angel merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats , said the anti-war stance of schröder ’ s center-left coalition was a populist move , which ended up taking pressure off iraq to work with u.n. weapons inspectors .
“ it made war more likely , rather than unlikely , ” she said . despite his rejection of the u.s.-led war , schröder said he hoped saddam hussein ’ s dictatorship would be quickly toppled and the iraqi people could take control of their affairs as soon as possible . joint e.u. peacekeepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un peacekeer helmet he also said the war presented an opportunity to press ahead with the development of a common e.u. foreign and defense policy .
schröder said a first step could be to set up a joint e.u. peacekeeping troop for u.n. operations instead of each nation sending its own contingent .
he also reiterated support for a european foreign minister . german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday mooted the idea of proceeding with joint security policy with only a small core of e.u. member states .
in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper , fischer said if a solution could not be agreed upon in a e.u.-wide treaty , then countries that were willing could move forward on their own .
he said other e.u. nations would then be able to join later on as they wished . in his speech to parliament , schröder singled out the importance of having britain on board any such initiative : “ it ’ s particularly important to me that great britain , which has been so important for driving european security and defense policy in the past , is part of this process . ” some european politicians have singled out british prime minister tony blair ’ s unwavering support for u.s. president george bush as a main cause of the rift within europe over the war in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" it 's something we need to measure day to day , week to week . the sickness is n't simple .
you ca n't say it will be cured tomorrow and then monday everything will be back to normal . " scientists from the world health organization travelled to hong kong on thursday to determine the origin and cause of the severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- .
so far , the disease has killed 80 people and infected more than 2,300 people in 18 different countries , including a 72-year-old german man who was reported on thursday to be in stable condition . as europe braces for a potentially devastating economic impact , everyone from soccer teams to trade fair organizers are on edge . trade fair bars asian exhibitors switzerland 's health authorities have barred around 400 asian exhibitors from a watch and jewelry trade fair that opened in basel on thursday . a spokesman for germany 's international hanover fair , which begins on monday , april 7 , says it has no plans to do the same .

their conflict may continue on the administration of the country after the war as well . u.s. secretary of state colin powell , the general turned diplomat , returned to brussels on thursday to consult with opponents of the american-led war against the regime of saddam hussein about the shape of a postwar iraq .
like the war itself , questions about postwar iraq have fueled continuing trans-atlantic tension .
the european union wants the united nations to take a key role .
but officials in washington want the united states to remain in charge of running the oil-rich country if saddam is toppled , arguing it has risked the lives of its troops and spent billions of dollars to prepare iraq for representative government .
powell , in his strongest comments on the subject , said last month that the united states would not cede control of iraq to the united nations , as some europeans have demanded .
during thursday 's meetings , powell called for a " partnership " with the united nations to rebuild iraq after the war , an official told reporters .
but , the official said it was too early to define exactly what role the united nations would have .
" there has to be a partnership with the u.n.
-lrb- we -rrb- ca n't say when that would all start , " he said .
role for retired general foreseen the current american plan calls for a u.s. administrator , retired lt. gen. jay garner , to run iraq in conjunction with u.s. and british forces until the united states can set up an " interim iraqi authority " with limited powers .
the powers of the interim authority would gradually increase until an independent iraqi government took over , but u.s. officials have rarely indicated how long that would take .
one senior state department official has said the military occupation could last two years .
schröder at odds again with bush in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , a leading opponent to the war , staked out a position on thursday that puts him once again at odds with the united states .
schröder said iraq 's oil and natural resources must remain under the control of the iraqi people .
" after this war , the united nations must play the central role as far as the future of iraq and the new political order is concerned .
i would warn against speculating at this point about the details of the necessary reconstruction of iraq , " he told german parliament .
the centerpiece of thursday 's negotiations was an informal two-hour lunch that brought together 23 foreign ministers .
europeans object to proposal a day before the meeting , greek foreign minister george papandreou , spelled out some of the european objections to the u.s. plans for the administration of iraq and called the concerns substantial .
" we believe that the presence of an american general in command in iraq is completely different from the existence of an iraqi government or a procedure under the united nations for a transitional period , " he said .
after thursday 's lunch , papandreou seemed conciliatory .
" we are seeing an emerging consensus on these issues , " he said .
powell planned to hold more than 20 separate and mostly closed-door meetings with european and nato foreign ministers at the alliance headquarters in brusssels .
his partners included france 's foreign minister , dominique de villepin , who helped lead the diplomatic opposition to the war .
powell was also attending a meeting of nato 's north atlantic council , the alliance 's decision-making authority , at the level of foreign ministers .
according to diplomats , powell planned to call for nato to play a military role in postwar iraq , a proposal already received coolly by anti-war european states .
nato was plunged into an unprecedented crisis in february after germany , france and belgium blocked a u.s. request to help boost turkey 's defenses in preparation for a war .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world -pipe- 03.04.2003 schröder urges u.n. role for post-war iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gerhard schröder : " there was an alternative to war . "
german chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday renewed his criticism of the u.s.-led war in iraq and said the united nations must have a central role in any post-war reconstruction . in a major foreign policy speech to parliament , schröder also said iraq ’ s territorial integrity must be guaranteed and its natural resources need to be controlled by the iraqi people . “ the united nations will be indispensable for the reconstruction process , ” schröder said .
“ because reconstruction is more than just the repair of buildings , oil fields and infrastructure . ” schröder ’ s speech comes as u.s. secretary of state colin powell meets his european counterparts in brussels to discuss what will be a massive effort to rebuild iraq after the war .
several european nations have expressed concern that the united states is preparing to forego a multilateral political solution after defeating the regime of iraqi president saddam hussein . the united states has not explicitly said it would install a military commander to lead iraq after the war , but washington is sure to want influence in baghdad after leading the war effort to oust hussein .
but nations such as france and germany are loath to help pay for rebuilding iraq on washington ’ s terms after opposing the war in the first place . anti-war stance remains popular schröder ’ s anti-war stance has been extremely popular in germany and in thursday ’ s speech the chancellor renewed the government ’ s commitment to its peace policies , saying only the united nations should be able to sanction the use of military force to solve international conflicts . “ we were and are convinced that there was an alternative to war .
iraq could have disarmed peacefully through international inspections , ” he said .
“ now as then , this government considers it a mistake that this path was not taken . ” angel merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats , said the anti-war stance of schröder ’ s center-left coalition was a populist move , which ended up taking pressure off iraq to work with u.n. weapons inspectors .
“ it made war more likely , rather than unlikely , ” she said . despite his rejection of the u.s.-led war , schröder said he hoped saddam hussein ’ s dictatorship would be quickly toppled and the iraqi people could take control of their affairs as soon as possible . joint e.u. peacekeepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un peacekeer helmet he also said the war presented an opportunity to press ahead with the development of a common e.u. foreign and defense policy .
schröder said a first step could be to set up a joint e.u. peacekeeping troop for u.n. operations instead of each nation sending its own contingent .
he also reiterated support for a european foreign minister . german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday mooted the idea of proceeding with joint security policy with only a small core of e.u. member states .
in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper , fischer said if a solution could not be agreed upon in a e.u.-wide treaty , then countries that were willing could move forward on their own .
he said other e.u. nations would then be able to join later on as they wished . in his speech to parliament , schröder singled out the importance of having britain on board any such initiative : “ it ’ s particularly important to me that great britain , which has been so important for driving european security and defense policy in the past , is part of this process . ” some european politicians have singled out british prime minister tony blair ’ s unwavering support for u.s. president george bush as a main cause of the rift within europe over the war in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

"
german chancellor gerhard schröder on thursday renewed his criticism of the u.s.-led war in iraq and said the united nations must have a central role in any post-war reconstruction . in a major foreign policy speech to parliament , schröder also said iraq ’ s territorial integrity must be guaranteed and its natural resources need to be controlled by the iraqi people . “ the united nations will be indispensable for the reconstruction process , ” schröder said .
“ because reconstruction is more than just the repair of buildings , oil fields and infrastructure . ” schröder ’ s speech comes as u.s. secretary of state colin powell meets his european counterparts in brussels to discuss what will be a massive effort to rebuild iraq after the war .
several european nations have expressed concern that the united states is preparing to forego a multilateral political solution after defeating the regime of iraqi president saddam hussein . the united states has not explicitly said it would install a military commander to lead iraq after the war , but washington is sure to want influence in baghdad after leading the war effort to oust hussein .
but nations such as france and germany are loath to help pay for rebuilding iraq on washington ’ s terms after opposing the war in the first place . anti-war stance remains popular schröder ’ s anti-war stance has been extremely popular in germany and in thursday ’ s speech the chancellor renewed the government ’ s commitment to its peace policies , saying only the united nations should be able to sanction the use of military force to solve international conflicts . “ we were and are convinced that there was an alternative to war .
iraq could have disarmed peacefully through international inspections , ” he said .
“ now as then , this government considers it a mistake that this path was not taken . ” angel merkel , leader of the opposition christian democrats , said the anti-war stance of schröder ’ s center-left coalition was a populist move , which ended up taking pressure off iraq to work with u.n. weapons inspectors .
“ it made war more likely , rather than unlikely , ” she said . despite his rejection of the u.s.-led war , schröder said he hoped saddam hussein ’ s dictatorship would be quickly toppled and the iraqi people could take control of their affairs as soon as possible . joint e.u. peacekeepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un peacekeer helmet he also said the war presented an opportunity to press ahead with the development of a common e.u. foreign and defense policy .
schröder said a first step could be to set up a joint e.u. peacekeeping troop for u.n. operations instead of each nation sending its own contingent .
he also reiterated support for a european foreign minister . german foreign minister joschka fischer on thursday mooted the idea of proceeding with joint security policy with only a small core of e.u. member states .
in an interview with the handelsblatt newspaper , fischer said if a solution could not be agreed upon in a e.u.-wide treaty , then countries that were willing could move forward on their own .
he said other e.u. nations would then be able to join later on as they wished . in his speech to parliament , schröder singled out the importance of having britain on board any such initiative : “ it ’ s particularly important to me that great britain , which has been so important for driving european security and defense policy in the past , is part of this process . ” some european politicians have singled out british prime minister tony blair ’ s unwavering support for u.s. president george bush as a main cause of the rift within europe over the war in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

he said other e.u. nations would then be able to join later on as they wished . in his speech to parliament , schröder singled out the importance of having britain on board any such initiative : “ it ’ s particularly important to me that great britain , which has been so important for driving european security and defense policy in the past , is part of this process . ” some european politicians have singled out british prime minister tony blair ’ s unwavering support for u.s. president george bush as a main cause of the rift within europe over the war in iraq . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" it 's something we need to measure day to day , week to week . the sickness is n't simple .
you ca n't say it will be cured tomorrow and then monday everything will be back to normal . " scientists from the world health organization travelled to hong kong on thursday to determine the origin and cause of the severe acute respiratory syndrome -lrb- sars -rrb- .
so far , the disease has killed 80 people and infected more than 2,300 people in 18 different countries , including a 72-year-old german man who was reported on thursday to be in stable condition . as europe braces for a potentially devastating economic impact , everyone from soccer teams to trade fair organizers are on edge . trade fair bars asian exhibitors switzerland 's health authorities have barred around 400 asian exhibitors from a watch and jewelry trade fair that opened in basel on thursday . a spokesman for germany 's international hanover fair , which begins on monday , april 7 , says it has no plans to do the same . " we survive on our worldliness , and just because there 's some sort of flu in asia , that does n't mean we 're going to bar the asians from hanover , " eberhard roloff , the hanover fair 's spokesman , told dw-world . roloff said the fair has had no cancellations from asian exhibitors .

a spokesman said that in particular business passengers have cancelled trips because of fears surrounding the virus . german flagship airline lufthansa said it was grounding additional planes rather than face the possiblity of running empty flights to asia .
günther is concerned the sars scare could do more damage to the entire travel industry than iraq ever could . " the war in iraq was predictable and in some way measurable , " günther said in an interview with dw-world .

their conflict may continue on the administration of the country after the war as well . u.s. secretary of state colin powell , the general turned diplomat , returned to brussels on thursday to consult with opponents of the american-led war against the regime of saddam hussein about the shape of a postwar iraq .
like the war itself , questions about postwar iraq have fueled continuing trans-atlantic tension .
the european union wants the united nations to take a key role .
but officials in washington want the united states to remain in charge of running the oil-rich country if saddam is toppled , arguing it has risked the lives of its troops and spent billions of dollars to prepare iraq for representative government .
powell , in his strongest comments on the subject , said last month that the united states would not cede control of iraq to the united nations , as some europeans have demanded .
during thursday 's meetings , powell called for a " partnership " with the united nations to rebuild iraq after the war , an official told reporters .
but , the official said it was too early to define exactly what role the united nations would have .
" there has to be a partnership with the u.n.
-lrb- we -rrb- ca n't say when that would all start , " he said .
role for retired general foreseen the current american plan calls for a u.s. administrator , retired lt. gen. jay garner , to run iraq in conjunction with u.s. and british forces until the united states can set up an " interim iraqi authority " with limited powers .
the powers of the interim authority would gradually increase until an independent iraqi government took over , but u.s. officials have rarely indicated how long that would take .
one senior state department official has said the military occupation could last two years .
schröder at odds again with bush in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , a leading opponent to the war , staked out a position on thursday that puts him once again at odds with the united states .
schröder said iraq 's oil and natural resources must remain under the control of the iraqi people .
" after this war , the united nations must play the central role as far as the future of iraq and the new political order is concerned .
i would warn against speculating at this point about the details of the necessary reconstruction of iraq , " he told german parliament .
the centerpiece of thursday 's negotiations was an informal two-hour lunch that brought together 23 foreign ministers .
europeans object to proposal a day before the meeting , greek foreign minister george papandreou , spelled out some of the european objections to the u.s. plans for the administration of iraq and called the concerns substantial .
" we believe that the presence of an american general in command in iraq is completely different from the existence of an iraqi government or a procedure under the united nations for a transitional period , " he said .
after thursday 's lunch , papandreou seemed conciliatory .
" we are seeing an emerging consensus on these issues , " he said .
powell planned to hold more than 20 separate and mostly closed-door meetings with european and nato foreign ministers at the alliance headquarters in brusssels .
his partners included france 's foreign minister , dominique de villepin , who helped lead the diplomatic opposition to the war .
powell was also attending a meeting of nato 's north atlantic council , the alliance 's decision-making authority , at the level of foreign ministers .
according to diplomats , powell planned to call for nato to play a military role in postwar iraq , a proposal already received coolly by anti-war european states .

their conflict may continue on the administration of the country after the war as well . u.s. secretary of state colin powell , the general turned diplomat , returned to brussels on thursday to consult with opponents of the american-led war against the regime of saddam hussein about the shape of a postwar iraq .
like the war itself , questions about postwar iraq have fueled continuing trans-atlantic tension .
the european union wants the united nations to take a key role .
but officials in washington want the united states to remain in charge of running the oil-rich country if saddam is toppled , arguing it has risked the lives of its troops and spent billions of dollars to prepare iraq for representative government .
powell , in his strongest comments on the subject , said last month that the united states would not cede control of iraq to the united nations , as some europeans have demanded .
during thursday 's meetings , powell called for a " partnership " with the united nations to rebuild iraq after the war , an official told reporters .
but , the official said it was too early to define exactly what role the united nations would have .
" there has to be a partnership with the u.n.
-lrb- we -rrb- ca n't say when that would all start , " he said .
role for retired general foreseen the current american plan calls for a u.s. administrator , retired lt. gen. jay garner , to run iraq in conjunction with u.s. and british forces until the united states can set up an " interim iraqi authority " with limited powers .
the powers of the interim authority would gradually increase until an independent iraqi government took over , but u.s. officials have rarely indicated how long that would take .
one senior state department official has said the military occupation could last two years .
schröder at odds again with bush in berlin , german chancellor gerhard schröder , a leading opponent to the war , staked out a position on thursday that puts him once again at odds with the united states .
schröder said iraq 's oil and natural resources must remain under the control of the iraqi people .
" after this war , the united nations must play the central role as far as the future of iraq and the new political order is concerned .
i would warn against speculating at this point about the details of the necessary reconstruction of iraq , " he told german parliament .
the centerpiece of thursday 's negotiations was an informal two-hour lunch that brought together 23 foreign ministers .
europeans object to proposal a day before the meeting , greek foreign minister george papandreou , spelled out some of the european objections to the u.s. plans for the administration of iraq and called the concerns substantial .
" we believe that the presence of an american general in command in iraq is completely different from the existence of an iraqi government or a procedure under the united nations for a transitional period , " he said .
