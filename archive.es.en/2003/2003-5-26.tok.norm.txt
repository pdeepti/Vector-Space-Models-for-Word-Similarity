instead of looking forward to their summer holidays after a long season , germany 's soccer clubs are now bracing themselves for an even bigger challenge - their very survival . it is inconceivable to think of germany without a top flight soccer league , producing teams of quality on par with the best in europe and the rest of the world .
but it is a nightmare scenario that is being spoken of in whispered tones that bear a heavy hint of possibility .
since the collapse of the kirchmedia empire , which cost the bundesliga over € 70 million -lrb- $ 82.8 million -rrb- in lost television revenue last season and could total a staggering € 200 million for this season , there have been muttered concerns about the financial health of the german league .
revenues from television rights were already out of control , rocketing from the equivalent of € 84.36 million in the 1995-1996 season to € 383.47 million for the 2000-2001 campaign .
the large amounts encouraged free spending among bundesliga clubs until the rights-holders filed for insolvency last year with huge losses .

nearly € 600m in debt a recent study commissioned by the dfl concludes that the bundesliga clubs as a financial collective have debts totaling € 599 million , an average of € 14.7 million per club .
the dfl has said that the only way for the league to survive and for clubs to save themselves is to reduce their costs by 20 percent for next season , meaning some will have to sell their best players to escape bankruptcy .
it has been widely reported that up to 100 players may face unemployment as clubs begin bailing to avoid sinking into the icy depths of financial ruin .

four-time german champions and this season 's german cup finalists kaiserslautern are reported to be more than € 30 million in debt and have had to sell their stadium , as well as the transfer rights for striker and world cup star miroslav klose , just to stay afloat .

instead of looking forward to their summer holidays after a long season , germany 's soccer clubs are now bracing themselves for an even bigger challenge - their very survival . it is inconceivable to think of germany without a top flight soccer league , producing teams of quality on par with the best in europe and the rest of the world .
but it is a nightmare scenario that is being spoken of in whispered tones that bear a heavy hint of possibility .
since the collapse of the kirchmedia empire , which cost the bundesliga over € 70 million -lrb- $ 82.8 million -rrb- in lost television revenue last season and could total a staggering € 200 million for this season , there have been muttered concerns about the financial health of the german league .
revenues from television rights were already out of control , rocketing from the equivalent of € 84.36 million in the 1995-1996 season to € 383.47 million for the 2000-2001 campaign .
the large amounts encouraged free spending among bundesliga clubs until the rights-holders filed for insolvency last year with huge losses .
now things have become even more serious as warnings of a gloomy future begin to emanate from the bundesliga 's ruling power , the german football league association -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
nearly € 600m in debt a recent study commissioned by the dfl concludes that the bundesliga clubs as a financial collective have debts totaling € 599 million , an average of € 14.7 million per club .
the dfl has said that the only way for the league to survive and for clubs to save themselves is to reduce their costs by 20 percent for next season , meaning some will have to sell their best players to escape bankruptcy .
it has been widely reported that up to 100 players may face unemployment as clubs begin bailing to avoid sinking into the icy depths of financial ruin .

four-time german champions and this season 's german cup finalists kaiserslautern are reported to be more than € 30 million in debt and have had to sell their stadium , as well as the transfer rights for striker and world cup star miroslav klose , just to stay afloat .
" it will not help to save € 4000 on sandwiches and by telling the guys to bring their own toilet paper and making sure we turn the lights off at 5 o 'clock as long as the number 28 in our squad still earns € 1 million , " club chairman rene jäggi told reuters in an interview earlier this month .
no huge transfers this summer it 's not only the clubs that annually fight for top-flight status who are in trouble .
newly crowned champions bayern munich have been told by their creditors that there will be little money for plundering the transfer market as they prepare to do battle against the continent 's elite in the european champions league next season .

two historic cities and the rhine valley in germany have been added to unesco ’ s world cultural heritage list .
business owners near the chosen sites are hoping for a new influx of tourists . legend has it that lorelei , a beautiful young damsel with blonde hair , once lured sailors on the river rhine into the deadly cliffs that run along it as she sang from a plateau high above the water .
the region around the rock where lorelei allegedly sat has taken its place alongside the pyramids of gizeh and the grand canyon as a member of unesco ’ s world cultural heritage list .
last year the 21 members of unesco ’ s committee added the entire upper middle rhine valley , including the lorelei , countless wineyards and many picturesque castles , to the cannon of protected sites at its annual convention in budapest .
this week two german town centers join the elite listing : the well-preserved medieval centers of stralsund and wismar , both on the baltic sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco has maintained its list of cultural and natural world treasures since 1972 .
so far there are 730 sites in 125 countries , 27 in germany alone .
medieval architecture and luscious valleys the two coastal towns in the region of mecklenburg western-pomerania , convinced the committee with their authentic medieval centers , still replete with historic buildings , streets and plazas .
both traditional sea-trading towns have harbors built after conventions of the hanse trading union , which during its 15th-century heyday linked 160 towns in germany , england and norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old market square in wismar “ both towns are ideally developed hanse cities from the 14th century , ” according to a unesco statement .
the luscious rhine valley added as a “ cultural landscape of great diversity and beauty . ”
what ’ s in it for us ?
for the german sites , making the list mainly means an increase in prestige .
“ many people think that we ’ ll now be getting millions of euros , but the nomination has only symbolic value , ” peter koslik , press spokesman of the town of stralsund , told dw-world .
only poor countries are eligible to receive money from the annual $ 4 million -lrb- 4,028,000 euro -rrb- world heritage fond .
membership has its privileges nevertheless , officials are enthusiastic .
“ this will put us in the global spotlight and give the town an enourmous boost , ” koslik said .
the nomination may also attract new flocks of global travelers , at least that 's what the city 's businesses are hoping .
“ tourism may finally become a real economic factor for our town , ” said the stralsund official .
if all goes well , the coastal resort town may be able to compete with the bavarian tourist-magnet rothenburg on the tauber in attracting visitors from japan and the united states .
managers of castle hotels on the rhine river are also expecting increased numbers of guests .
“ being made part of the world heritage list is a great success and will positively affect business , ” gerd ripp , manager of schloss villa rheinfels in the town of st. goar , told dw-world .
“ it is also a great responsibility , since we 'll have to work harder to please our guests , ” ripp said .
currently the hotel manager is planning a 12 million euro renovation to his the medieval castle overlooking the lorelei valley .
for others , the nomination has been long overdue .

two historic cities and the rhine valley in germany have been added to unesco ’ s world cultural heritage list .
business owners near the chosen sites are hoping for a new influx of tourists . legend has it that lorelei , a beautiful young damsel with blonde hair , once lured sailors on the river rhine into the deadly cliffs that run along it as she sang from a plateau high above the water .
the region around the rock where lorelei allegedly sat has taken its place alongside the pyramids of gizeh and the grand canyon as a member of unesco ’ s world cultural heritage list .
last year the 21 members of unesco ’ s committee added the entire upper middle rhine valley , including the lorelei , countless wineyards and many picturesque castles , to the cannon of protected sites at its annual convention in budapest .
this week two german town centers join the elite listing : the well-preserved medieval centers of stralsund and wismar , both on the baltic sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco has maintained its list of cultural and natural world treasures since 1972 .

membership has its privileges nevertheless , officials are enthusiastic .
“ this will put us in the global spotlight and give the town an enourmous boost , ” koslik said .
the nomination may also attract new flocks of global travelers , at least that 's what the city 's businesses are hoping .
“ tourism may finally become a real economic factor for our town , ” said the stralsund official .

two historic cities and the rhine valley in germany have been added to unesco ’ s world cultural heritage list .
business owners near the chosen sites are hoping for a new influx of tourists . legend has it that lorelei , a beautiful young damsel with blonde hair , once lured sailors on the river rhine into the deadly cliffs that run along it as she sang from a plateau high above the water .
the region around the rock where lorelei allegedly sat has taken its place alongside the pyramids of gizeh and the grand canyon as a member of unesco ’ s world cultural heritage list .
last year the 21 members of unesco ’ s committee added the entire upper middle rhine valley , including the lorelei , countless wineyards and many picturesque castles , to the cannon of protected sites at its annual convention in budapest .
this week two german town centers join the elite listing : the well-preserved medieval centers of stralsund and wismar , both on the baltic sea .

what ’ s in it for us ?
for the german sites , making the list mainly means an increase in prestige .
“ many people think that we ’ ll now be getting millions of euros , but the nomination has only symbolic value , ” peter koslik , press spokesman of the town of stralsund , told dw-world .
only poor countries are eligible to receive money from the annual $ 4 million -lrb- 4,028,000 euro -rrb- world heritage fond .
membership has its privileges nevertheless , officials are enthusiastic .
“ this will put us in the global spotlight and give the town an enourmous boost , ” koslik said .
the nomination may also attract new flocks of global travelers , at least that 's what the city 's businesses are hoping .
“ tourism may finally become a real economic factor for our town , ” said the stralsund official .
if all goes well , the coastal resort town may be able to compete with the bavarian tourist-magnet rothenburg on the tauber in attracting visitors from japan and the united states .

“ it is also a great responsibility , since we 'll have to work harder to please our guests , ” ripp said .
currently the hotel manager is planning a 12 million euro renovation to his the medieval castle overlooking the lorelei valley .

instead of looking forward to their summer holidays after a long season , germany 's soccer clubs are now bracing themselves for an even bigger challenge - their very survival . it is inconceivable to think of germany without a top flight soccer league , producing teams of quality on par with the best in europe and the rest of the world .
but it is a nightmare scenario that is being spoken of in whispered tones that bear a heavy hint of possibility .
since the collapse of the kirchmedia empire , which cost the bundesliga over € 70 million -lrb- $ 82.8 million -rrb- in lost television revenue last season and could total a staggering € 200 million for this season , there have been muttered concerns about the financial health of the german league .
revenues from television rights were already out of control , rocketing from the equivalent of € 84.36 million in the 1995-1996 season to € 383.47 million for the 2000-2001 campaign .
the large amounts encouraged free spending among bundesliga clubs until the rights-holders filed for insolvency last year with huge losses .
now things have become even more serious as warnings of a gloomy future begin to emanate from the bundesliga 's ruling power , the german football league association -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
nearly € 600m in debt a recent study commissioned by the dfl concludes that the bundesliga clubs as a financial collective have debts totaling € 599 million , an average of € 14.7 million per club .
the dfl has said that the only way for the league to survive and for clubs to save themselves is to reduce their costs by 20 percent for next season , meaning some will have to sell their best players to escape bankruptcy .
it has been widely reported that up to 100 players may face unemployment as clubs begin bailing to avoid sinking into the icy depths of financial ruin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lautern 's stadium has gone ... will klose -lrb- l . -rrb- be next ?
four-time german champions and this season 's german cup finalists kaiserslautern are reported to be more than € 30 million in debt and have had to sell their stadium , as well as the transfer rights for striker and world cup star miroslav klose , just to stay afloat .
" it will not help to save € 4000 on sandwiches and by telling the guys to bring their own toilet paper and making sure we turn the lights off at 5 o 'clock as long as the number 28 in our squad still earns € 1 million , " club chairman rene jäggi told reuters in an interview earlier this month .
no huge transfers this summer it 's not only the clubs that annually fight for top-flight status who are in trouble .
newly crowned champions bayern munich have been told by their creditors that there will be little money for plundering the transfer market as they prepare to do battle against the continent 's elite in the european champions league next season .
" there 's only one area in which you can really save money and that 's the salaries , " bayern commercial manager uli hoeness said .
" you can forget about the rest . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : real madrid attracted both ronaldo , right , and zinedine zidane .
unable to attract top drawer players to the bundesliga , the cycle of dwindling funds may get worse with clubs from the more affluent leagues such as spain 's la liga , the italian serie a and the english premiership vying for the world 's talent .
with a core of international clubs securing the signatures of the world 's best players , in effect speculating to accumulate , the money-spinning competitions and lucrative sponsorship deals that go along with that success will be dominated by those who can assemble the most glittering talent .
as the past season has shown , failure to make an impact in the champions league severely tightens the purse strings .
for the first time since the 1956-57 season , there was no german representative in the last eight of any european competition .
threat of license withdrawal back on the domestic front , if the message was n't clear enough , the dfl has employed shock tactics to alert the league clubs to the bleak scenario of a possible bundesliga collapse .
the governing body has warned 24 of the 36 professional clubs that it will not renew their licenses to take part in the league until they have sorted out their finances .
the television situation is also likely to worsen with infront , the swiss marketing agency which currently owns the rights , trying to sell its concern to free television companies .
infront has its own financial problems and may not be able to pay its way in future seasons .
the central marketing deal , which ensures that all clubs benefit from the television money , is also causing problems .
bayern munich have threatened to tear up the solidarity pact that benefits all clubs by striking television deals on their own from next year .
if the champions succeed , the deal could collapse leading to the financial death of less attractive clubs . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hard times for european soccer soccer may be as popular as ever in europe , especially in the aftermath of the world cup .

instead of looking forward to their summer holidays after a long season , germany 's soccer clubs are now bracing themselves for an even bigger challenge - their very survival . it is inconceivable to think of germany without a top flight soccer league , producing teams of quality on par with the best in europe and the rest of the world .
but it is a nightmare scenario that is being spoken of in whispered tones that bear a heavy hint of possibility .
since the collapse of the kirchmedia empire , which cost the bundesliga over € 70 million -lrb- $ 82.8 million -rrb- in lost television revenue last season and could total a staggering € 200 million for this season , there have been muttered concerns about the financial health of the german league .
revenues from television rights were already out of control , rocketing from the equivalent of € 84.36 million in the 1995-1996 season to € 383.47 million for the 2000-2001 campaign .
the large amounts encouraged free spending among bundesliga clubs until the rights-holders filed for insolvency last year with huge losses .

nearly € 600m in debt a recent study commissioned by the dfl concludes that the bundesliga clubs as a financial collective have debts totaling € 599 million , an average of € 14.7 million per club .
the dfl has said that the only way for the league to survive and for clubs to save themselves is to reduce their costs by 20 percent for next season , meaning some will have to sell their best players to escape bankruptcy .
it has been widely reported that up to 100 players may face unemployment as clubs begin bailing to avoid sinking into the icy depths of financial ruin .

instead of looking forward to their summer holidays after a long season , germany 's soccer clubs are now bracing themselves for an even bigger challenge - their very survival . it is inconceivable to think of germany without a top flight soccer league , producing teams of quality on par with the best in europe and the rest of the world .
but it is a nightmare scenario that is being spoken of in whispered tones that bear a heavy hint of possibility .
since the collapse of the kirchmedia empire , which cost the bundesliga over € 70 million -lrb- $ 82.8 million -rrb- in lost television revenue last season and could total a staggering € 200 million for this season , there have been muttered concerns about the financial health of the german league .
revenues from television rights were already out of control , rocketing from the equivalent of € 84.36 million in the 1995-1996 season to € 383.47 million for the 2000-2001 campaign .
the large amounts encouraged free spending among bundesliga clubs until the rights-holders filed for insolvency last year with huge losses .

nearly € 600m in debt a recent study commissioned by the dfl concludes that the bundesliga clubs as a financial collective have debts totaling € 599 million , an average of € 14.7 million per club .
the dfl has said that the only way for the league to survive and for clubs to save themselves is to reduce their costs by 20 percent for next season , meaning some will have to sell their best players to escape bankruptcy .
it has been widely reported that up to 100 players may face unemployment as clubs begin bailing to avoid sinking into the icy depths of financial ruin .

instead of looking forward to their summer holidays after a long season , germany 's soccer clubs are now bracing themselves for an even bigger challenge - their very survival . it is inconceivable to think of germany without a top flight soccer league , producing teams of quality on par with the best in europe and the rest of the world .

instead of looking forward to their summer holidays after a long season , germany 's soccer clubs are now bracing themselves for an even bigger challenge - their very survival . it is inconceivable to think of germany without a top flight soccer league , producing teams of quality on par with the best in europe and the rest of the world .
but it is a nightmare scenario that is being spoken of in whispered tones that bear a heavy hint of possibility .
since the collapse of the kirchmedia empire , which cost the bundesliga over € 70 million -lrb- $ 82.8 million -rrb- in lost television revenue last season and could total a staggering € 200 million for this season , there have been muttered concerns about the financial health of the german league .
revenues from television rights were already out of control , rocketing from the equivalent of € 84.36 million in the 1995-1996 season to € 383.47 million for the 2000-2001 campaign .
the large amounts encouraged free spending among bundesliga clubs until the rights-holders filed for insolvency last year with huge losses .

nearly € 600m in debt a recent study commissioned by the dfl concludes that the bundesliga clubs as a financial collective have debts totaling € 599 million , an average of € 14.7 million per club .
the dfl has said that the only way for the league to survive and for clubs to save themselves is to reduce their costs by 20 percent for next season , meaning some will have to sell their best players to escape bankruptcy .
it has been widely reported that up to 100 players may face unemployment as clubs begin bailing to avoid sinking into the icy depths of financial ruin .

instead of looking forward to their summer holidays after a long season , germany 's soccer clubs are now bracing themselves for an even bigger challenge - their very survival . it is inconceivable to think of germany without a top flight soccer league , producing teams of quality on par with the best in europe and the rest of the world .
but it is a nightmare scenario that is being spoken of in whispered tones that bear a heavy hint of possibility .
since the collapse of the kirchmedia empire , which cost the bundesliga over € 70 million -lrb- $ 82.8 million -rrb- in lost television revenue last season and could total a staggering € 200 million for this season , there have been muttered concerns about the financial health of the german league .
revenues from television rights were already out of control , rocketing from the equivalent of € 84.36 million in the 1995-1996 season to € 383.47 million for the 2000-2001 campaign .
the large amounts encouraged free spending among bundesliga clubs until the rights-holders filed for insolvency last year with huge losses .
now things have become even more serious as warnings of a gloomy future begin to emanate from the bundesliga 's ruling power , the german football league association -lrb- dfl -rrb- .
nearly € 600m in debt a recent study commissioned by the dfl concludes that the bundesliga clubs as a financial collective have debts totaling € 599 million , an average of € 14.7 million per club .
the dfl has said that the only way for the league to survive and for clubs to save themselves is to reduce their costs by 20 percent for next season , meaning some will have to sell their best players to escape bankruptcy .
it has been widely reported that up to 100 players may face unemployment as clubs begin bailing to avoid sinking into the icy depths of financial ruin .

four-time german champions and this season 's german cup finalists kaiserslautern are reported to be more than € 30 million in debt and have had to sell their stadium , as well as the transfer rights for striker and world cup star miroslav klose , just to stay afloat .
" it will not help to save € 4000 on sandwiches and by telling the guys to bring their own toilet paper and making sure we turn the lights off at 5 o 'clock as long as the number 28 in our squad still earns € 1 million , " club chairman rene jäggi told reuters in an interview earlier this month .

two historic cities and the rhine valley in germany have been added to unesco ’ s world cultural heritage list .
business owners near the chosen sites are hoping for a new influx of tourists . legend has it that lorelei , a beautiful young damsel with blonde hair , once lured sailors on the river rhine into the deadly cliffs that run along it as she sang from a plateau high above the water .
the region around the rock where lorelei allegedly sat has taken its place alongside the pyramids of gizeh and the grand canyon as a member of unesco ’ s world cultural heritage list .
last year the 21 members of unesco ’ s committee added the entire upper middle rhine valley , including the lorelei , countless wineyards and many picturesque castles , to the cannon of protected sites at its annual convention in budapest .
this week two german town centers join the elite listing : the well-preserved medieval centers of stralsund and wismar , both on the baltic sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco has maintained its list of cultural and natural world treasures since 1972 .
so far there are 730 sites in 125 countries , 27 in germany alone .
medieval architecture and luscious valleys the two coastal towns in the region of mecklenburg western-pomerania , convinced the committee with their authentic medieval centers , still replete with historic buildings , streets and plazas .
both traditional sea-trading towns have harbors built after conventions of the hanse trading union , which during its 15th-century heyday linked 160 towns in germany , england and norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old market square in wismar “ both towns are ideally developed hanse cities from the 14th century , ” according to a unesco statement .
the luscious rhine valley added as a “ cultural landscape of great diversity and beauty . ”
what ’ s in it for us ?
for the german sites , making the list mainly means an increase in prestige .
“ many people think that we ’ ll now be getting millions of euros , but the nomination has only symbolic value , ” peter koslik , press spokesman of the town of stralsund , told dw-world .
only poor countries are eligible to receive money from the annual $ 4 million -lrb- 4,028,000 euro -rrb- world heritage fond .
membership has its privileges nevertheless , officials are enthusiastic .
“ this will put us in the global spotlight and give the town an enourmous boost , ” koslik said .
the nomination may also attract new flocks of global travelers , at least that 's what the city 's businesses are hoping .
“ tourism may finally become a real economic factor for our town , ” said the stralsund official .
if all goes well , the coastal resort town may be able to compete with the bavarian tourist-magnet rothenburg on the tauber in attracting visitors from japan and the united states .
managers of castle hotels on the rhine river are also expecting increased numbers of guests .
“ being made part of the world heritage list is a great success and will positively affect business , ” gerd ripp , manager of schloss villa rheinfels in the town of st. goar , told dw-world .
“ it is also a great responsibility , since we 'll have to work harder to please our guests , ” ripp said .
currently the hotel manager is planning a 12 million euro renovation to his the medieval castle overlooking the lorelei valley .
for others , the nomination has been long overdue .

business owners near the chosen sites are hoping for a new influx of tourists . legend has it that lorelei , a beautiful young damsel with blonde hair , once lured sailors on the river rhine into the deadly cliffs that run along it as she sang from a plateau high above the water .
the region around the rock where lorelei allegedly sat has taken its place alongside the pyramids of gizeh and the grand canyon as a member of unesco ’ s world cultural heritage list .
last year the 21 members of unesco ’ s committee added the entire upper middle rhine valley , including the lorelei , countless wineyards and many picturesque castles , to the cannon of protected sites at its annual convention in budapest .
this week two german town centers join the elite listing : the well-preserved medieval centers of stralsund and wismar , both on the baltic sea .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unesco has maintained its list of cultural and natural world treasures since 1972 .
so far there are 730 sites in 125 countries , 27 in germany alone .
medieval architecture and luscious valleys the two coastal towns in the region of mecklenburg western-pomerania , convinced the committee with their authentic medieval centers , still replete with historic buildings , streets and plazas .
both traditional sea-trading towns have harbors built after conventions of the hanse trading union , which during its 15th-century heyday linked 160 towns in germany , england and norway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : old market square in wismar “ both towns are ideally developed hanse cities from the 14th century , ” according to a unesco statement .
the luscious rhine valley added as a “ cultural landscape of great diversity and beauty . ”
what ’ s in it for us ?
for the german sites , making the list mainly means an increase in prestige .
“ many people think that we ’ ll now be getting millions of euros , but the nomination has only symbolic value , ” peter koslik , press spokesman of the town of stralsund , told dw-world .
only poor countries are eligible to receive money from the annual $ 4 million -lrb- 4,028,000 euro -rrb- world heritage fond .
membership has its privileges nevertheless , officials are enthusiastic .
“ this will put us in the global spotlight and give the town an enourmous boost , ” koslik said .
the nomination may also attract new flocks of global travelers , at least that 's what the city 's businesses are hoping .
“ tourism may finally become a real economic factor for our town , ” said the stralsund official .
if all goes well , the coastal resort town may be able to compete with the bavarian tourist-magnet rothenburg on the tauber in attracting visitors from japan and the united states .
managers of castle hotels on the rhine river are also expecting increased numbers of guests .
“ being made part of the world heritage list is a great success and will positively affect business , ” gerd ripp , manager of schloss villa rheinfels in the town of st. goar , told dw-world .
“ it is also a great responsibility , since we 'll have to work harder to please our guests , ” ripp said .
currently the hotel manager is planning a 12 million euro renovation to his the medieval castle overlooking the lorelei valley .
for others , the nomination has been long overdue .

what ’ s in it for us ?
for the german sites , making the list mainly means an increase in prestige .
“ many people think that we ’ ll now be getting millions of euros , but the nomination has only symbolic value , ” peter koslik , press spokesman of the town of stralsund , told dw-world .
only poor countries are eligible to receive money from the annual $ 4 million -lrb- 4,028,000 euro -rrb- world heritage fond .
membership has its privileges nevertheless , officials are enthusiastic .
“ this will put us in the global spotlight and give the town an enourmous boost , ” koslik said .
the nomination may also attract new flocks of global travelers , at least that 's what the city 's businesses are hoping .
“ tourism may finally become a real economic factor for our town , ” said the stralsund official .
if all goes well , the coastal resort town may be able to compete with the bavarian tourist-magnet rothenburg on the tauber in attracting visitors from japan and the united states .
managers of castle hotels on the rhine river are also expecting increased numbers of guests .
“ being made part of the world heritage list is a great success and will positively affect business , ” gerd ripp , manager of schloss villa rheinfels in the town of st. goar , told dw-world .
“ it is also a great responsibility , since we 'll have to work harder to please our guests , ” ripp said .
currently the hotel manager is planning a 12 million euro renovation to his the medieval castle overlooking the lorelei valley .
for others , the nomination has been long overdue .

the foreign secretary of the papal state , archbishop jean-louis tauran , told the italian newspaper corriere della sera there should be geographical limits to the eu .
he also called for an emphasis on sharing what he called the heritage of european values .
as work on the future european constitution advances , the vatican has been placing heavy emphasis on the eu 's christian roots .
it has had some success in that the draft agrees that the status given by national legislations to churches and religious associations , and relations with them , should be respected .
" i hope all that will be confirmed in the final version , " archbishop tauran told corriere della sera .
but the roman catholic church is less happy with the preamble , where it wants to see reference to " religious , and specially christian , heritage " in the basic text .
" even the more general mention of ' religious heritage ' would not be enough , " he said .
another senior roman catholic cleric , cardinal camillo ruini , said the eu had been posed an extremely delicate problem by the application from turkey , which he described as a deeply muslim country with a fast-growing population .
cardinal ruini , who is head of the conference of italian bishops , did however say that admitting turkey to the eu would improve the lot of its small christian minority .

the foreign secretary of the papal state , archbishop jean-louis tauran , told the italian newspaper corriere della sera there should be geographical limits to the eu .
he also called for an emphasis on sharing what he called the heritage of european values .
as work on the future european constitution advances , the vatican has been placing heavy emphasis on the eu 's christian roots .
it has had some success in that the draft agrees that the status given by national legislations to churches and religious associations , and relations with them , should be respected .
" i hope all that will be confirmed in the final version , " archbishop tauran told corriere della sera .
but the roman catholic church is less happy with the preamble , where it wants to see reference to " religious , and specially christian , heritage " in the basic text .
" even the more general mention of ' religious heritage ' would not be enough , " he said .
another senior roman catholic cleric , cardinal camillo ruini , said the eu had been posed an extremely delicate problem by the application from turkey , which he described as a deeply muslim country with a fast-growing population .
cardinal ruini , who is head of the conference of italian bishops , did however say that admitting turkey to the eu would improve the lot of its small christian minority .

norway is one of the sponsors of the peace efforts , which broke down in april when the tigers accused the government of failing to deliver on its promises .
the tamil tigers have since demanded an interim administration to be set up in northeast sri lanka for returning to the negotiating table .
but president chandrika kumaratunga has rejected the idea , saying it would amount to granting the tigers a separate state .
mr solheim is expected to meet negotiators from both sides .
on saturday , chandrika kumaratunga , a rival of prime minister ranil wickramasinghe , indicated that she would be prepared to sack his government if she felt it was making too many concessions to the group which is refusing to take part in a key donors ' meeting next month .
the government has made no promises , but ministers are thought to be keen to break the impasse and seek a conclusive end to decades of ethnic war which has left thousands dead .
sovereignty issues ms kumaratunga said she would not consider granting any interim council to the rebels until they had signed a peace deal , decommissioned their arms and renounced both terrorism and separatism .
establishing the tigers as exclusive regional rulers without their first making significant concessions to the country would be tantamount to creating a separate state , she told reporters .
" i do not think you can go into a discussion with a highly organised , ruthless , one-minded organisation like the ltte saying ' well , we 'll take what comes ' , " she said .
" perhaps it is that unpreparedness , the lack of professional handling of this issue that has led to this , and i hope it will not lead to anything further , " she said .
the president also expressed displeasure with the norwegians - who brokered the february 2002 ceasefire and who are currently trying to persuade the tigers to take part in next month 's talks .
few governments , she said , would tolerate a foreign delegation advising them to " write away their sovereignty " .
she noted that she had invited the norwegians to play a role as facilitators , but not as " mediators , arbitrators or advisers " .

mr howard was making his first public comments since mr hollingworth quit as the queen 's constitutional representative in australia .
the prime minister formally received mr hollingworth 's resignation during an hour-long meeting in the australian capital , canberra .
australian press reaction mr hollingworth had been under intense pressure over recent weeks following allegations he raped a woman 40 years ago , a claim dismissed last week by a court .
mr howard told parliament that peter hollingworth had dedicated his life to the service of the less fortunate and under-privileged .
but , he said , mr hollingworth had committed " a grave error of judgement " in failing to dismiss a paedophile priest while he was anglican archbishop of brisbane .
" he has paid an extremely high price for that , " said mr howard .
his decision to resign was correct , said mr howard , and one that put the dignity and strength of the office of governor-general above his own needs .
opposition labor leader simon crean condemned the prime minister for the delay in dealing with the issue .
" this was a person in authority ... and he failed to act .
he was guilty of moral turpitude , " mr crean told parliament .
republican cause the affair has led to calls for reform of the way the governor-general is selected and held accountable once in office .
it is the biggest scandal in the 102-year-old office of governor-general since 1975 , when incumbent sir john kerr dismissed a labor government that had failed to win parliamentary approval for public spending .
the dismissal of a government by any future governor-general is thought highly unlikely , with the position now seen as largely ceremonial .
the controversy has reinvigorated republicans who want to replace the queen with an australian president , but their cause is seen as having little chance of success under mr howard , a staunch monarchist .
