british forces are now claiming they have unhindered passage through the majority of basra after a massive assault by ground troops .
it was described as " a show of force " and not the anticipated " battle for baghdad . "
u.s. tanks rolled into the southwestern district of baghdad on saturday to engage republican guard units in the first coalition push into the iraqi capital .
when the tanks rolled in again on sunday , u.s. central command in doha , qatar , maintained that these probing attacks were not the main offensive for the city .
however , after baghdad was once again rocked by air strikes and heavy shelling in dawn raids on monday , major michael birmingham , chief public affairs officer for the u.s. 3rd infantry division , told the reuters news service that the march on baghdad was more or less under way .
" we 're attacking right down in the center of the city right now , " birmingham said .
" the other day was just an incursion .
this is for real . "
troops advance on city from all fronts more than 100 tanks and armored vehicles poured into the city at first light as a-10 " tankbuster " fighter planess pounded iraqi forces around the city center and outskirts .
the column of more than 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers forced its way through heavy resistance into central baghdad where a fierce battle erupted as republican guard divisions attempted to repel the american tanks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. troops advance through the suburbs of baghdad .
elsewhere in the city , u.s. troops were reported to be in control of saddam hussein 's main presidential palace while on the western outskirts , american forces were involved in a firefight on the banks of the tigris river .
marines were also reported to be entering the city from the southeast .
outside the city , u.s. military sources said american troops now controlled most of the major routes into baghdad .
iraq says u.s. armor " slaughtered " defiant as ever , iraqi information minister mohammed saeed al-sahaf told a press conference in central baghdad that american armored columns had been " slaughtered " and forced out of the city - as correspondents reported continued fighting not far from the conference location .
a reuters correspondent in baghdad said the iraqi information ministry and the foreign ministry were still firmly in iraqi government hands - and that heavily armed units of the iraqi republican guard had taken up positions in the area .
however , u.s. sources said american servicemembers had taken control of the city center and the heart of the iraqi government structure .
u.s. plane lands at baghdad airport the first american planes landed on sunday at baghdad 's international airport under the cover of darkness .
two c-130s and one c-117 , all military cargo planes , landed at the airport , demonstrating that the u.s. military has taken full control of it .
u.s. troops first seized the airport on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers fight for the city of basra .
in basra , iraq 's second-largest city , british military officials claimed their forces can move freely through much of the city after a major assault by thousands of troops .
by sunday evening , most of the city , with the exception of the old town , was understood to be in british hands - although sporadic fighting was ongoing .
reports breaking on monday suggest that british paratroops have now been dropped into the city 's historical center and are fighting to eliminate the last pockets of resistance .
british storm central basra acting on intelligence that the " time was right , " the british army 's 7th armored brigade , the famed desert rats , stormed the center of the city with several thousand troops and hundreds of tanks on sunday .
three units , the royal scots dragoon guards , royal fusiliers and the black watch , advanced into the city and reported only low-level resistance .
meanwhile , in the southwestern part of the city , royal marine commandos spearheaded a second wave of attacks .
" chemical ali " reported dead u.k. forces had spent about two weeks before the assault attacking targets believed to be linked to the baath party regime .
on saturday they attacked a building in which the iraqi commander general ali hassan al-majid , known as " chemical ali " , was thought to be .
british officials informed the associated press on monday that they believe a body found at the site to be that of the feared cousin of saddam hussein , the man held responsible by many for chemical attacks on the kurds in 1988 .
friendly fire elsewhere on the battlefield , military officials were investigating two separate incidents on sunday where non-iraqi targets were erroneously attacked .
the first involved the " friendly fire " bombing of a convoy of vehicles that was carrying kurdish and american soldiers as well as members of the media .
according to kurdish estimates , 18 people were killed in the strike and a further 40 were injured .
in a second incident , between four and five people were injured as the convoy in which russia 's ambassador to iraq , alexander titorenko , began to flee the country came under attack .
the u.s. has denied involvement in the shootings , which came from handheld weapons , and moscow has sent formal letters of complaint to american and iraqi officials demanding they take better care of protecting russian civilians .

anti-american or anti-bush ? europe -pipe- 07.04.2003 boycott of europe loses steam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new mini : it 's made in germany , but it 's a bestseller in the u.s. so far , the feared american boycott of german and french products has failed to materialize .
but an increasing number of europeans are shunning coke , jack daniels and other symbols of the u.s. several weeks ago , senators and members of congress in the united states raised the specter of a boycott against german products and services .
the calls came after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he would vote against any resolutions introduced at the united nations legitimizing a war against iraq .
earlier , during his re-election campaign , schröder said he was against a u.s. war against iraq and would not provide any military or financial support for one .
but anti-german sentiments in the united states have so far failed to cross over into trade relations .
in fact , sales are growing for mercedes-benz , which has seen its revenues stateside increase by 1.8 percent , and bmw , which has booked 18 percent growth - largely due to the popularity of its revamped mini .
the only exception is volkswagen , whose sales have been sluggish across the board .
arndt ellinghorst , an analyst for the german bank westlb , told dw-world that consumers purchasing durable goods , like luxury cars , tend not to be influenced by emotions .
and if the revenue figures are anything to go by , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to criticize the u.s. ' war against iraq has had little impact on german-american trade ties .
business as usual producers of consumer goods and foods have also reported business as usual , suggesting that calls for a boycott have found little resonance .
even french wines continue to fare the same , despite the trend in the u.s. to rename french foods , like the u.s. senate 's re-christening of french fries .
french wine sales have declined in recent years , but not over differences of opinion , but rather the popularity of californian and australian wines , according to the wine institute in san francisco , california .
yet , despite the deep conflict between paris and washington over the iraq war and the related calls for a boycott of french products , market share losses for french wine were lower during the first part of the year than they were in 2002 .
though there are plenty of sites out there devoted to bashing " old europe " - including www.germanystinks.com and www.francestinks.com , which have made an art of trashing european political leaders and encourage users to offer renaming suggests for foods that are too german sounding , like the hamburger - they have so far failed to influence the spending decisions of american consumers , who are still keen to drive german cars and drink german beer .
europe 's answer ironically , washington bashing sites in europe seem to be finding more resonance than their american counterparts .
a number of the sites call on consumers to boycott american products as a form of protest against president george w. bush 's war policies .
" send letters to american firms , but buy your products from european companies , " a statement on www.amerika-boykott.com reads .
the site provides links to lists of american companies and the products they sell or own in europe .
the leader of germany 's protestant church , manfred kock , has criticized calls for a boycott against u.s. and british products .
while firmly maintaining his opposition to the war , kock has said his criticism of washington 's should not be perceived as anti-american .
some members of the catholic church , however , have taken a different approach .
in a recent interview with a public broadcaster in berlin , cardinal georg sterzinsky , who leads the church in the city , said he sympathized with people who are boycotting u.s. products .
europe responds in germany , calls for such a boycott have found at least some support according to anecdotal evidence .
some restaurants have stopped serving coca cola andjack daniels whiskey .
they 've also stopped using heinz ketchup in recipes .
restaurants have also reported that more customers are asking for non-american alternatives to coke , like germany 's homegrown afri-cola .
coca cola germany has confirmed that the boycott has had some impact on its business operations .
klaus hillebrand , spokesman for coke in essen , said the company had felt the boycott in a few different areas .
" we 're a symbol for america and we have to live with these kinds of expressions of opinion , " he said .
but he also pointed out , ironically , that the people who will most suffer from a boycott are the company 's 11,000 german employees , whose jobs could be at risk if sales drop .
in germany , coke is produced by the country 's 24 domestic bottlers .

28 , 2002 .
the transport by inland cargo vessels helps to cut down costs and is more environment-friendly , as the transportation on the road usually needs some 70 trucks to move the same amount of cars .
some 260.000 cars yearly leave the ford plant in cologne by ship , some 100.000 are transported to britain by ship , which is the cheapest way to transport the cars .
-lrb- ap photo / frank augstein -rrb- the same holds true for a number of other american companies that manufacture and sell products in germany with a large local staff , including the ford motor company , which has a major manufacturing plant in cologne .
fred irwin , the head of the american chamber of commerce in frankfurt , notes that many american products are manufactured under license in germany .
thus , a boycott would do more harm to the german economy than it would to the american companies it is targeting .
for the most part , he said , there have only been isolated instances of germans boycotting u.s. products .
but there have been a few exceptions , but mostly in the small change department .
darmstadt-based bicycle-maker riese and müller has stopped purchasing parts from american companies because of its opposition to the war .
until the ban on american products , the company had purchased close to € 300,000 a year in parts from companies based in the states .
in a statement , however , the company said it would resume purchases from the u.s. if the three companies it does business with there issue public statements opposing president george w. bush 's war policies .
elusive contracts a far more pressing concern than a boycott for german and french companies is the fear of being cut out of the rebuilding effort after the war in iraq ends .
the u.s. ambassador to france in paris , howard leach , recently said contracts would be awarded " according to the rules of free market competition " and " in the best interest of the iraqis . "
but that provides little comfort for companies here , who are still smarting from the first gulf war .
in 1991 , the u.s. awarded the lion 's share of contracts to american firms despite the fact that germany provided massive financial aid during the first gulf war .

anti-american or anti-bush ? europe -pipe- 07.04.2003 boycott of europe loses steam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new mini : it 's made in germany , but it 's a bestseller in the u.s. so far , the feared american boycott of german and french products has failed to materialize .
but an increasing number of europeans are shunning coke , jack daniels and other symbols of the u.s. several weeks ago , senators and members of congress in the united states raised the specter of a boycott against german products and services .
the calls came after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he would vote against any resolutions introduced at the united nations legitimizing a war against iraq .
earlier , during his re-election campaign , schröder said he was against a u.s. war against iraq and would not provide any military or financial support for one .
but anti-german sentiments in the united states have so far failed to cross over into trade relations .
in fact , sales are growing for mercedes-benz , which has seen its revenues stateside increase by 1.8 percent , and bmw , which has booked 18 percent growth - largely due to the popularity of its revamped mini .
the only exception is volkswagen , whose sales have been sluggish across the board .
arndt ellinghorst , an analyst for the german bank westlb , told dw-world that consumers purchasing durable goods , like luxury cars , tend not to be influenced by emotions .
and if the revenue figures are anything to go by , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to criticize the u.s. ' war against iraq has had little impact on german-american trade ties .
business as usual producers of consumer goods and foods have also reported business as usual , suggesting that calls for a boycott have found little resonance .
even french wines continue to fare the same , despite the trend in the u.s. to rename french foods , like the u.s. senate 's re-christening of french fries .
french wine sales have declined in recent years , but not over differences of opinion , but rather the popularity of californian and australian wines , according to the wine institute in san francisco , california .
yet , despite the deep conflict between paris and washington over the iraq war and the related calls for a boycott of french products , market share losses for french wine were lower during the first part of the year than they were in 2002 .
though there are plenty of sites out there devoted to bashing " old europe " - including www.germanystinks.com and www.francestinks.com , which have made an art of trashing european political leaders and encourage users to offer renaming suggests for foods that are too german sounding , like the hamburger - they have so far failed to influence the spending decisions of american consumers , who are still keen to drive german cars and drink german beer .
europe 's answer ironically , washington bashing sites in europe seem to be finding more resonance than their american counterparts .
a number of the sites call on consumers to boycott american products as a form of protest against president george w. bush 's war policies .
" send letters to american firms , but buy your products from european companies , " a statement on www.amerika-boykott.com reads .
the site provides links to lists of american companies and the products they sell or own in europe .
the leader of germany 's protestant church , manfred kock , has criticized calls for a boycott against u.s. and british products .
while firmly maintaining his opposition to the war , kock has said his criticism of washington 's should not be perceived as anti-american .
some members of the catholic church , however , have taken a different approach .
in a recent interview with a public broadcaster in berlin , cardinal georg sterzinsky , who leads the church in the city , said he sympathized with people who are boycotting u.s. products .
europe responds in germany , calls for such a boycott have found at least some support according to anecdotal evidence .
some restaurants have stopped serving coca cola andjack daniels whiskey .
they 've also stopped using heinz ketchup in recipes .
restaurants have also reported that more customers are asking for non-american alternatives to coke , like germany 's homegrown afri-cola .
coca cola germany has confirmed that the boycott has had some impact on its business operations .
klaus hillebrand , spokesman for coke in essen , said the company had felt the boycott in a few different areas .
" we 're a symbol for america and we have to live with these kinds of expressions of opinion , " he said .
but he also pointed out , ironically , that the people who will most suffer from a boycott are the company 's 11,000 german employees , whose jobs could be at risk if sales drop .
in germany , coke is produced by the country 's 24 domestic bottlers .

earlier , during his re-election campaign , schröder said he was against a u.s. war against iraq and would not provide any military or financial support for one .
but anti-german sentiments in the united states have so far failed to cross over into trade relations .
in fact , sales are growing for mercedes-benz , which has seen its revenues stateside increase by 1.8 percent , and bmw , which has booked 18 percent growth - largely due to the popularity of its revamped mini .
the only exception is volkswagen , whose sales have been sluggish across the board .
arndt ellinghorst , an analyst for the german bank westlb , told dw-world that consumers purchasing durable goods , like luxury cars , tend not to be influenced by emotions .
and if the revenue figures are anything to go by , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to criticize the u.s. ' war against iraq has had little impact on german-american trade ties .
business as usual producers of consumer goods and foods have also reported business as usual , suggesting that calls for a boycott have found little resonance .
even french wines continue to fare the same , despite the trend in the u.s. to rename french foods , like the u.s. senate 's re-christening of french fries .
french wine sales have declined in recent years , but not over differences of opinion , but rather the popularity of californian and australian wines , according to the wine institute in san francisco , california .
yet , despite the deep conflict between paris and washington over the iraq war and the related calls for a boycott of french products , market share losses for french wine were lower during the first part of the year than they were in 2002 .
though there are plenty of sites out there devoted to bashing " old europe " - including www.germanystinks.com and www.francestinks.com , which have made an art of trashing european political leaders and encourage users to offer renaming suggests for foods that are too german sounding , like the hamburger - they have so far failed to influence the spending decisions of american consumers , who are still keen to drive german cars and drink german beer .
europe 's answer ironically , washington bashing sites in europe seem to be finding more resonance than their american counterparts .
a number of the sites call on consumers to boycott american products as a form of protest against president george w. bush 's war policies .
" send letters to american firms , but buy your products from european companies , " a statement on www.amerika-boykott.com reads .
the site provides links to lists of american companies and the products they sell or own in europe .
the leader of germany 's protestant church , manfred kock , has criticized calls for a boycott against u.s. and british products .
while firmly maintaining his opposition to the war , kock has said his criticism of washington 's should not be perceived as anti-american .
some members of the catholic church , however , have taken a different approach .
in a recent interview with a public broadcaster in berlin , cardinal georg sterzinsky , who leads the church in the city , said he sympathized with people who are boycotting u.s. products .
europe responds in germany , calls for such a boycott have found at least some support according to anecdotal evidence .
some restaurants have stopped serving coca cola andjack daniels whiskey .
they 've also stopped using heinz ketchup in recipes .
restaurants have also reported that more customers are asking for non-american alternatives to coke , like germany 's homegrown afri-cola .
coca cola germany has confirmed that the boycott has had some impact on its business operations .
klaus hillebrand , spokesman for coke in essen , said the company had felt the boycott in a few different areas .
" we 're a symbol for america and we have to live with these kinds of expressions of opinion , " he said .
but he also pointed out , ironically , that the people who will most suffer from a boycott are the company 's 11,000 german employees , whose jobs could be at risk if sales drop .
in germany , coke is produced by the country 's 24 domestic bottlers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the giant inland cargo ship " barco " carries some 550 ford fiesta and ford fusion cars on board as it moves on the river rhein near cologne bound for britain , wednesday , aug .
28 , 2002 .
the transport by inland cargo vessels helps to cut down costs and is more environment-friendly , as the transportation on the road usually needs some 70 trucks to move the same amount of cars .
some 260.000 cars yearly leave the ford plant in cologne by ship , some 100.000 are transported to britain by ship , which is the cheapest way to transport the cars .
-lrb- ap photo / frank augstein -rrb- the same holds true for a number of other american companies that manufacture and sell products in germany with a large local staff , including the ford motor company , which has a major manufacturing plant in cologne .
fred irwin , the head of the american chamber of commerce in frankfurt , notes that many american products are manufactured under license in germany .
thus , a boycott would do more harm to the german economy than it would to the american companies it is targeting .
for the most part , he said , there have only been isolated instances of germans boycotting u.s. products .
but there have been a few exceptions , but mostly in the small change department .
darmstadt-based bicycle-maker riese and müller has stopped purchasing parts from american companies because of its opposition to the war .
until the ban on american products , the company had purchased close to € 300,000 a year in parts from companies based in the states .
in a statement , however , the company said it would resume purchases from the u.s. if the three companies it does business with there issue public statements opposing president george w. bush 's war policies .
elusive contracts a far more pressing concern than a boycott for german and french companies is the fear of being cut out of the rebuilding effort after the war in iraq ends .
the u.s. ambassador to france in paris , howard leach , recently said contracts would be awarded " according to the rules of free market competition " and " in the best interest of the iraqis . "
but that provides little comfort for companies here , who are still smarting from the first gulf war .
in 1991 , the u.s. awarded the lion 's share of contracts to american firms despite the fact that germany provided massive financial aid during the first gulf war .
together , germany , japan , saudi arabia and kuwait financed 80 percent of the military operation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

from different directions , american soldiers and marines attacked the iraqi capital on monday .
the fighting is taxing the limits of some of baghdad 's hospitals . u.s. marine col. b.p. mccoy , a cigar-smoking commander , was in a take-no-prisoners mood on monday as american forces pushed deep into the heart of baghdad .
" once we get in amongst them , they are dead meat , " mccoy said , between drags on his cigar .
" up until this point , they had a river between them and us .
they do n't have that any more .
we are going to go hunting on the other side , find out where these guys are and kill them . "
mccoy 's marines were one of two u.s. military forces pressing toward the center of the iraqi capital on monday .
as the marines moved in from the southeast , the army sent more than 100 tanks and armored vehicles into baghdad .
the army units raided two of iraqi leader saddam hussein 's presidential palaces , including the main symbol of his 24-year grip on power in iraq .
television viewers worldwide saw dramatic footage of u.s. troops moving on the republican palace compound in baghdad , during what commanders described as a raid but not an all-out assault to take the capital .
by monday afternoon , fighting was raging in the area of baghdad 's landmark al-rashid hotel , which has been cordoned off by iraqi fighters , according to correspondents for the afp news agency .
iraqi snipers crouched behind bridges and artillery fire rang out from almost every direction .
" iraqi forces are blocking streets all over town , and their artillery is in action , " reuters correspondent , samia nakhoul said .
" the iraqis are definitely fighting back . ”
lt. col. peter bayer of the army 's 3rd infantry division , told afp that " we 've been significantly challenged . "
earlier , bayer said u.s. troops " own " two saddam palaces in the city center and a third near the airport southwest of the capital .
from the southeast , the marines entered baghdad undeterred by the two damaged bridges on the diyala river , which runs east of the iraqi capital .
reuters correspondents near the damaged bridges said they saw u.s. tanks and armored vehicles on the western bank of the nahr diyala -lrb- a tributary of the tigris river -rrb- pounding positions of the regime-loyal special republican guard .
the marines said they used bridge-laying machines to create a new crossing alongside one of the destroyed bridges .
they said they patched up a hole on the second bridge before driving over it .
the marines said the iraqis blew large holes in the two bridges on sunday .
but the fighting was accompanied by another apparent " friendly fire " attack .
two marines died when an artillery shell punched into their armored vehicle .
mccoy said he could not confirm the cause of their deaths but said an investigation had begun .
despite the advance , a u.s. general cautioned against celebrating victory too soon .
" it 's very clear that we have n't finished our work , so we 're a long way from being able to celebrate victory , " brig. gen. vincent brooks told a briefing at central command in qatar .
" we continue to say the outcome is not in doubt , but there 's still work for us to do at this point . "
hospital overwhelmed by wounded citizens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wounded iraqi soldier is taken to the emergency room of a hospital in baghdad on friday .

casualties continued to stream in , surgeons working without breaks and anaesthetics were running low .
doctors at the kindi hospital told the reuters news agency it had taken in four dead and 176 injured in the last 24 hours .
" surgeons have been working round the clock for the past two days and most are exhausted .
conditions are terrible , " said roland huguenin-benjamin , a spokesman for the international red cross .
" you could hear very close range explosions .
the windows are rattling from the thud of explosion . "
troops enter the center of basra to the south , about 700 british and u.s. troops , guarded by tanks and helicopters , walked unopposed to the heart of iraq 's second city , basra , on monday - the first time in the 19-day-old war .
the soldiers , who sent tanks to the heart of the city for a first time on sunday after besieging the outskirts since an invasion began on march 20 , were backed by four cobra helicopters and several challenger tanks .
the mostly british troops walked to a square in the old part of the city , by a mosque with a gold and blue dome and a big picture of saddam .
some sat trying to chat with iraqi civilians .
some residents along the streets smiled at the passing troops and said in english , " very good , very good . " " we now control the majority of the city .
there are pockets of resistance in the old area , " british military spokesman capt. al lockwood said at central command headquarters .
possible site of weapons of mass destruction u.s. soldiers have discovered a site in southern iraq that could contain weapons of mass destruction , a military spokesman said monday .
other developments - u.s. freelance photographer molly bingham said on monday that she was treated well by iraqi authorities who arrested her at her baghdad hotel and held her in prison for more than a week .
bingham , along with two newsday journalists , said she was taken by seven iraqi troops from her hotel late at night .
the three were blindfolded and led to a baghdad prison where she was then questioned .
" i 've paid for worse hotel rooms in africa , " bingham said of her cell on nbc 's today show .

from different directions , american soldiers and marines attacked the iraqi capital on monday .
the fighting is taxing the limits of some of baghdad 's hospitals . u.s. marine col. b.p. mccoy , a cigar-smoking commander , was in a take-no-prisoners mood on monday as american forces pushed deep into the heart of baghdad .
" once we get in amongst them , they are dead meat , " mccoy said , between drags on his cigar .
" up until this point , they had a river between them and us .
they do n't have that any more .
we are going to go hunting on the other side , find out where these guys are and kill them . "
mccoy 's marines were one of two u.s. military forces pressing toward the center of the iraqi capital on monday .
as the marines moved in from the southeast , the army sent more than 100 tanks and armored vehicles into baghdad .
the army units raided two of iraqi leader saddam hussein 's presidential palaces , including the main symbol of his 24-year grip on power in iraq .
television viewers worldwide saw dramatic footage of u.s. troops moving on the republican palace compound in baghdad , during what commanders described as a raid but not an all-out assault to take the capital .
by monday afternoon , fighting was raging in the area of baghdad 's landmark al-rashid hotel , which has been cordoned off by iraqi fighters , according to correspondents for the afp news agency .
iraqi snipers crouched behind bridges and artillery fire rang out from almost every direction .
" iraqi forces are blocking streets all over town , and their artillery is in action , " reuters correspondent , samia nakhoul said .
" the iraqis are definitely fighting back . ”
lt. col. peter bayer of the army 's 3rd infantry division , told afp that " we 've been significantly challenged . "
earlier , bayer said u.s. troops " own " two saddam palaces in the city center and a third near the airport southwest of the capital .
from the southeast , the marines entered baghdad undeterred by the two damaged bridges on the diyala river , which runs east of the iraqi capital .
reuters correspondents near the damaged bridges said they saw u.s. tanks and armored vehicles on the western bank of the nahr diyala -lrb- a tributary of the tigris river -rrb- pounding positions of the regime-loyal special republican guard .
the marines said they used bridge-laying machines to create a new crossing alongside one of the destroyed bridges .
they said they patched up a hole on the second bridge before driving over it .
the marines said the iraqis blew large holes in the two bridges on sunday .
but the fighting was accompanied by another apparent " friendly fire " attack .
two marines died when an artillery shell punched into their armored vehicle .
mccoy said he could not confirm the cause of their deaths but said an investigation had begun .
despite the advance , a u.s. general cautioned against celebrating victory too soon .
" it 's very clear that we have n't finished our work , so we 're a long way from being able to celebrate victory , " brig. gen. vincent brooks told a briefing at central command in qatar .
" we continue to say the outcome is not in doubt , but there 's still work for us to do at this point . "

casualties continued to stream in , surgeons working without breaks and anaesthetics were running low .
doctors at the kindi hospital told the reuters news agency it had taken in four dead and 176 injured in the last 24 hours .
" surgeons have been working round the clock for the past two days and most are exhausted .
conditions are terrible , " said roland huguenin-benjamin , a spokesman for the international red cross .
" you could hear very close range explosions .
the windows are rattling from the thud of explosion . "

the soldiers , who sent tanks to the heart of the city for a first time on sunday after besieging the outskirts since an invasion began on march 20 , were backed by four cobra helicopters and several challenger tanks .
the mostly british troops walked to a square in the old part of the city , by a mosque with a gold and blue dome and a big picture of saddam .
some sat trying to chat with iraqi civilians .
some residents along the streets smiled at the passing troops and said in english , " very good , very good . " " we now control the majority of the city .
there are pockets of resistance in the old area , " british military spokesman capt. al lockwood said at central command headquarters .

from different directions , american soldiers and marines attacked the iraqi capital on monday .
the fighting is taxing the limits of some of baghdad 's hospitals . u.s. marine col. b.p. mccoy , a cigar-smoking commander , was in a take-no-prisoners mood on monday as american forces pushed deep into the heart of baghdad .
" once we get in amongst them , they are dead meat , " mccoy said , between drags on his cigar .
" up until this point , they had a river between them and us .
they do n't have that any more .
we are going to go hunting on the other side , find out where these guys are and kill them . "
mccoy 's marines were one of two u.s. military forces pressing toward the center of the iraqi capital on monday .
as the marines moved in from the southeast , the army sent more than 100 tanks and armored vehicles into baghdad .
the army units raided two of iraqi leader saddam hussein 's presidential palaces , including the main symbol of his 24-year grip on power in iraq .
television viewers worldwide saw dramatic footage of u.s. troops moving on the republican palace compound in baghdad , during what commanders described as a raid but not an all-out assault to take the capital .
by monday afternoon , fighting was raging in the area of baghdad 's landmark al-rashid hotel , which has been cordoned off by iraqi fighters , according to correspondents for the afp news agency .
iraqi snipers crouched behind bridges and artillery fire rang out from almost every direction .
" iraqi forces are blocking streets all over town , and their artillery is in action , " reuters correspondent , samia nakhoul said .
" the iraqis are definitely fighting back . ”
lt. col. peter bayer of the army 's 3rd infantry division , told afp that " we 've been significantly challenged . "
earlier , bayer said u.s. troops " own " two saddam palaces in the city center and a third near the airport southwest of the capital .
from the southeast , the marines entered baghdad undeterred by the two damaged bridges on the diyala river , which runs east of the iraqi capital .
reuters correspondents near the damaged bridges said they saw u.s. tanks and armored vehicles on the western bank of the nahr diyala -lrb- a tributary of the tigris river -rrb- pounding positions of the regime-loyal special republican guard .
the marines said they used bridge-laying machines to create a new crossing alongside one of the destroyed bridges .
they said they patched up a hole on the second bridge before driving over it .
the marines said the iraqis blew large holes in the two bridges on sunday .
but the fighting was accompanied by another apparent " friendly fire " attack .
two marines died when an artillery shell punched into their armored vehicle .
mccoy said he could not confirm the cause of their deaths but said an investigation had begun .

belgium is no longer one of the first addresses for international justice .
its parliament has decided to limit its law on crimes against humanity in a move that may keep action against democratic leaders at bay . it was an issue on which israel and the united states saw eye to eye .
belgium , under its universal jurisdiction law , was out to prosecute the current leader of israel and a former president of the united states , and neither country liked the idea at all .
israel recalled its ambassador for consultations in february because of a new ruling that threatened to prosecute prime minister ariel sharon on war-crime charges after he left office .
and u.s. secretary of state colin powell warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake after he was named last month in a lawsuit for alleged crimes committed during the 1991 persian gulf war along with former president george bush sr. and current vice president dick cheney .
" it 's a serious problem , " powell said .
" for a place that is an international center , they should be a little bit concerned about this . "
apparently , belgium 's leaders were more than a little bit concerned , and on saturday , the parliament 's senate gave final approval to restrictions on the country 's " genocide law . "
law focused on genocide the original law allowed belgian courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
the amendments restrict the law 's scope , geraldine mattioli , international justice fellow at the organization human rights watch , told dw-world on monday .
the changes give the senior prosecutor , for example , the opportunity to decide whether a complaint will be examined in belgium or referred to the country concerned if there is no tangible belgian link .
the judiciary could also send complaints to the new international criminal court .
the case , however , would be pursued in belgium if the countries involved did not have a legal system comparable to belgium 's .
" during debates the justice minister made clear that not all cases will be referred to the country concerned .
we hope that the minister will only use it in exceptional cases , " mattioli said .
but mattioli said the revision raised the possibility that the belgian government might be more susceptible to pressure to avoid trying cases in belgium .
case against israeli prime minister legal action is pending against sharon for his role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried out by a christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
belgian foreign minister louis michel has spoken out against the case and said his country is not in a position to judge sharon .
the parliament had been working on altering the law since last july .
mattioli said the effort to alter the law gained momentum after the complaint was filed on march 19 against bush senior and members of his administration , including cheney and powell .
cheney was defense secretary , and powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
the suit was filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a baghdad shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 war .
after the case was filed , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt and michel pushed to modify the law before the end of the legislative session last week .
belgian parliamentary elections are scheduled for may 18 .
final approval came saturday when the senate approved the changes in a 36-to-27 vote with five abstentions .
the approval backed an earlier vote by the house of representatives .
but verhofstadt 's liberal party had to rely on the oppositional christian democrats and the extreme right-wing vlaamse blok to push through the bill .
lawmakers from belgian 's ruling green and socialist parties voted against the amendments because they said the case against sharon should not be dropped .
the amendments will affect only cases filed after july 1 , 2002 - like the one against bush senior - and only those where the country of the accused has war crimes legislation .
belgium as a last resort belgium , though , should not be the place people go first to see crimes punished , mattioli said .
" the first place to prosecute a person should be where the crime was committed , " she said .
she also emphasized the importance of international courts of justice , from the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to the international criminal court .
" belgian law should only be used as a last resort , " mattioli said .
about 30 current or former political leaders are facing action under the belgian law .
other potential defendants include iraqi president saddam hussein , palestinian leader yassir arafat and cuban leader fidel castro .
only one case has been brought to court since the 1993 law was enacted .

belgium is no longer one of the first addresses for international justice .
its parliament has decided to limit its law on crimes against humanity in a move that may keep action against democratic leaders at bay . it was an issue on which israel and the united states saw eye to eye .
belgium , under its universal jurisdiction law , was out to prosecute the current leader of israel and a former president of the united states , and neither country liked the idea at all .
israel recalled its ambassador for consultations in february because of a new ruling that threatened to prosecute prime minister ariel sharon on war-crime charges after he left office .
and u.s. secretary of state colin powell warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake after he was named last month in a lawsuit for alleged crimes committed during the 1991 persian gulf war along with former president george bush sr. and current vice president dick cheney .
" it 's a serious problem , " powell said .
" for a place that is an international center , they should be a little bit concerned about this . "
apparently , belgium 's leaders were more than a little bit concerned , and on saturday , the parliament 's senate gave final approval to restrictions on the country 's " genocide law . "
law focused on genocide the original law allowed belgian courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
the amendments restrict the law 's scope , geraldine mattioli , international justice fellow at the organization human rights watch , told dw-world on monday .
the changes give the senior prosecutor , for example , the opportunity to decide whether a complaint will be examined in belgium or referred to the country concerned if there is no tangible belgian link .
the judiciary could also send complaints to the new international criminal court .
the case , however , would be pursued in belgium if the countries involved did not have a legal system comparable to belgium 's .
" during debates the justice minister made clear that not all cases will be referred to the country concerned .
we hope that the minister will only use it in exceptional cases , " mattioli said .
but mattioli said the revision raised the possibility that the belgian government might be more susceptible to pressure to avoid trying cases in belgium .
case against israeli prime minister legal action is pending against sharon for his role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried out by a christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
belgian foreign minister louis michel has spoken out against the case and said his country is not in a position to judge sharon .
the parliament had been working on altering the law since last july .
mattioli said the effort to alter the law gained momentum after the complaint was filed on march 19 against bush senior and members of his administration , including cheney and powell .
cheney was defense secretary , and powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
the suit was filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a baghdad shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 war .
after the case was filed , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt and michel pushed to modify the law before the end of the legislative session last week .
belgian parliamentary elections are scheduled for may 18 .
final approval came saturday when the senate approved the changes in a 36-to-27 vote with five abstentions .
the approval backed an earlier vote by the house of representatives .
but verhofstadt 's liberal party had to rely on the oppositional christian democrats and the extreme right-wing vlaamse blok to push through the bill .
lawmakers from belgian 's ruling green and socialist parties voted against the amendments because they said the case against sharon should not be dropped .
the amendments will affect only cases filed after july 1 , 2002 - like the one against bush senior - and only those where the country of the accused has war crimes legislation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 07.04.2003 bush , blair to weigh postwar administration of iraq großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time for talks : british prime minister tony blair -lrb- left -rrb- and president george w. bush are meeting monday in northern ireland .
when it came to war , british prime minister tony blair stood resolutely by the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
but when it comes to peace , blair has a different view of the future . u.s. president george w. bush on monday left washington for northern ireland , where he was to meet his chief ally , british prime minister tony blair , in an effort to bridge transatlantic differences over the united nation 's role in postwar iraq .
u.s. officials have ruled out a key political mission for the u.n. , saying washington and its allies earned that right by giving " life and blood " on the battlefield .
blair wants the united nations to play a stronger role in the postwar transition than bush envisages , an option favored by three leading european opponents of the war - france , germany and russia .
bush and blair are expected to focus on the issue of when they should declare a new iraqi government , a move that could come even before president saddam hussein is toppled or the fighting stops .
u.s. presses for interim authority anticipating impending victory , u.s. officials want to set up an iraqi interim authority quickly to deflect criticism that the united states would be in sole control of postwar iraq .
" i think the right goal is to move as quickly as we can ... to a government that is , if i could paraphrase abraham lincoln , of the iraqis , by the iraqis , for the iraqis , " deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said on sunday .
u.s. officials oppose the idea of the united nations supervising and running an interim government in iraq as it did in places like kosovo , east timor and afghanistan .
" it 's not a model we want to follow , of a sort of permanent international administration , " wolfowitz said .
the bush-blair meeting at hillsborough castle south of belfast will be the third time the two men have convened a war council in the past month .
the venue also is designed to give blair 's efforts to resuscitate the northern ireland peace process a symbolic u.s. boost .

when it came to war , british prime minister tony blair stood resolutely by the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
but when it comes to peace , blair has a different view of the future . u.s. president george w. bush on monday left washington for northern ireland , where he was to meet his chief ally , british prime minister tony blair , in an effort to bridge transatlantic differences over the united nation 's role in postwar iraq .
u.s. officials have ruled out a key political mission for the u.n. , saying washington and its allies earned that right by giving " life and blood " on the battlefield .
blair wants the united nations to play a stronger role in the postwar transition than bush envisages , an option favored by three leading european opponents of the war - france , germany and russia .
bush and blair are expected to focus on the issue of when they should declare a new iraqi government , a move that could come even before president saddam hussein is toppled or the fighting stops .
u.s. presses for interim authority anticipating impending victory , u.s. officials want to set up an iraqi interim authority quickly to deflect criticism that the united states would be in sole control of postwar iraq .
" i think the right goal is to move as quickly as we can ... to a government that is , if i could paraphrase abraham lincoln , of the iraqis , by the iraqis , for the iraqis , " deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said on sunday .
u.s. officials oppose the idea of the united nations supervising and running an interim government in iraq as it did in places like kosovo , east timor and afghanistan .
" it 's not a model we want to follow , of a sort of permanent international administration , " wolfowitz said .
the bush-blair meeting at hillsborough castle south of belfast will be the third time the two men have convened a war council in the past month .
the venue also is designed to give blair 's efforts to resuscitate the northern ireland peace process a symbolic u.s. boost .

when it came to war , british prime minister tony blair stood resolutely by the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
but when it comes to peace , blair has a different view of the future . u.s. president george w. bush on monday left washington for northern ireland , where he was to meet his chief ally , british prime minister tony blair , in an effort to bridge transatlantic differences over the united nation 's role in postwar iraq .
u.s. officials have ruled out a key political mission for the u.n. , saying washington and its allies earned that right by giving " life and blood " on the battlefield .
blair wants the united nations to play a stronger role in the postwar transition than bush envisages , an option favored by three leading european opponents of the war - france , germany and russia .
bush and blair are expected to focus on the issue of when they should declare a new iraqi government , a move that could come even before president saddam hussein is toppled or the fighting stops .
u.s. presses for interim authority anticipating impending victory , u.s. officials want to set up an iraqi interim authority quickly to deflect criticism that the united states would be in sole control of postwar iraq .
" i think the right goal is to move as quickly as we can ... to a government that is , if i could paraphrase abraham lincoln , of the iraqis , by the iraqis , for the iraqis , " deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said on sunday .
u.s. officials oppose the idea of the united nations supervising and running an interim government in iraq as it did in places like kosovo , east timor and afghanistan .
" it 's not a model we want to follow , of a sort of permanent international administration , " wolfowitz said .
the bush-blair meeting at hillsborough castle south of belfast will be the third time the two men have convened a war council in the past month .
the venue also is designed to give blair 's efforts to resuscitate the northern ireland peace process a symbolic u.s. boost .
bush will meet irish prime minister bertie ahern and hold brief talks with northern ireland leaders before returning to washington on tuesday afternoon .
leaders also will address palestinian conflict the two leaders will also tackle the conflict between israelis and palestinians in an effort to mollify arab anger over the war in iraq .
blair has been pressing for the release of the middle east peace plan known as the " road map , " which would pave the way for a palestinian state .
but u.s. officials said iraq and the postwar administration of iraq would dominate the talks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 07.04.2003 fischer arrives in israel for diplomatic mission großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli prime minister ariel sharon -lrb- left -rrb- and german foreign minister joschka fischer at a meeting in israel in may .
foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in jerusalem on monday for a three day trip to israel and the palestinian terroritories .
but his arrival has been overshadowed by a dispute with justice minister yosef lapid . israel 's justice minister cancelled a planned meeting on monday with fischer after the two failed to agree on an appropriate venue for their tete-a-tete .
lapid wanted to meet with fischer at his office in the mainly arab eastern jerusalem - the part of the city that was captured by israel in 1967 , but which the palestinians claim as their future capital .
but fischer had sought to hold the meeting in a hotel in western jerusalem .
" it is not up to germany to decide where israeli sovereignty lies , " a spokesman for lapid said , announcing the cancellation of the meeting .
a full slate during his extended trip to israel , fischer is slated to meet with an array of politicians , including his newly appointed counterpart , foreign minister silvan shalom and prime minister ariel sharon .
meetings with designated palestinian prime minister mahmud abbas and president yassir arafat are planned for wednesday .
the main topic of discussion will be the " roadmap to peace , " the plan that was hammered out and presented by the so-called quartet - consisting of the united states , russia , european union and united nations - in december .
the israeli government subsequently sent washington an array of desired changes to the plan .
the current state of the war against iraq will also be discussed .
despite monday 's diplomatic hiccup , fischer is a welcome guest in israel .
many in the region appreciate his involvement in the peace process , which many have perceived as more neutral than washington 's .
the fact that fischer is the first high-level european politician to visit the new israeli regime should be met favorably in jerusalem .
israeli leaders have made it clear that their relationship to europe needs improvement ; upon taking office weeks ago , foreign minister shalom said he wanted to give precedence to improving israel-eu ties .
a flagging peace process nonetheless , fischer 's visit to jerusalem and ramallah wo n't be easy .
at present , there is no sign that the peace process could restart in the near future .
both sides are waiting to see what happens as a result of the u.s. campaign in iraq .
some in jerusalem say that only in the war 's aftermath will israel 's view - that terror must be fought militarily , and that the palestinian territories need to undergo democratic reforms - find wide acceptance .
in addition , israelis are displeased by germany 's stance against the war in iraq .
the israeli government and a majority of the population believe that the war will benefit israel if saddam hussein is removed from office .
in the last gulf war , hussein attacked israel with rockets .
some israelis accuse the german government of opposing the war on iraq for purely economic reasons , but israeli military historian martin van crefeld sees a different motivation : " the germans were know from about 1750 to 1945 as extremely dangerous militarists .
since 1945 , ' militarism ' has become a dirty word in germany .
and i think this is magnificent .
as a person , and also as an israeli and a jew . "
however , adel mana , an arab-israeli historian and head of the jerusalem reserach institute for palestinian history , says the root of the problems in the middle east lies in the israeli occupation .
" like all occupiers and colonialists , israel is not prepared to approach the problem : to end the occupation , stop the settlement policies , and guarantee palestinian independence , ' he says .
' israel sets every possible demand on the palestinians ... on the hopes that they ca n't be met , which prevents the real problems - occupation and oppression - from being addressed . "

foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in jerusalem on monday for a three day trip to israel and the palestinian terroritories .
but his arrival has been overshadowed by a dispute with justice minister yosef lapid . israel 's justice minister cancelled a planned meeting on monday with fischer after the two failed to agree on an appropriate venue for their tete-a-tete .
lapid wanted to meet with fischer at his office in the mainly arab eastern jerusalem - the part of the city that was captured by israel in 1967 , but which the palestinians claim as their future capital .
but fischer had sought to hold the meeting in a hotel in western jerusalem .
" it is not up to germany to decide where israeli sovereignty lies , " a spokesman for lapid said , announcing the cancellation of the meeting .
a full slate during his extended trip to israel , fischer is slated to meet with an array of politicians , including his newly appointed counterpart , foreign minister silvan shalom and prime minister ariel sharon .
meetings with designated palestinian prime minister mahmud abbas and president yassir arafat are planned for wednesday .
the main topic of discussion will be the " roadmap to peace , " the plan that was hammered out and presented by the so-called quartet - consisting of the united states , russia , european union and united nations - in december .
the israeli government subsequently sent washington an array of desired changes to the plan .
the current state of the war against iraq will also be discussed .
despite monday 's diplomatic hiccup , fischer is a welcome guest in israel .
many in the region appreciate his involvement in the peace process , which many have perceived as more neutral than washington 's .
the fact that fischer is the first high-level european politician to visit the new israeli regime should be met favorably in jerusalem .
israeli leaders have made it clear that their relationship to europe needs improvement ; upon taking office weeks ago , foreign minister shalom said he wanted to give precedence to improving israel-eu ties .
a flagging peace process nonetheless , fischer 's visit to jerusalem and ramallah wo n't be easy .
at present , there is no sign that the peace process could restart in the near future .
both sides are waiting to see what happens as a result of the u.s. campaign in iraq .
some in jerusalem say that only in the war 's aftermath will israel 's view - that terror must be fought militarily , and that the palestinian territories need to undergo democratic reforms - find wide acceptance .
in addition , israelis are displeased by germany 's stance against the war in iraq .
the israeli government and a majority of the population believe that the war will benefit israel if saddam hussein is removed from office .
in the last gulf war , hussein attacked israel with rockets .
some israelis accuse the german government of opposing the war on iraq for purely economic reasons , but israeli military historian martin van crefeld sees a different motivation : " the germans were know from about 1750 to 1945 as extremely dangerous militarists .
since 1945 , ' militarism ' has become a dirty word in germany .
and i think this is magnificent .
as a person , and also as an israeli and a jew . "
however , adel mana , an arab-israeli historian and head of the jerusalem reserach institute for palestinian history , says the root of the problems in the middle east lies in the israeli occupation .
" like all occupiers and colonialists , israel is not prepared to approach the problem : to end the occupation , stop the settlement policies , and guarantee palestinian independence , ' he says .
' israel sets every possible demand on the palestinians ... on the hopes that they ca n't be met , which prevents the real problems - occupation and oppression - from being addressed . "

foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in jerusalem on monday for a three day trip to israel and the palestinian terroritories .
but his arrival has been overshadowed by a dispute with justice minister yosef lapid . israel 's justice minister cancelled a planned meeting on monday with fischer after the two failed to agree on an appropriate venue for their tete-a-tete .
lapid wanted to meet with fischer at his office in the mainly arab eastern jerusalem - the part of the city that was captured by israel in 1967 , but which the palestinians claim as their future capital .
but fischer had sought to hold the meeting in a hotel in western jerusalem .
" it is not up to germany to decide where israeli sovereignty lies , " a spokesman for lapid said , announcing the cancellation of the meeting .
a full slate during his extended trip to israel , fischer is slated to meet with an array of politicians , including his newly appointed counterpart , foreign minister silvan shalom and prime minister ariel sharon .
meetings with designated palestinian prime minister mahmud abbas and president yassir arafat are planned for wednesday .
the main topic of discussion will be the " roadmap to peace , " the plan that was hammered out and presented by the so-called quartet - consisting of the united states , russia , european union and united nations - in december .
the israeli government subsequently sent washington an array of desired changes to the plan .
the current state of the war against iraq will also be discussed .
despite monday 's diplomatic hiccup , fischer is a welcome guest in israel .
many in the region appreciate his involvement in the peace process , which many have perceived as more neutral than washington 's .
the fact that fischer is the first high-level european politician to visit the new israeli regime should be met favorably in jerusalem .
israeli leaders have made it clear that their relationship to europe needs improvement ; upon taking office weeks ago , foreign minister shalom said he wanted to give precedence to improving israel-eu ties .
a flagging peace process nonetheless , fischer 's visit to jerusalem and ramallah wo n't be easy .
at present , there is no sign that the peace process could restart in the near future .
both sides are waiting to see what happens as a result of the u.s. campaign in iraq .
some in jerusalem say that only in the war 's aftermath will israel 's view - that terror must be fought militarily , and that the palestinian territories need to undergo democratic reforms - find wide acceptance .
in addition , israelis are displeased by germany 's stance against the war in iraq .
the israeli government and a majority of the population believe that the war will benefit israel if saddam hussein is removed from office .
in the last gulf war , hussein attacked israel with rockets .
some israelis accuse the german government of opposing the war on iraq for purely economic reasons , but israeli military historian martin van crefeld sees a different motivation : " the germans were know from about 1750 to 1945 as extremely dangerous militarists .
since 1945 , ' militarism ' has become a dirty word in germany .
and i think this is magnificent .
as a person , and also as an israeli and a jew . "
however , adel mana , an arab-israeli historian and head of the jerusalem reserach institute for palestinian history , says the root of the problems in the middle east lies in the israeli occupation .
" like all occupiers and colonialists , israel is not prepared to approach the problem : to end the occupation , stop the settlement policies , and guarantee palestinian independence , ' he says .
' israel sets every possible demand on the palestinians ... on the hopes that they ca n't be met , which prevents the real problems - occupation and oppression - from being addressed . "
mana also says neither jerusalem nor washington is interested in having europe be part of a solution to the conflict .
on monday and tuesday , fischer was also scheduled to meet with israeli defense minister shaul mofaz , opposition leader amram mitzna and president moshe katsav , and to pay a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
on wednesay , a visit to palestinian parliament president abu ala is also planned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

eu finance ministers asked the dutch head of the european central bank to stay on until his designated successor can be cleared of corruption charges - or someone else can be found for the post . european central bank president wim duisenberg agreed at a summit of eu finance ministers in athens over the weekend to stay in office until a successor can be appointed . " i 'm not going to tell anyone how long i 'm going to stay , " he said . " i will be president of the ecb up to and until the day my duly appointed successor takes office , " duisenberg told reporters on saturday . duisenberg had planned to retire on his 68th birthday , july 9 , to make room for bank of france governor jean-claude trichet .
president jacques chirac demanded an agreement in the european union five years ago to shorten duisenberg 's term by three years so that a frenchman could take his place as head of the bank . a touchy situation trichet , however , has been implicated in a corruption scandal involving the state-supported bank credit lyonnais .

british forces are now claiming they have unhindered passage through the majority of basra after a massive assault by ground troops .
it was described as " a show of force " and not the anticipated " battle for baghdad . "
u.s. tanks rolled into the southwestern district of baghdad on saturday to engage republican guard units in the first coalition push into the iraqi capital .
when the tanks rolled in again on sunday , u.s. central command in doha , qatar , maintained that these probing attacks were not the main offensive for the city .
however , after baghdad was once again rocked by air strikes and heavy shelling in dawn raids on monday , major michael birmingham , chief public affairs officer for the u.s. 3rd infantry division , told the reuters news service that the march on baghdad was more or less under way .

iraq says u.s. armor " slaughtered " defiant as ever , iraqi information minister mohammed saeed al-sahaf told a press conference in central baghdad that american armored columns had been " slaughtered " and forced out of the city - as correspondents reported continued fighting not far from the conference location .
a reuters correspondent in baghdad said the iraqi information ministry and the foreign ministry were still firmly in iraqi government hands - and that heavily armed units of the iraqi republican guard had taken up positions in the area .

on saturday they attacked a building in which the iraqi commander general ali hassan al-majid , known as " chemical ali " , was thought to be .
british officials informed the associated press on monday that they believe a body found at the site to be that of the feared cousin of saddam hussein , the man held responsible by many for chemical attacks on the kurds in 1988 .
friendly fire elsewhere on the battlefield , military officials were investigating two separate incidents on sunday where non-iraqi targets were erroneously attacked .
the first involved the " friendly fire " bombing of a convoy of vehicles that was carrying kurdish and american soldiers as well as members of the media .
according to kurdish estimates , 18 people were killed in the strike and a further 40 were injured .
in a second incident , between four and five people were injured as the convoy in which russia 's ambassador to iraq , alexander titorenko , began to flee the country came under attack .
the u.s. has denied involvement in the shootings , which came from handheld weapons , and moscow has sent formal letters of complaint to american and iraqi officials demanding they take better care of protecting russian civilians .

british forces are now claiming they have unhindered passage through the majority of basra after a massive assault by ground troops .
it was described as " a show of force " and not the anticipated " battle for baghdad . "
u.s. tanks rolled into the southwestern district of baghdad on saturday to engage republican guard units in the first coalition push into the iraqi capital .
when the tanks rolled in again on sunday , u.s. central command in doha , qatar , maintained that these probing attacks were not the main offensive for the city .
however , after baghdad was once again rocked by air strikes and heavy shelling in dawn raids on monday , major michael birmingham , chief public affairs officer for the u.s. 3rd infantry division , told the reuters news service that the march on baghdad was more or less under way .
" we 're attacking right down in the center of the city right now , " birmingham said .
" the other day was just an incursion .
this is for real . "
troops advance on city from all fronts more than 100 tanks and armored vehicles poured into the city at first light as a-10 " tankbuster " fighter planess pounded iraqi forces around the city center and outskirts .
the column of more than 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers forced its way through heavy resistance into central baghdad where a fierce battle erupted as republican guard divisions attempted to repel the american tanks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. troops advance through the suburbs of baghdad .
elsewhere in the city , u.s. troops were reported to be in control of saddam hussein 's main presidential palace while on the western outskirts , american forces were involved in a firefight on the banks of the tigris river .
marines were also reported to be entering the city from the southeast .
outside the city , u.s. military sources said american troops now controlled most of the major routes into baghdad .
iraq says u.s. armor " slaughtered " defiant as ever , iraqi information minister mohammed saeed al-sahaf told a press conference in central baghdad that american armored columns had been " slaughtered " and forced out of the city - as correspondents reported continued fighting not far from the conference location .
a reuters correspondent in baghdad said the iraqi information ministry and the foreign ministry were still firmly in iraqi government hands - and that heavily armed units of the iraqi republican guard had taken up positions in the area .
however , u.s. sources said american servicemembers had taken control of the city center and the heart of the iraqi government structure .
u.s. plane lands at baghdad airport the first american planes landed on sunday at baghdad 's international airport under the cover of darkness .
two c-130s and one c-117 , all military cargo planes , landed at the airport , demonstrating that the u.s. military has taken full control of it .
u.s. troops first seized the airport on friday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british soldiers fight for the city of basra .
in basra , iraq 's second-largest city , british military officials claimed their forces can move freely through much of the city after a major assault by thousands of troops .
by sunday evening , most of the city , with the exception of the old town , was understood to be in british hands - although sporadic fighting was ongoing .
reports breaking on monday suggest that british paratroops have now been dropped into the city 's historical center and are fighting to eliminate the last pockets of resistance .
british storm central basra acting on intelligence that the " time was right , " the british army 's 7th armored brigade , the famed desert rats , stormed the center of the city with several thousand troops and hundreds of tanks on sunday .
three units , the royal scots dragoon guards , royal fusiliers and the black watch , advanced into the city and reported only low-level resistance .
meanwhile , in the southwestern part of the city , royal marine commandos spearheaded a second wave of attacks .
" chemical ali " reported dead u.k. forces had spent about two weeks before the assault attacking targets believed to be linked to the baath party regime .
on saturday they attacked a building in which the iraqi commander general ali hassan al-majid , known as " chemical ali " , was thought to be .
british officials informed the associated press on monday that they believe a body found at the site to be that of the feared cousin of saddam hussein , the man held responsible by many for chemical attacks on the kurds in 1988 .
friendly fire elsewhere on the battlefield , military officials were investigating two separate incidents on sunday where non-iraqi targets were erroneously attacked .
the first involved the " friendly fire " bombing of a convoy of vehicles that was carrying kurdish and american soldiers as well as members of the media .
according to kurdish estimates , 18 people were killed in the strike and a further 40 were injured .
in a second incident , between four and five people were injured as the convoy in which russia 's ambassador to iraq , alexander titorenko , began to flee the country came under attack .
the u.s. has denied involvement in the shootings , which came from handheld weapons , and moscow has sent formal letters of complaint to american and iraqi officials demanding they take better care of protecting russian civilians .

belgium is no longer one of the first addresses for international justice .
its parliament has decided to limit its law on crimes against humanity in a move that may keep action against democratic leaders at bay . it was an issue on which israel and the united states saw eye to eye .
belgium , under its universal jurisdiction law , was out to prosecute the current leader of israel and a former president of the united states , and neither country liked the idea at all .
israel recalled its ambassador for consultations in february because of a new ruling that threatened to prosecute prime minister ariel sharon on war-crime charges after he left office .
and u.s. secretary of state colin powell warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake after he was named last month in a lawsuit for alleged crimes committed during the 1991 persian gulf war along with former president george bush sr. and current vice president dick cheney .
" it 's a serious problem , " powell said .
" for a place that is an international center , they should be a little bit concerned about this . "
apparently , belgium 's leaders were more than a little bit concerned , and on saturday , the parliament 's senate gave final approval to restrictions on the country 's " genocide law . "
law focused on genocide the original law allowed belgian courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
the amendments restrict the law 's scope , geraldine mattioli , international justice fellow at the organization human rights watch , told dw-world on monday .
the changes give the senior prosecutor , for example , the opportunity to decide whether a complaint will be examined in belgium or referred to the country concerned if there is no tangible belgian link .
the judiciary could also send complaints to the new international criminal court .
the case , however , would be pursued in belgium if the countries involved did not have a legal system comparable to belgium 's .
" during debates the justice minister made clear that not all cases will be referred to the country concerned .
we hope that the minister will only use it in exceptional cases , " mattioli said .
but mattioli said the revision raised the possibility that the belgian government might be more susceptible to pressure to avoid trying cases in belgium .
case against israeli prime minister legal action is pending against sharon for his role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried out by a christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
belgian foreign minister louis michel has spoken out against the case and said his country is not in a position to judge sharon .
the parliament had been working on altering the law since last july .
mattioli said the effort to alter the law gained momentum after the complaint was filed on march 19 against bush senior and members of his administration , including cheney and powell .
cheney was defense secretary , and powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
the suit was filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a baghdad shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 war .
after the case was filed , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt and michel pushed to modify the law before the end of the legislative session last week .
belgian parliamentary elections are scheduled for may 18 .
final approval came saturday when the senate approved the changes in a 36-to-27 vote with five abstentions .
the approval backed an earlier vote by the house of representatives .
but verhofstadt 's liberal party had to rely on the oppositional christian democrats and the extreme right-wing vlaamse blok to push through the bill .
lawmakers from belgian 's ruling green and socialist parties voted against the amendments because they said the case against sharon should not be dropped .
the amendments will affect only cases filed after july 1 , 2002 - like the one against bush senior - and only those where the country of the accused has war crimes legislation .
belgium as a last resort belgium , though , should not be the place people go first to see crimes punished , mattioli said .
" the first place to prosecute a person should be where the crime was committed , " she said .
she also emphasized the importance of international courts of justice , from the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to the international criminal court .
" belgian law should only be used as a last resort , " mattioli said .
about 30 current or former political leaders are facing action under the belgian law .
other potential defendants include iraqi president saddam hussein , palestinian leader yassir arafat and cuban leader fidel castro .
only one case has been brought to court since the 1993 law was enacted .
four rwandans were found guilty of involvement in the 1994 genocide in the african country and were sentenced to up to 15 years in prison in june 2001 . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world war crimes court opens the international criminal court officially opened on tuesday .
but along with iraq and china , the united states is n't a party to the tribunal which intends to prosecute crimes against humanity throughout the world .

from different directions , american soldiers and marines attacked the iraqi capital on monday .
the fighting is taxing the limits of some of baghdad 's hospitals . u.s. marine col. b.p. mccoy , a cigar-smoking commander , was in a take-no-prisoners mood on monday as american forces pushed deep into the heart of baghdad .
" once we get in amongst them , they are dead meat , " mccoy said , between drags on his cigar .
" up until this point , they had a river between them and us .
they do n't have that any more .
we are going to go hunting on the other side , find out where these guys are and kill them . "
mccoy 's marines were one of two u.s. military forces pressing toward the center of the iraqi capital on monday .
as the marines moved in from the southeast , the army sent more than 100 tanks and armored vehicles into baghdad .
the army units raided two of iraqi leader saddam hussein 's presidential palaces , including the main symbol of his 24-year grip on power in iraq .
television viewers worldwide saw dramatic footage of u.s. troops moving on the republican palace compound in baghdad , during what commanders described as a raid but not an all-out assault to take the capital .
by monday afternoon , fighting was raging in the area of baghdad 's landmark al-rashid hotel , which has been cordoned off by iraqi fighters , according to correspondents for the afp news agency .
iraqi snipers crouched behind bridges and artillery fire rang out from almost every direction .
" iraqi forces are blocking streets all over town , and their artillery is in action , " reuters correspondent , samia nakhoul said .
" the iraqis are definitely fighting back . ”
lt. col. peter bayer of the army 's 3rd infantry division , told afp that " we 've been significantly challenged . "
earlier , bayer said u.s. troops " own " two saddam palaces in the city center and a third near the airport southwest of the capital .
from the southeast , the marines entered baghdad undeterred by the two damaged bridges on the diyala river , which runs east of the iraqi capital .
reuters correspondents near the damaged bridges said they saw u.s. tanks and armored vehicles on the western bank of the nahr diyala -lrb- a tributary of the tigris river -rrb- pounding positions of the regime-loyal special republican guard .
the marines said they used bridge-laying machines to create a new crossing alongside one of the destroyed bridges .
they said they patched up a hole on the second bridge before driving over it .
the marines said the iraqis blew large holes in the two bridges on sunday .
but the fighting was accompanied by another apparent " friendly fire " attack .
two marines died when an artillery shell punched into their armored vehicle .
mccoy said he could not confirm the cause of their deaths but said an investigation had begun .
despite the advance , a u.s. general cautioned against celebrating victory too soon .
" it 's very clear that we have n't finished our work , so we 're a long way from being able to celebrate victory , " brig. gen. vincent brooks told a briefing at central command in qatar .
" we continue to say the outcome is not in doubt , but there 's still work for us to do at this point . "
hospital overwhelmed by wounded citizens bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wounded iraqi soldier is taken to the emergency room of a hospital in baghdad on friday .
red cross officials found awful conditions at the only baghdad hospital they were able to reach through the fighting .
casualties continued to stream in , surgeons working without breaks and anaesthetics were running low .
doctors at the kindi hospital told the reuters news agency it had taken in four dead and 176 injured in the last 24 hours .
" surgeons have been working round the clock for the past two days and most are exhausted .
conditions are terrible , " said roland huguenin-benjamin , a spokesman for the international red cross .
" you could hear very close range explosions .
the windows are rattling from the thud of explosion . "
troops enter the center of basra to the south , about 700 british and u.s. troops , guarded by tanks and helicopters , walked unopposed to the heart of iraq 's second city , basra , on monday - the first time in the 19-day-old war .
the soldiers , who sent tanks to the heart of the city for a first time on sunday after besieging the outskirts since an invasion began on march 20 , were backed by four cobra helicopters and several challenger tanks .
the mostly british troops walked to a square in the old part of the city , by a mosque with a gold and blue dome and a big picture of saddam .
some sat trying to chat with iraqi civilians .
some residents along the streets smiled at the passing troops and said in english , " very good , very good . " " we now control the majority of the city .

belgium is no longer one of the first addresses for international justice .
its parliament has decided to limit its law on crimes against humanity in a move that may keep action against democratic leaders at bay . it was an issue on which israel and the united states saw eye to eye .
belgium , under its universal jurisdiction law , was out to prosecute the current leader of israel and a former president of the united states , and neither country liked the idea at all .
israel recalled its ambassador for consultations in february because of a new ruling that threatened to prosecute prime minister ariel sharon on war-crime charges after he left office .
and u.s. secretary of state colin powell warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake after he was named last month in a lawsuit for alleged crimes committed during the 1991 persian gulf war along with former president george bush sr. and current vice president dick cheney .
" it 's a serious problem , " powell said .
" for a place that is an international center , they should be a little bit concerned about this . "
apparently , belgium 's leaders were more than a little bit concerned , and on saturday , the parliament 's senate gave final approval to restrictions on the country 's " genocide law . "
law focused on genocide the original law allowed belgian courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
the amendments restrict the law 's scope , geraldine mattioli , international justice fellow at the organization human rights watch , told dw-world on monday .
the changes give the senior prosecutor , for example , the opportunity to decide whether a complaint will be examined in belgium or referred to the country concerned if there is no tangible belgian link .
the judiciary could also send complaints to the new international criminal court .
the case , however , would be pursued in belgium if the countries involved did not have a legal system comparable to belgium 's .
" during debates the justice minister made clear that not all cases will be referred to the country concerned .
we hope that the minister will only use it in exceptional cases , " mattioli said .
but mattioli said the revision raised the possibility that the belgian government might be more susceptible to pressure to avoid trying cases in belgium .
case against israeli prime minister legal action is pending against sharon for his role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried out by a christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
belgian foreign minister louis michel has spoken out against the case and said his country is not in a position to judge sharon .
the parliament had been working on altering the law since last july .
mattioli said the effort to alter the law gained momentum after the complaint was filed on march 19 against bush senior and members of his administration , including cheney and powell .
cheney was defense secretary , and powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
the suit was filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a baghdad shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 war .
after the case was filed , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt and michel pushed to modify the law before the end of the legislative session last week .
belgian parliamentary elections are scheduled for may 18 .
final approval came saturday when the senate approved the changes in a 36-to-27 vote with five abstentions .
the approval backed an earlier vote by the house of representatives .
but verhofstadt 's liberal party had to rely on the oppositional christian democrats and the extreme right-wing vlaamse blok to push through the bill .
lawmakers from belgian 's ruling green and socialist parties voted against the amendments because they said the case against sharon should not be dropped .
the amendments will affect only cases filed after july 1 , 2002 - like the one against bush senior - and only those where the country of the accused has war crimes legislation .
belgium as a last resort belgium , though , should not be the place people go first to see crimes punished , mattioli said .
" the first place to prosecute a person should be where the crime was committed , " she said .
she also emphasized the importance of international courts of justice , from the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to the international criminal court .
" belgian law should only be used as a last resort , " mattioli said .
about 30 current or former political leaders are facing action under the belgian law .
other potential defendants include iraqi president saddam hussein , palestinian leader yassir arafat and cuban leader fidel castro .
only one case has been brought to court since the 1993 law was enacted .

its parliament has decided to limit its law on crimes against humanity in a move that may keep action against democratic leaders at bay . it was an issue on which israel and the united states saw eye to eye .
belgium , under its universal jurisdiction law , was out to prosecute the current leader of israel and a former president of the united states , and neither country liked the idea at all .
israel recalled its ambassador for consultations in february because of a new ruling that threatened to prosecute prime minister ariel sharon on war-crime charges after he left office .
and u.s. secretary of state colin powell warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake after he was named last month in a lawsuit for alleged crimes committed during the 1991 persian gulf war along with former president george bush sr. and current vice president dick cheney .
" it 's a serious problem , " powell said .
" for a place that is an international center , they should be a little bit concerned about this . "
apparently , belgium 's leaders were more than a little bit concerned , and on saturday , the parliament 's senate gave final approval to restrictions on the country 's " genocide law . "
law focused on genocide the original law allowed belgian courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
the amendments restrict the law 's scope , geraldine mattioli , international justice fellow at the organization human rights watch , told dw-world on monday .
the changes give the senior prosecutor , for example , the opportunity to decide whether a complaint will be examined in belgium or referred to the country concerned if there is no tangible belgian link .
the judiciary could also send complaints to the new international criminal court .
the case , however , would be pursued in belgium if the countries involved did not have a legal system comparable to belgium 's .
" during debates the justice minister made clear that not all cases will be referred to the country concerned .
we hope that the minister will only use it in exceptional cases , " mattioli said .
but mattioli said the revision raised the possibility that the belgian government might be more susceptible to pressure to avoid trying cases in belgium .
case against israeli prime minister legal action is pending against sharon for his role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried out by a christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
belgian foreign minister louis michel has spoken out against the case and said his country is not in a position to judge sharon .
the parliament had been working on altering the law since last july .
mattioli said the effort to alter the law gained momentum after the complaint was filed on march 19 against bush senior and members of his administration , including cheney and powell .
cheney was defense secretary , and powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
the suit was filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a baghdad shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 war .
after the case was filed , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt and michel pushed to modify the law before the end of the legislative session last week .
belgian parliamentary elections are scheduled for may 18 .
final approval came saturday when the senate approved the changes in a 36-to-27 vote with five abstentions .
the approval backed an earlier vote by the house of representatives .
but verhofstadt 's liberal party had to rely on the oppositional christian democrats and the extreme right-wing vlaamse blok to push through the bill .
lawmakers from belgian 's ruling green and socialist parties voted against the amendments because they said the case against sharon should not be dropped .
the amendments will affect only cases filed after july 1 , 2002 - like the one against bush senior - and only those where the country of the accused has war crimes legislation .
belgium as a last resort belgium , though , should not be the place people go first to see crimes punished , mattioli said .
" the first place to prosecute a person should be where the crime was committed , " she said .
she also emphasized the importance of international courts of justice , from the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to the international criminal court .
" belgian law should only be used as a last resort , " mattioli said .
about 30 current or former political leaders are facing action under the belgian law .
other potential defendants include iraqi president saddam hussein , palestinian leader yassir arafat and cuban leader fidel castro .
only one case has been brought to court since the 1993 law was enacted .
four rwandans were found guilty of involvement in the 1994 genocide in the african country and were sentenced to up to 15 years in prison in june 2001 . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world war crimes court opens the international criminal court officially opened on tuesday .
but along with iraq and china , the united states is n't a party to the tribunal which intends to prosecute crimes against humanity throughout the world .

when it came to war , british prime minister tony blair stood resolutely by the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
but when it comes to peace , blair has a different view of the future . u.s. president george w. bush on monday left washington for northern ireland , where he was to meet his chief ally , british prime minister tony blair , in an effort to bridge transatlantic differences over the united nation 's role in postwar iraq .
u.s. officials have ruled out a key political mission for the u.n. , saying washington and its allies earned that right by giving " life and blood " on the battlefield .
blair wants the united nations to play a stronger role in the postwar transition than bush envisages , an option favored by three leading european opponents of the war - france , germany and russia .
bush and blair are expected to focus on the issue of when they should declare a new iraqi government , a move that could come even before president saddam hussein is toppled or the fighting stops .
u.s. presses for interim authority anticipating impending victory , u.s. officials want to set up an iraqi interim authority quickly to deflect criticism that the united states would be in sole control of postwar iraq .
" i think the right goal is to move as quickly as we can ... to a government that is , if i could paraphrase abraham lincoln , of the iraqis , by the iraqis , for the iraqis , " deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said on sunday .
u.s. officials oppose the idea of the united nations supervising and running an interim government in iraq as it did in places like kosovo , east timor and afghanistan .
" it 's not a model we want to follow , of a sort of permanent international administration , " wolfowitz said .
the bush-blair meeting at hillsborough castle south of belfast will be the third time the two men have convened a war council in the past month .
the venue also is designed to give blair 's efforts to resuscitate the northern ireland peace process a symbolic u.s. boost .
bush will meet irish prime minister bertie ahern and hold brief talks with northern ireland leaders before returning to washington on tuesday afternoon .
leaders also will address palestinian conflict the two leaders will also tackle the conflict between israelis and palestinians in an effort to mollify arab anger over the war in iraq .
blair has been pressing for the release of the middle east peace plan known as the " road map , " which would pave the way for a palestinian state .
but u.s. officials said iraq and the postwar administration of iraq would dominate the talks .
bush 's plan for rebuilding the country calls for a short-term u.s. civil administrator and an interim authority of iraqis now living in the country as well as prominent exiles who would lead eventually to a permanent elected government .

a u.s. official said rice had " good discussions " with defense minister sergei ivanov , foreign minister igor ivanov and the head of russia 's security council sergei rushailo .
but in what appeared as a diplomatic snub , rice did not meet russian president vladimir putin even though she was admitted into the kremlin .
u.s. officials later said that a rice-putin meeting had never been on the agenda .
russian foreign ministry officials refused to specify whether they thought the diplomats ' and journalists ' envoy was attacked by u.s. rather than iraqi troops .
" we have not received any official explanation from the either the iraqis or the americans , " ministry spokesman alexander yakovenko said in a statement .
the rice meetings come at a tense time for u.s.-russia relations , which have been strained by the iraqi war , which moscow has furiously opposed .
the u.s. government , meanwhile , recently accused russian companies of selling hardware that scrambles global positioning satellite scramblers that interfere with its precision bombs and night vision goggles to the iraqis .

when it came to war , british prime minister tony blair stood resolutely by the side of u.s. president george w. bush .
but when it comes to peace , blair has a different view of the future . u.s. president george w. bush on monday left washington for northern ireland , where he was to meet his chief ally , british prime minister tony blair , in an effort to bridge transatlantic differences over the united nation 's role in postwar iraq .
u.s. officials have ruled out a key political mission for the u.n. , saying washington and its allies earned that right by giving " life and blood " on the battlefield .
blair wants the united nations to play a stronger role in the postwar transition than bush envisages , an option favored by three leading european opponents of the war - france , germany and russia .
bush and blair are expected to focus on the issue of when they should declare a new iraqi government , a move that could come even before president saddam hussein is toppled or the fighting stops .
u.s. presses for interim authority anticipating impending victory , u.s. officials want to set up an iraqi interim authority quickly to deflect criticism that the united states would be in sole control of postwar iraq .
" i think the right goal is to move as quickly as we can ... to a government that is , if i could paraphrase abraham lincoln , of the iraqis , by the iraqis , for the iraqis , " deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz said on sunday .
u.s. officials oppose the idea of the united nations supervising and running an interim government in iraq as it did in places like kosovo , east timor and afghanistan .
" it 's not a model we want to follow , of a sort of permanent international administration , " wolfowitz said .
the bush-blair meeting at hillsborough castle south of belfast will be the third time the two men have convened a war council in the past month .
the venue also is designed to give blair 's efforts to resuscitate the northern ireland peace process a symbolic u.s. boost .

foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in jerusalem on monday for a three day trip to israel and the palestinian terroritories .
but his arrival has been overshadowed by a dispute with justice minister yosef lapid . israel 's justice minister cancelled a planned meeting on monday with fischer after the two failed to agree on an appropriate venue for their tete-a-tete .
lapid wanted to meet with fischer at his office in the mainly arab eastern jerusalem - the part of the city that was captured by israel in 1967 , but which the palestinians claim as their future capital .
but fischer had sought to hold the meeting in a hotel in western jerusalem .
" it is not up to germany to decide where israeli sovereignty lies , " a spokesman for lapid said , announcing the cancellation of the meeting .
a full slate during his extended trip to israel , fischer is slated to meet with an array of politicians , including his newly appointed counterpart , foreign minister silvan shalom and prime minister ariel sharon .
meetings with designated palestinian prime minister mahmud abbas and president yassir arafat are planned for wednesday .
the main topic of discussion will be the " roadmap to peace , " the plan that was hammered out and presented by the so-called quartet - consisting of the united states , russia , european union and united nations - in december .
the israeli government subsequently sent washington an array of desired changes to the plan .
the current state of the war against iraq will also be discussed .
despite monday 's diplomatic hiccup , fischer is a welcome guest in israel .
many in the region appreciate his involvement in the peace process , which many have perceived as more neutral than washington 's .
the fact that fischer is the first high-level european politician to visit the new israeli regime should be met favorably in jerusalem .
israeli leaders have made it clear that their relationship to europe needs improvement ; upon taking office weeks ago , foreign minister shalom said he wanted to give precedence to improving israel-eu ties .
a flagging peace process nonetheless , fischer 's visit to jerusalem and ramallah wo n't be easy .
at present , there is no sign that the peace process could restart in the near future .
both sides are waiting to see what happens as a result of the u.s. campaign in iraq .
some in jerusalem say that only in the war 's aftermath will israel 's view - that terror must be fought militarily , and that the palestinian territories need to undergo democratic reforms - find wide acceptance .
in addition , israelis are displeased by germany 's stance against the war in iraq .
the israeli government and a majority of the population believe that the war will benefit israel if saddam hussein is removed from office .
in the last gulf war , hussein attacked israel with rockets .
some israelis accuse the german government of opposing the war on iraq for purely economic reasons , but israeli military historian martin van crefeld sees a different motivation : " the germans were know from about 1750 to 1945 as extremely dangerous militarists .
since 1945 , ' militarism ' has become a dirty word in germany .
and i think this is magnificent .
as a person , and also as an israeli and a jew . "
however , adel mana , an arab-israeli historian and head of the jerusalem reserach institute for palestinian history , says the root of the problems in the middle east lies in the israeli occupation .
" like all occupiers and colonialists , israel is not prepared to approach the problem : to end the occupation , stop the settlement policies , and guarantee palestinian independence , ' he says .
' israel sets every possible demand on the palestinians ... on the hopes that they ca n't be met , which prevents the real problems - occupation and oppression - from being addressed . "
mana also says neither jerusalem nor washington is interested in having europe be part of a solution to the conflict .
on monday and tuesday , fischer was also scheduled to meet with israeli defense minister shaul mofaz , opposition leader amram mitzna and president moshe katsav , and to pay a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .

foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in jerusalem on monday for a three day trip to israel and the palestinian terroritories .
but his arrival has been overshadowed by a dispute with justice minister yosef lapid . israel 's justice minister cancelled a planned meeting on monday with fischer after the two failed to agree on an appropriate venue for their tete-a-tete .
lapid wanted to meet with fischer at his office in the mainly arab eastern jerusalem - the part of the city that was captured by israel in 1967 , but which the palestinians claim as their future capital .
but fischer had sought to hold the meeting in a hotel in western jerusalem .
" it is not up to germany to decide where israeli sovereignty lies , " a spokesman for lapid said , announcing the cancellation of the meeting .
a full slate during his extended trip to israel , fischer is slated to meet with an array of politicians , including his newly appointed counterpart , foreign minister silvan shalom and prime minister ariel sharon .
meetings with designated palestinian prime minister mahmud abbas and president yassir arafat are planned for wednesday .
the main topic of discussion will be the " roadmap to peace , " the plan that was hammered out and presented by the so-called quartet - consisting of the united states , russia , european union and united nations - in december .
the israeli government subsequently sent washington an array of desired changes to the plan .
the current state of the war against iraq will also be discussed .
despite monday 's diplomatic hiccup , fischer is a welcome guest in israel .
many in the region appreciate his involvement in the peace process , which many have perceived as more neutral than washington 's .
the fact that fischer is the first high-level european politician to visit the new israeli regime should be met favorably in jerusalem .
israeli leaders have made it clear that their relationship to europe needs improvement ; upon taking office weeks ago , foreign minister shalom said he wanted to give precedence to improving israel-eu ties .
a flagging peace process nonetheless , fischer 's visit to jerusalem and ramallah wo n't be easy .
at present , there is no sign that the peace process could restart in the near future .
both sides are waiting to see what happens as a result of the u.s. campaign in iraq .
some in jerusalem say that only in the war 's aftermath will israel 's view - that terror must be fought militarily , and that the palestinian territories need to undergo democratic reforms - find wide acceptance .
in addition , israelis are displeased by germany 's stance against the war in iraq .
the israeli government and a majority of the population believe that the war will benefit israel if saddam hussein is removed from office .
in the last gulf war , hussein attacked israel with rockets .
some israelis accuse the german government of opposing the war on iraq for purely economic reasons , but israeli military historian martin van crefeld sees a different motivation : " the germans were know from about 1750 to 1945 as extremely dangerous militarists .
since 1945 , ' militarism ' has become a dirty word in germany .
and i think this is magnificent .
as a person , and also as an israeli and a jew . "
however , adel mana , an arab-israeli historian and head of the jerusalem reserach institute for palestinian history , says the root of the problems in the middle east lies in the israeli occupation .
" like all occupiers and colonialists , israel is not prepared to approach the problem : to end the occupation , stop the settlement policies , and guarantee palestinian independence , ' he says .
' israel sets every possible demand on the palestinians ... on the hopes that they ca n't be met , which prevents the real problems - occupation and oppression - from being addressed . "
mana also says neither jerusalem nor washington is interested in having europe be part of a solution to the conflict .
on monday and tuesday , fischer was also scheduled to meet with israeli defense minister shaul mofaz , opposition leader amram mitzna and president moshe katsav , and to pay a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .

belgium is no longer one of the first addresses for international justice .
its parliament has decided to limit its law on crimes against humanity in a move that may keep action against democratic leaders at bay . it was an issue on which israel and the united states saw eye to eye .
belgium , under its universal jurisdiction law , was out to prosecute the current leader of israel and a former president of the united states , and neither country liked the idea at all .
israel recalled its ambassador for consultations in february because of a new ruling that threatened to prosecute prime minister ariel sharon on war-crime charges after he left office .
and u.s. secretary of state colin powell warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake after he was named last month in a lawsuit for alleged crimes committed during the 1991 persian gulf war along with former president george bush sr. and current vice president dick cheney .
" it 's a serious problem , " powell said .
" for a place that is an international center , they should be a little bit concerned about this . "
apparently , belgium 's leaders were more than a little bit concerned , and on saturday , the parliament 's senate gave final approval to restrictions on the country 's " genocide law . "
law focused on genocide the original law allowed belgian courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
the amendments restrict the law 's scope , geraldine mattioli , international justice fellow at the organization human rights watch , told dw-world on monday .
the changes give the senior prosecutor , for example , the opportunity to decide whether a complaint will be examined in belgium or referred to the country concerned if there is no tangible belgian link .
the judiciary could also send complaints to the new international criminal court .
the case , however , would be pursued in belgium if the countries involved did not have a legal system comparable to belgium 's .
" during debates the justice minister made clear that not all cases will be referred to the country concerned .
we hope that the minister will only use it in exceptional cases , " mattioli said .
but mattioli said the revision raised the possibility that the belgian government might be more susceptible to pressure to avoid trying cases in belgium .
case against israeli prime minister legal action is pending against sharon for his role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried out by a christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
belgian foreign minister louis michel has spoken out against the case and said his country is not in a position to judge sharon .
the parliament had been working on altering the law since last july .
mattioli said the effort to alter the law gained momentum after the complaint was filed on march 19 against bush senior and members of his administration , including cheney and powell .
cheney was defense secretary , and powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
the suit was filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a baghdad shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 war .
after the case was filed , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt and michel pushed to modify the law before the end of the legislative session last week .
belgian parliamentary elections are scheduled for may 18 .
final approval came saturday when the senate approved the changes in a 36-to-27 vote with five abstentions .
the approval backed an earlier vote by the house of representatives .
but verhofstadt 's liberal party had to rely on the oppositional christian democrats and the extreme right-wing vlaamse blok to push through the bill .
lawmakers from belgian 's ruling green and socialist parties voted against the amendments because they said the case against sharon should not be dropped .
the amendments will affect only cases filed after july 1 , 2002 - like the one against bush senior - and only those where the country of the accused has war crimes legislation .
belgium as a last resort belgium , though , should not be the place people go first to see crimes punished , mattioli said .
" the first place to prosecute a person should be where the crime was committed , " she said .
she also emphasized the importance of international courts of justice , from the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to the international criminal court .
" belgian law should only be used as a last resort , " mattioli said .
about 30 current or former political leaders are facing action under the belgian law .
other potential defendants include iraqi president saddam hussein , palestinian leader yassir arafat and cuban leader fidel castro .
only one case has been brought to court since the 1993 law was enacted .
four rwandans were found guilty of involvement in the 1994 genocide in the african country and were sentenced to up to 15 years in prison in june 2001 . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world war crimes court opens the international criminal court officially opened on tuesday .
but along with iraq and china , the united states is n't a party to the tribunal which intends to prosecute crimes against humanity throughout the world .

eu finance ministers asked the dutch head of the european central bank to stay on until his designated successor can be cleared of corruption charges - or someone else can be found for the post . european central bank president wim duisenberg agreed at a summit of eu finance ministers in athens over the weekend to stay in office until a successor can be appointed . " i 'm not going to tell anyone how long i 'm going to stay , " he said . " i will be president of the ecb up to and until the day my duly appointed successor takes office , " duisenberg told reporters on saturday . duisenberg had planned to retire on his 68th birthday , july 9 , to make room for bank of france governor jean-claude trichet .
president jacques chirac demanded an agreement in the european union five years ago to shorten duisenberg 's term by three years so that a frenchman could take his place as head of the bank . a touchy situation trichet , however , has been implicated in a corruption scandal involving the state-supported bank credit lyonnais .
he is charged with having possessed knowledge of the bank 's misleading accounting practices while he was at the french finance ministry in the 1990s .
if convicted , trichet would no longer be a viable contender for the ecb post . a verdict in the case in expected on june 18 - and even if trichet is acquitted , there would be very little time for him to be groomed to succeed duisenberg before his previously announced retirement date . european leaders are anxious to avoid a messy succession at the ecb during a war , global economic insecurity and a time of stagnant euro zone growth .
ecb officials also fear that a difficult succession could tarnish the young bank 's reputation , with only four years having passed since the introduction of the euro . duisenberg has made no secret of the fact that he would have preferred to serve a full eight-year term in the office . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank president expected to postpone retirement europe 's finance ministers are meeting in athens this weekend to determine the future of european central bank president wim duisenberg .

british forces are now claiming they have unhindered passage through the majority of basra after a massive assault by ground troops .
it was described as " a show of force " and not the anticipated " battle for baghdad . "
u.s. tanks rolled into the southwestern district of baghdad on saturday to engage republican guard units in the first coalition push into the iraqi capital .
when the tanks rolled in again on sunday , u.s. central command in doha , qatar , maintained that these probing attacks were not the main offensive for the city .
however , after baghdad was once again rocked by air strikes and heavy shelling in dawn raids on monday , major michael birmingham , chief public affairs officer for the u.s. 3rd infantry division , told the reuters news service that the march on baghdad was more or less under way .
" we 're attacking right down in the center of the city right now , " birmingham said .
" the other day was just an incursion .
this is for real . "
troops advance on city from all fronts more than 100 tanks and armored vehicles poured into the city at first light as a-10 " tankbuster " fighter planess pounded iraqi forces around the city center and outskirts .
the column of more than 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers forced its way through heavy resistance into central baghdad where a fierce battle erupted as republican guard divisions attempted to repel the american tanks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : u.s. troops advance through the suburbs of baghdad .
elsewhere in the city , u.s. troops were reported to be in control of saddam hussein 's main presidential palace while on the western outskirts , american forces were involved in a firefight on the banks of the tigris river .
marines were also reported to be entering the city from the southeast .
outside the city , u.s. military sources said american troops now controlled most of the major routes into baghdad .

anti-american or anti-bush ? europe -pipe- 07.04.2003 boycott of europe loses steam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new mini : it 's made in germany , but it 's a bestseller in the u.s. so far , the feared american boycott of german and french products has failed to materialize .
but an increasing number of europeans are shunning coke , jack daniels and other symbols of the u.s. several weeks ago , senators and members of congress in the united states raised the specter of a boycott against german products and services .
the calls came after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he would vote against any resolutions introduced at the united nations legitimizing a war against iraq .
earlier , during his re-election campaign , schröder said he was against a u.s. war against iraq and would not provide any military or financial support for one .
but anti-german sentiments in the united states have so far failed to cross over into trade relations .
in fact , sales are growing for mercedes-benz , which has seen its revenues stateside increase by 1.8 percent , and bmw , which has booked 18 percent growth - largely due to the popularity of its revamped mini .
the only exception is volkswagen , whose sales have been sluggish across the board .
arndt ellinghorst , an analyst for the german bank westlb , told dw-world that consumers purchasing durable goods , like luxury cars , tend not to be influenced by emotions .
and if the revenue figures are anything to go by , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to criticize the u.s. ' war against iraq has had little impact on german-american trade ties .
business as usual producers of consumer goods and foods have also reported business as usual , suggesting that calls for a boycott have found little resonance .
even french wines continue to fare the same , despite the trend in the u.s. to rename french foods , like the u.s. senate 's re-christening of french fries .
french wine sales have declined in recent years , but not over differences of opinion , but rather the popularity of californian and australian wines , according to the wine institute in san francisco , california .
yet , despite the deep conflict between paris and washington over the iraq war and the related calls for a boycott of french products , market share losses for french wine were lower during the first part of the year than they were in 2002 .
though there are plenty of sites out there devoted to bashing " old europe " - including www.germanystinks.com and www.francestinks.com , which have made an art of trashing european political leaders and encourage users to offer renaming suggests for foods that are too german sounding , like the hamburger - they have so far failed to influence the spending decisions of american consumers , who are still keen to drive german cars and drink german beer .
europe 's answer ironically , washington bashing sites in europe seem to be finding more resonance than their american counterparts .
a number of the sites call on consumers to boycott american products as a form of protest against president george w. bush 's war policies .
" send letters to american firms , but buy your products from european companies , " a statement on www.amerika-boykott.com reads .
the site provides links to lists of american companies and the products they sell or own in europe .
the leader of germany 's protestant church , manfred kock , has criticized calls for a boycott against u.s. and british products .
while firmly maintaining his opposition to the war , kock has said his criticism of washington 's should not be perceived as anti-american .
some members of the catholic church , however , have taken a different approach .
in a recent interview with a public broadcaster in berlin , cardinal georg sterzinsky , who leads the church in the city , said he sympathized with people who are boycotting u.s. products .
europe responds in germany , calls for such a boycott have found at least some support according to anecdotal evidence .
some restaurants have stopped serving coca cola andjack daniels whiskey .
they 've also stopped using heinz ketchup in recipes .
restaurants have also reported that more customers are asking for non-american alternatives to coke , like germany 's homegrown afri-cola .
coca cola germany has confirmed that the boycott has had some impact on its business operations .
klaus hillebrand , spokesman for coke in essen , said the company had felt the boycott in a few different areas .
" we 're a symbol for america and we have to live with these kinds of expressions of opinion , " he said .
but he also pointed out , ironically , that the people who will most suffer from a boycott are the company 's 11,000 german employees , whose jobs could be at risk if sales drop .
in germany , coke is produced by the country 's 24 domestic bottlers .

the transport by inland cargo vessels helps to cut down costs and is more environment-friendly , as the transportation on the road usually needs some 70 trucks to move the same amount of cars .
some 260.000 cars yearly leave the ford plant in cologne by ship , some 100.000 are transported to britain by ship , which is the cheapest way to transport the cars .
-lrb- ap photo / frank augstein -rrb- the same holds true for a number of other american companies that manufacture and sell products in germany with a large local staff , including the ford motor company , which has a major manufacturing plant in cologne .
fred irwin , the head of the american chamber of commerce in frankfurt , notes that many american products are manufactured under license in germany .
thus , a boycott would do more harm to the german economy than it would to the american companies it is targeting .
for the most part , he said , there have only been isolated instances of germans boycotting u.s. products .
but there have been a few exceptions , but mostly in the small change department .
darmstadt-based bicycle-maker riese and müller has stopped purchasing parts from american companies because of its opposition to the war .
until the ban on american products , the company had purchased close to € 300,000 a year in parts from companies based in the states .
in a statement , however , the company said it would resume purchases from the u.s. if the three companies it does business with there issue public statements opposing president george w. bush 's war policies .
elusive contracts a far more pressing concern than a boycott for german and french companies is the fear of being cut out of the rebuilding effort after the war in iraq ends .
the u.s. ambassador to france in paris , howard leach , recently said contracts would be awarded " according to the rules of free market competition " and " in the best interest of the iraqis . "
but that provides little comfort for companies here , who are still smarting from the first gulf war .

earlier , during his re-election campaign , schröder said he was against a u.s. war against iraq and would not provide any military or financial support for one .
but anti-german sentiments in the united states have so far failed to cross over into trade relations .
in fact , sales are growing for mercedes-benz , which has seen its revenues stateside increase by 1.8 percent , and bmw , which has booked 18 percent growth - largely due to the popularity of its revamped mini .
the only exception is volkswagen , whose sales have been sluggish across the board .
arndt ellinghorst , an analyst for the german bank westlb , told dw-world that consumers purchasing durable goods , like luxury cars , tend not to be influenced by emotions .
and if the revenue figures are anything to go by , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to criticize the u.s. ' war against iraq has had little impact on german-american trade ties .
business as usual producers of consumer goods and foods have also reported business as usual , suggesting that calls for a boycott have found little resonance .
even french wines continue to fare the same , despite the trend in the u.s. to rename french foods , like the u.s. senate 's re-christening of french fries .
french wine sales have declined in recent years , but not over differences of opinion , but rather the popularity of californian and australian wines , according to the wine institute in san francisco , california .
yet , despite the deep conflict between paris and washington over the iraq war and the related calls for a boycott of french products , market share losses for french wine were lower during the first part of the year than they were in 2002 .
though there are plenty of sites out there devoted to bashing " old europe " - including www.germanystinks.com and www.francestinks.com , which have made an art of trashing european political leaders and encourage users to offer renaming suggests for foods that are too german sounding , like the hamburger - they have so far failed to influence the spending decisions of american consumers , who are still keen to drive german cars and drink german beer .
europe 's answer ironically , washington bashing sites in europe seem to be finding more resonance than their american counterparts .
a number of the sites call on consumers to boycott american products as a form of protest against president george w. bush 's war policies .
" send letters to american firms , but buy your products from european companies , " a statement on www.amerika-boykott.com reads .
the site provides links to lists of american companies and the products they sell or own in europe .
the leader of germany 's protestant church , manfred kock , has criticized calls for a boycott against u.s. and british products .
while firmly maintaining his opposition to the war , kock has said his criticism of washington 's should not be perceived as anti-american .
some members of the catholic church , however , have taken a different approach .
in a recent interview with a public broadcaster in berlin , cardinal georg sterzinsky , who leads the church in the city , said he sympathized with people who are boycotting u.s. products .
europe responds in germany , calls for such a boycott have found at least some support according to anecdotal evidence .
some restaurants have stopped serving coca cola andjack daniels whiskey .
they 've also stopped using heinz ketchup in recipes .
restaurants have also reported that more customers are asking for non-american alternatives to coke , like germany 's homegrown afri-cola .
coca cola germany has confirmed that the boycott has had some impact on its business operations .
klaus hillebrand , spokesman for coke in essen , said the company had felt the boycott in a few different areas .
" we 're a symbol for america and we have to live with these kinds of expressions of opinion , " he said .
but he also pointed out , ironically , that the people who will most suffer from a boycott are the company 's 11,000 german employees , whose jobs could be at risk if sales drop .
in germany , coke is produced by the country 's 24 domestic bottlers .

the transport by inland cargo vessels helps to cut down costs and is more environment-friendly , as the transportation on the road usually needs some 70 trucks to move the same amount of cars .

elusive contracts a far more pressing concern than a boycott for german and french companies is the fear of being cut out of the rebuilding effort after the war in iraq ends .

belgium is no longer one of the first addresses for international justice .
its parliament has decided to limit its law on crimes against humanity in a move that may keep action against democratic leaders at bay . it was an issue on which israel and the united states saw eye to eye .
belgium , under its universal jurisdiction law , was out to prosecute the current leader of israel and a former president of the united states , and neither country liked the idea at all .
israel recalled its ambassador for consultations in february because of a new ruling that threatened to prosecute prime minister ariel sharon on war-crime charges after he left office .
and u.s. secretary of state colin powell warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake after he was named last month in a lawsuit for alleged crimes committed during the 1991 persian gulf war along with former president george bush sr. and current vice president dick cheney .
" it 's a serious problem , " powell said .
" for a place that is an international center , they should be a little bit concerned about this . "
apparently , belgium 's leaders were more than a little bit concerned , and on saturday , the parliament 's senate gave final approval to restrictions on the country 's " genocide law . "
law focused on genocide the original law allowed belgian courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
the amendments restrict the law 's scope , geraldine mattioli , international justice fellow at the organization human rights watch , told dw-world on monday .
the changes give the senior prosecutor , for example , the opportunity to decide whether a complaint will be examined in belgium or referred to the country concerned if there is no tangible belgian link .
the judiciary could also send complaints to the new international criminal court .
the case , however , would be pursued in belgium if the countries involved did not have a legal system comparable to belgium 's .
" during debates the justice minister made clear that not all cases will be referred to the country concerned .
we hope that the minister will only use it in exceptional cases , " mattioli said .
but mattioli said the revision raised the possibility that the belgian government might be more susceptible to pressure to avoid trying cases in belgium .
case against israeli prime minister legal action is pending against sharon for his role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried out by a christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
belgian foreign minister louis michel has spoken out against the case and said his country is not in a position to judge sharon .
the parliament had been working on altering the law since last july .
mattioli said the effort to alter the law gained momentum after the complaint was filed on march 19 against bush senior and members of his administration , including cheney and powell .
cheney was defense secretary , and powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
the suit was filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a baghdad shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 war .
after the case was filed , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt and michel pushed to modify the law before the end of the legislative session last week .
belgian parliamentary elections are scheduled for may 18 .
final approval came saturday when the senate approved the changes in a 36-to-27 vote with five abstentions .
the approval backed an earlier vote by the house of representatives .
but verhofstadt 's liberal party had to rely on the oppositional christian democrats and the extreme right-wing vlaamse blok to push through the bill .
lawmakers from belgian 's ruling green and socialist parties voted against the amendments because they said the case against sharon should not be dropped .
the amendments will affect only cases filed after july 1 , 2002 - like the one against bush senior - and only those where the country of the accused has war crimes legislation .
belgium as a last resort belgium , though , should not be the place people go first to see crimes punished , mattioli said .
" the first place to prosecute a person should be where the crime was committed , " she said .
she also emphasized the importance of international courts of justice , from the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to the international criminal court .
" belgian law should only be used as a last resort , " mattioli said .
about 30 current or former political leaders are facing action under the belgian law .
other potential defendants include iraqi president saddam hussein , palestinian leader yassir arafat and cuban leader fidel castro .
only one case has been brought to court since the 1993 law was enacted .
four rwandans were found guilty of involvement in the 1994 genocide in the african country and were sentenced to up to 15 years in prison in june 2001 . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world war crimes court opens the international criminal court officially opened on tuesday .

belgium is no longer one of the first addresses for international justice .
its parliament has decided to limit its law on crimes against humanity in a move that may keep action against democratic leaders at bay . it was an issue on which israel and the united states saw eye to eye .
belgium , under its universal jurisdiction law , was out to prosecute the current leader of israel and a former president of the united states , and neither country liked the idea at all .
israel recalled its ambassador for consultations in february because of a new ruling that threatened to prosecute prime minister ariel sharon on war-crime charges after he left office .
and u.s. secretary of state colin powell warned that belgium was putting its international reputation at stake after he was named last month in a lawsuit for alleged crimes committed during the 1991 persian gulf war along with former president george bush sr. and current vice president dick cheney .
" it 's a serious problem , " powell said .
" for a place that is an international center , they should be a little bit concerned about this . "
apparently , belgium 's leaders were more than a little bit concerned , and on saturday , the parliament 's senate gave final approval to restrictions on the country 's " genocide law . "
law focused on genocide the original law allowed belgian courts to prosecute people accused of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes regardless of where the crime occurred or whether the suspects or victims were belgian .
the amendments restrict the law 's scope , geraldine mattioli , international justice fellow at the organization human rights watch , told dw-world on monday .
the changes give the senior prosecutor , for example , the opportunity to decide whether a complaint will be examined in belgium or referred to the country concerned if there is no tangible belgian link .
the judiciary could also send complaints to the new international criminal court .
the case , however , would be pursued in belgium if the countries involved did not have a legal system comparable to belgium 's .
" during debates the justice minister made clear that not all cases will be referred to the country concerned .
we hope that the minister will only use it in exceptional cases , " mattioli said .
but mattioli said the revision raised the possibility that the belgian government might be more susceptible to pressure to avoid trying cases in belgium .
case against israeli prime minister legal action is pending against sharon for his role in the massacre of up to 2,000 people carried out by a christian militia in 1982 in the sabra and shatilla refugee camps in lebanon .
belgian foreign minister louis michel has spoken out against the case and said his country is not in a position to judge sharon .
the parliament had been working on altering the law since last july .
mattioli said the effort to alter the law gained momentum after the complaint was filed on march 19 against bush senior and members of his administration , including cheney and powell .
cheney was defense secretary , and powell was chairman of the joint chiefs of staff .
the suit was filed by the families of iraqi victims of a u.s. attack on a baghdad shelter that killed 400 people during the 1991 war .
after the case was filed , belgian prime minister guy verhofstadt and michel pushed to modify the law before the end of the legislative session last week .
belgian parliamentary elections are scheduled for may 18 .
final approval came saturday when the senate approved the changes in a 36-to-27 vote with five abstentions .
the approval backed an earlier vote by the house of representatives .
but verhofstadt 's liberal party had to rely on the oppositional christian democrats and the extreme right-wing vlaamse blok to push through the bill .
lawmakers from belgian 's ruling green and socialist parties voted against the amendments because they said the case against sharon should not be dropped .
the amendments will affect only cases filed after july 1 , 2002 - like the one against bush senior - and only those where the country of the accused has war crimes legislation .
belgium as a last resort belgium , though , should not be the place people go first to see crimes punished , mattioli said .
" the first place to prosecute a person should be where the crime was committed , " she said .
she also emphasized the importance of international courts of justice , from the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia to the international criminal court .
" belgian law should only be used as a last resort , " mattioli said .
about 30 current or former political leaders are facing action under the belgian law .
other potential defendants include iraqi president saddam hussein , palestinian leader yassir arafat and cuban leader fidel castro .
only one case has been brought to court since the 1993 law was enacted .
four rwandans were found guilty of involvement in the 1994 genocide in the african country and were sentenced to up to 15 years in prison in june 2001 . nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de world war crimes court opens the international criminal court officially opened on tuesday .

anti-american or anti-bush ? europe -pipe- 07.04.2003 boycott of europe loses steam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new mini : it 's made in germany , but it 's a bestseller in the u.s. so far , the feared american boycott of german and french products has failed to materialize .
but an increasing number of europeans are shunning coke , jack daniels and other symbols of the u.s. several weeks ago , senators and members of congress in the united states raised the specter of a boycott against german products and services .
the calls came after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he would vote against any resolutions introduced at the united nations legitimizing a war against iraq .
earlier , during his re-election campaign , schröder said he was against a u.s. war against iraq and would not provide any military or financial support for one .
but anti-german sentiments in the united states have so far failed to cross over into trade relations .
in fact , sales are growing for mercedes-benz , which has seen its revenues stateside increase by 1.8 percent , and bmw , which has booked 18 percent growth - largely due to the popularity of its revamped mini .
the only exception is volkswagen , whose sales have been sluggish across the board .
arndt ellinghorst , an analyst for the german bank westlb , told dw-world that consumers purchasing durable goods , like luxury cars , tend not to be influenced by emotions .
and if the revenue figures are anything to go by , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to criticize the u.s. ' war against iraq has had little impact on german-american trade ties .
business as usual producers of consumer goods and foods have also reported business as usual , suggesting that calls for a boycott have found little resonance .
even french wines continue to fare the same , despite the trend in the u.s. to rename french foods , like the u.s. senate 's re-christening of french fries .
french wine sales have declined in recent years , but not over differences of opinion , but rather the popularity of californian and australian wines , according to the wine institute in san francisco , california .
yet , despite the deep conflict between paris and washington over the iraq war and the related calls for a boycott of french products , market share losses for french wine were lower during the first part of the year than they were in 2002 .
though there are plenty of sites out there devoted to bashing " old europe " - including www.germanystinks.com and www.francestinks.com , which have made an art of trashing european political leaders and encourage users to offer renaming suggests for foods that are too german sounding , like the hamburger - they have so far failed to influence the spending decisions of american consumers , who are still keen to drive german cars and drink german beer .
europe 's answer ironically , washington bashing sites in europe seem to be finding more resonance than their american counterparts .
a number of the sites call on consumers to boycott american products as a form of protest against president george w. bush 's war policies .
" send letters to american firms , but buy your products from european companies , " a statement on www.amerika-boykott.com reads .
the site provides links to lists of american companies and the products they sell or own in europe .
the leader of germany 's protestant church , manfred kock , has criticized calls for a boycott against u.s. and british products .
while firmly maintaining his opposition to the war , kock has said his criticism of washington 's should not be perceived as anti-american .
some members of the catholic church , however , have taken a different approach .
in a recent interview with a public broadcaster in berlin , cardinal georg sterzinsky , who leads the church in the city , said he sympathized with people who are boycotting u.s. products .
europe responds in germany , calls for such a boycott have found at least some support according to anecdotal evidence .
some restaurants have stopped serving coca cola andjack daniels whiskey .
they 've also stopped using heinz ketchup in recipes .
restaurants have also reported that more customers are asking for non-american alternatives to coke , like germany 's homegrown afri-cola .
coca cola germany has confirmed that the boycott has had some impact on its business operations .
klaus hillebrand , spokesman for coke in essen , said the company had felt the boycott in a few different areas .
" we 're a symbol for america and we have to live with these kinds of expressions of opinion , " he said .
but he also pointed out , ironically , that the people who will most suffer from a boycott are the company 's 11,000 german employees , whose jobs could be at risk if sales drop .
in germany , coke is produced by the country 's 24 domestic bottlers .

the transport by inland cargo vessels helps to cut down costs and is more environment-friendly , as the transportation on the road usually needs some 70 trucks to move the same amount of cars .

thus , a boycott would do more harm to the german economy than it would to the american companies it is targeting .
for the most part , he said , there have only been isolated instances of germans boycotting u.s. products .
but there have been a few exceptions , but mostly in the small change department .
darmstadt-based bicycle-maker riese and müller has stopped purchasing parts from american companies because of its opposition to the war .
until the ban on american products , the company had purchased close to € 300,000 a year in parts from companies based in the states .

anti-american or anti-bush ? europe -pipe- 07.04.2003 boycott of europe loses steam großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw 's new mini : it 's made in germany , but it 's a bestseller in the u.s. so far , the feared american boycott of german and french products has failed to materialize .
but an increasing number of europeans are shunning coke , jack daniels and other symbols of the u.s. several weeks ago , senators and members of congress in the united states raised the specter of a boycott against german products and services .
the calls came after german chancellor gerhard schröder said he would vote against any resolutions introduced at the united nations legitimizing a war against iraq .
earlier , during his re-election campaign , schröder said he was against a u.s. war against iraq and would not provide any military or financial support for one .
but anti-german sentiments in the united states have so far failed to cross over into trade relations .
in fact , sales are growing for mercedes-benz , which has seen its revenues stateside increase by 1.8 percent , and bmw , which has booked 18 percent growth - largely due to the popularity of its revamped mini .
the only exception is volkswagen , whose sales have been sluggish across the board .
arndt ellinghorst , an analyst for the german bank westlb , told dw-world that consumers purchasing durable goods , like luxury cars , tend not to be influenced by emotions .
and if the revenue figures are anything to go by , german chancellor gerhard schröder 's decision to criticize the u.s. ' war against iraq has had little impact on german-american trade ties .
business as usual producers of consumer goods and foods have also reported business as usual , suggesting that calls for a boycott have found little resonance .
even french wines continue to fare the same , despite the trend in the u.s. to rename french foods , like the u.s. senate 's re-christening of french fries .
french wine sales have declined in recent years , but not over differences of opinion , but rather the popularity of californian and australian wines , according to the wine institute in san francisco , california .
yet , despite the deep conflict between paris and washington over the iraq war and the related calls for a boycott of french products , market share losses for french wine were lower during the first part of the year than they were in 2002 .
though there are plenty of sites out there devoted to bashing " old europe " - including www.germanystinks.com and www.francestinks.com , which have made an art of trashing european political leaders and encourage users to offer renaming suggests for foods that are too german sounding , like the hamburger - they have so far failed to influence the spending decisions of american consumers , who are still keen to drive german cars and drink german beer .
europe 's answer ironically , washington bashing sites in europe seem to be finding more resonance than their american counterparts .
a number of the sites call on consumers to boycott american products as a form of protest against president george w. bush 's war policies .
" send letters to american firms , but buy your products from european companies , " a statement on www.amerika-boykott.com reads .
the site provides links to lists of american companies and the products they sell or own in europe .
the leader of germany 's protestant church , manfred kock , has criticized calls for a boycott against u.s. and british products .
while firmly maintaining his opposition to the war , kock has said his criticism of washington 's should not be perceived as anti-american .
some members of the catholic church , however , have taken a different approach .
in a recent interview with a public broadcaster in berlin , cardinal georg sterzinsky , who leads the church in the city , said he sympathized with people who are boycotting u.s. products .
europe responds in germany , calls for such a boycott have found at least some support according to anecdotal evidence .
some restaurants have stopped serving coca cola andjack daniels whiskey .
they 've also stopped using heinz ketchup in recipes .
restaurants have also reported that more customers are asking for non-american alternatives to coke , like germany 's homegrown afri-cola .
coca cola germany has confirmed that the boycott has had some impact on its business operations .
klaus hillebrand , spokesman for coke in essen , said the company had felt the boycott in a few different areas .
" we 're a symbol for america and we have to live with these kinds of expressions of opinion , " he said .
but he also pointed out , ironically , that the people who will most suffer from a boycott are the company 's 11,000 german employees , whose jobs could be at risk if sales drop .
in germany , coke is produced by the country 's 24 domestic bottlers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the giant inland cargo ship " barco " carries some 550 ford fiesta and ford fusion cars on board as it moves on the river rhein near cologne bound for britain , wednesday , aug .
28 , 2002 .
the transport by inland cargo vessels helps to cut down costs and is more environment-friendly , as the transportation on the road usually needs some 70 trucks to move the same amount of cars .
some 260.000 cars yearly leave the ford plant in cologne by ship , some 100.000 are transported to britain by ship , which is the cheapest way to transport the cars .
-lrb- ap photo / frank augstein -rrb- the same holds true for a number of other american companies that manufacture and sell products in germany with a large local staff , including the ford motor company , which has a major manufacturing plant in cologne .
fred irwin , the head of the american chamber of commerce in frankfurt , notes that many american products are manufactured under license in germany .
thus , a boycott would do more harm to the german economy than it would to the american companies it is targeting .
for the most part , he said , there have only been isolated instances of germans boycotting u.s. products .
but there have been a few exceptions , but mostly in the small change department .
darmstadt-based bicycle-maker riese and müller has stopped purchasing parts from american companies because of its opposition to the war .
until the ban on american products , the company had purchased close to € 300,000 a year in parts from companies based in the states .
in a statement , however , the company said it would resume purchases from the u.s. if the three companies it does business with there issue public statements opposing president george w. bush 's war policies .
elusive contracts a far more pressing concern than a boycott for german and french companies is the fear of being cut out of the rebuilding effort after the war in iraq ends .
the u.s. ambassador to france in paris , howard leach , recently said contracts would be awarded " according to the rules of free market competition " and " in the best interest of the iraqis . "
but that provides little comfort for companies here , who are still smarting from the first gulf war .
in 1991 , the u.s. awarded the lion 's share of contracts to american firms despite the fact that germany provided massive financial aid during the first gulf war .

while firmly maintaining his opposition to the war , kock has said his criticism of washington 's should not be perceived as anti-american .
some members of the catholic church , however , have taken a different approach .
in a recent interview with a public broadcaster in berlin , cardinal georg sterzinsky , who leads the church in the city , said he sympathized with people who are boycotting u.s. products .
europe responds in germany , calls for such a boycott have found at least some support according to anecdotal evidence .
some restaurants have stopped serving coca cola andjack daniels whiskey .
they 've also stopped using heinz ketchup in recipes .
restaurants have also reported that more customers are asking for non-american alternatives to coke , like germany 's homegrown afri-cola .
coca cola germany has confirmed that the boycott has had some impact on its business operations .
klaus hillebrand , spokesman for coke in essen , said the company had felt the boycott in a few different areas .
" we 're a symbol for america and we have to live with these kinds of expressions of opinion , " he said .
but he also pointed out , ironically , that the people who will most suffer from a boycott are the company 's 11,000 german employees , whose jobs could be at risk if sales drop .
in germany , coke is produced by the country 's 24 domestic bottlers .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the giant inland cargo ship " barco " carries some 550 ford fiesta and ford fusion cars on board as it moves on the river rhein near cologne bound for britain , wednesday , aug .
28 , 2002 .
the transport by inland cargo vessels helps to cut down costs and is more environment-friendly , as the transportation on the road usually needs some 70 trucks to move the same amount of cars .
some 260.000 cars yearly leave the ford plant in cologne by ship , some 100.000 are transported to britain by ship , which is the cheapest way to transport the cars .
-lrb- ap photo / frank augstein -rrb- the same holds true for a number of other american companies that manufacture and sell products in germany with a large local staff , including the ford motor company , which has a major manufacturing plant in cologne .
fred irwin , the head of the american chamber of commerce in frankfurt , notes that many american products are manufactured under license in germany .
thus , a boycott would do more harm to the german economy than it would to the american companies it is targeting .
for the most part , he said , there have only been isolated instances of germans boycotting u.s. products .
but there have been a few exceptions , but mostly in the small change department .
darmstadt-based bicycle-maker riese and müller has stopped purchasing parts from american companies because of its opposition to the war .
until the ban on american products , the company had purchased close to € 300,000 a year in parts from companies based in the states .
in a statement , however , the company said it would resume purchases from the u.s. if the three companies it does business with there issue public statements opposing president george w. bush 's war policies .
elusive contracts a far more pressing concern than a boycott for german and french companies is the fear of being cut out of the rebuilding effort after the war in iraq ends .
the u.s. ambassador to france in paris , howard leach , recently said contracts would be awarded " according to the rules of free market competition " and " in the best interest of the iraqis . "
but that provides little comfort for companies here , who are still smarting from the first gulf war .
in 1991 , the u.s. awarded the lion 's share of contracts to american firms despite the fact that germany provided massive financial aid during the first gulf war .
together , germany , japan , saudi arabia and kuwait financed 80 percent of the military operation . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

british forces are now claiming they have unhindered passage through the majority of basra after a massive assault by ground troops .
it was described as " a show of force " and not the anticipated " battle for baghdad . "
u.s. tanks rolled into the southwestern district of baghdad on saturday to engage republican guard units in the first coalition push into the iraqi capital .
when the tanks rolled in again on sunday , u.s. central command in doha , qatar , maintained that these probing attacks were not the main offensive for the city .
however , after baghdad was once again rocked by air strikes and heavy shelling in dawn raids on monday , major michael birmingham , chief public affairs officer for the u.s. 3rd infantry division , told the reuters news service that the march on baghdad was more or less under way .
" we 're attacking right down in the center of the city right now , " birmingham said .
" the other day was just an incursion .
this is for real . "
troops advance on city from all fronts more than 100 tanks and armored vehicles poured into the city at first light as a-10 " tankbuster " fighter planess pounded iraqi forces around the city center and outskirts .
the column of more than 100 tanks and armored personnel carriers forced its way through heavy resistance into central baghdad where a fierce battle erupted as republican guard divisions attempted to repel the american tanks .

" i will be president of the ecb up to and until the day my duly appointed successor takes office , " duisenberg told reporters on saturday . duisenberg had planned to retire on his 68th birthday , july 9 , to make room for bank of france governor jean-claude trichet .
president jacques chirac demanded an agreement in the european union five years ago to shorten duisenberg 's term by three years so that a frenchman could take his place as head of the bank . a touchy situation trichet , however , has been implicated in a corruption scandal involving the state-supported bank credit lyonnais .
he is charged with having possessed knowledge of the bank 's misleading accounting practices while he was at the french finance ministry in the 1990s .
if convicted , trichet would no longer be a viable contender for the ecb post . a verdict in the case in expected on june 18 - and even if trichet is acquitted , there would be very little time for him to be groomed to succeed duisenberg before his previously announced retirement date . european leaders are anxious to avoid a messy succession at the ecb during a war , global economic insecurity and a time of stagnant euro zone growth .
ecb officials also fear that a difficult succession could tarnish the young bank 's reputation , with only four years having passed since the introduction of the euro . duisenberg has made no secret of the fact that he would have preferred to serve a full eight-year term in the office . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european central bank president expected to postpone retirement europe 's finance ministers are meeting in athens this weekend to determine the future of european central bank president wim duisenberg .

foreign minister joschka fischer arrived in jerusalem on monday for a three day trip to israel and the palestinian terroritories .
but his arrival has been overshadowed by a dispute with justice minister yosef lapid . israel 's justice minister cancelled a planned meeting on monday with fischer after the two failed to agree on an appropriate venue for their tete-a-tete .
lapid wanted to meet with fischer at his office in the mainly arab eastern jerusalem - the part of the city that was captured by israel in 1967 , but which the palestinians claim as their future capital .
but fischer had sought to hold the meeting in a hotel in western jerusalem .
" it is not up to germany to decide where israeli sovereignty lies , " a spokesman for lapid said , announcing the cancellation of the meeting .
a full slate during his extended trip to israel , fischer is slated to meet with an array of politicians , including his newly appointed counterpart , foreign minister silvan shalom and prime minister ariel sharon .
meetings with designated palestinian prime minister mahmud abbas and president yassir arafat are planned for wednesday .
the main topic of discussion will be the " roadmap to peace , " the plan that was hammered out and presented by the so-called quartet - consisting of the united states , russia , european union and united nations - in december .
the israeli government subsequently sent washington an array of desired changes to the plan .
the current state of the war against iraq will also be discussed .
despite monday 's diplomatic hiccup , fischer is a welcome guest in israel .
many in the region appreciate his involvement in the peace process , which many have perceived as more neutral than washington 's .
the fact that fischer is the first high-level european politician to visit the new israeli regime should be met favorably in jerusalem .
israeli leaders have made it clear that their relationship to europe needs improvement ; upon taking office weeks ago , foreign minister shalom said he wanted to give precedence to improving israel-eu ties .
a flagging peace process nonetheless , fischer 's visit to jerusalem and ramallah wo n't be easy .
at present , there is no sign that the peace process could restart in the near future .
both sides are waiting to see what happens as a result of the u.s. campaign in iraq .
some in jerusalem say that only in the war 's aftermath will israel 's view - that terror must be fought militarily , and that the palestinian territories need to undergo democratic reforms - find wide acceptance .
in addition , israelis are displeased by germany 's stance against the war in iraq .
the israeli government and a majority of the population believe that the war will benefit israel if saddam hussein is removed from office .
in the last gulf war , hussein attacked israel with rockets .
some israelis accuse the german government of opposing the war on iraq for purely economic reasons , but israeli military historian martin van crefeld sees a different motivation : " the germans were know from about 1750 to 1945 as extremely dangerous militarists .
since 1945 , ' militarism ' has become a dirty word in germany .
and i think this is magnificent .
as a person , and also as an israeli and a jew . "
however , adel mana , an arab-israeli historian and head of the jerusalem reserach institute for palestinian history , says the root of the problems in the middle east lies in the israeli occupation .
" like all occupiers and colonialists , israel is not prepared to approach the problem : to end the occupation , stop the settlement policies , and guarantee palestinian independence , ' he says .
' israel sets every possible demand on the palestinians ... on the hopes that they ca n't be met , which prevents the real problems - occupation and oppression - from being addressed . "
mana also says neither jerusalem nor washington is interested in having europe be part of a solution to the conflict .
on monday and tuesday , fischer was also scheduled to meet with israeli defense minister shaul mofaz , opposition leader amram mitzna and president moshe katsav , and to pay a visit to the holocaust memorial yad vashem .
on wednesay , a visit to palestinian parliament president abu ala is also planned . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the aim is to show war leaders as peace leaders the venue is belfast , which is unexpected .
one suspects a pay-off for tony blair , who has more than post-war iraq on his agenda .
he also wants president bush to endorse a new political initiative in northern ireland , and a push for talks between israelis and palestinians .
the idea is to show the war leaders as peace makers .
the americans and british have drawn up a three-stage procedure for post-war iraq , though much of the detail remains to be filled in uncertainty over un role in iraq the most immediate issue is obviously iraq .
the big problem is that there is no provisional government to take power , as there was in so many countries after the second world war .
despite some differences , the americans and british have drawn up a three-stage procedure , though much of the detail remains to be filled in , especially about the role of the un .
stage one is a period in which the us and uk military will retain security control , while day-to-day life -lrb- utilities , infrastructure , medical care and so on -rrb- is run by the newly formed us office of reconstruction and humanitarian aid -lrb- orha -rrb- .
nobody knows how long the troops will stay .
orha is led by retired general jay garner , and there are plans to divide the country up into three areas .
the baath party senior leadership would be removed , but lower level officials would be recruited to stay on .
stage two will see the formation of an interim iraqi administration -lrb- iia -rrb- .
it will have to be broad-based and include exiles .
those taking part will have to subscribe to iraqi territorial unity and to democratic aims .
it will not , however , have executive power but will have to work in liaison with orha and progressively take over various functions .
stage three will be the move , through elections of some form , to a representative government which will take over control .
no timeframe has been given .
the us deputy defence secretary paul wolfowitz said on sunday that it will take longer than six months .
" this is a complicated situation .
it will take more than that , " he said .
it is quite clear that the un will not be running iraq .
the us and uk hope to get the french , russians and germans on board war opponents demand post-war un role for iraq president bush 's national security adviser condoleezza rice said that " after giving life and blood for liberating iraq , the coalition expects to have the leading role . "
just where the un fits in has not been agreed .
the role of the un , dr rice says , has " yet to be determined . "
britain wants the un to specifically support the move to representative government .
the british government in particular would like the un to take the lead in organising a conference of iraqis in baghdad to approve the process .
it is also proposing a security council resolution wrapping this all up , and giving its blessing to at least the steps leading to representative government .
by bringing in the un , the uk hopes to get the french , russians and germans on board .
one issue clouding the policy has been the suspicion about american motives us head of new iraq administration waits in kuwait these countries opposed the war and do not want to legitimise any us or british occupation .
but they might want to legitimise an iraqi provisional government .
the united states talks more about the un in a supportive humanitarian role .
one cloud over the policy has been the suspicion about american motives .
the pentagon is in charge of ohra and there have been reports that it wanted to set up the iia , at least in the south , immediately .
it would reportedly have liked to give the lead role to iraqi exiles in the iraqi national congress under the leadership of ahmed chalabi .
he is close to the pentagon and is now talking of us troops staying in iraq for two years until elections are held .
some of his supporters are now being taken into southern iraq .
the washington post noted the criticism of the way policy has evolved : " the concern begins with the secrecy that has surrounded the planning process . "
tony blair will want to pin george bush down and ensure that it is as open and orderly as possible , with un backing at the appropriate time .
