but a trend of introducing culture to difficult social scenes is opening new doors for the disadvantaged . more than 600,000 people in germany under the age of 25 have never been gainfully employed , and more than half a million young people are in labor office schemes aimed at bridge the gap between joblessness and gainful employment .
but only one in three stands any real chance of picking up work on completion . those who have to fight hardest for their place in today 's job market are youngsters with little education , from difficult social backgrounds , or with less than perfect language skills .
and it is young people in these categories who are finding refuge under the creative wings of german artists , who also offer them a dose of much-needed self-confidence . reaching out one of the trendsetters in the effort to create a cross-over in culture and social work is internationally renowned artist thomas hirschhorn .
at last year 's documenta art exhibition in the german city of kassel , the swiss artist decided to create an installation in the city 's socially disadvantaged friedrich-wöhler estate .
using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .
hirschhorn paid the youngsters € 8.00 -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- per hour out of his own pocket , with no public funding .

many of those involved had never had to commit to anything before .
they learned to commit , to be punctual , reliable , to take responsibility , to work with one another and to solve conflicts without attacking one another , " gräber said . social romanticism for the most part , children in public housing complexes such as the friedrich-wöhler estate , live from social welfare , and foreign youths in particular often find hard to get a foot on germany 's employment and apprenticeship ladders .
schools in areas where there is a disproportionately high percentage of foreigners struggle with the linguistic imbalance of non-native speakers versus mother-tongue german pupils .
with little extra tuition on offer , the classroom climate is difficult for teachers and pupils alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bataille monument in kassel hirschhorn 's exhibit on the public housing was at the very least an opportunity for the international public to come into contact with a largely unfamiliar social environment .
and while some critics accused hirschhorn of using the youths to buy himself a flair for social romanticism , gräber and those who actually worked on the show , were full of praise for the project , which one young man said brought the area to life . feeding the demand hirschhorn 's installations clearly underlined the fact that when you take the offer of work to an employment-deprived zone , it not only increases curiosity , but also demand and a willingness to knuckle down and get on with it .
the artist does n't view himself as a social worker , but says he needed the youngsters in order to turn his plan into reality . unfortunately no matter how successful projects like hirschhorn 's are in terms of showing youths in difficult social situations that work is a way of participating in life , of being with other people and solving problems , the state offers them no financial backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaubühne in berlin another project by the schaubühne theater in berlin is helping in a similar fashion .

but a trend of introducing culture to difficult social scenes is opening new doors for the disadvantaged . more than 600,000 people in germany under the age of 25 have never been gainfully employed , and more than half a million young people are in labor office schemes aimed at bridge the gap between joblessness and gainful employment .
but only one in three stands any real chance of picking up work on completion . those who have to fight hardest for their place in today 's job market are youngsters with little education , from difficult social backgrounds , or with less than perfect language skills .
and it is young people in these categories who are finding refuge under the creative wings of german artists , who also offer them a dose of much-needed self-confidence . reaching out one of the trendsetters in the effort to create a cross-over in culture and social work is internationally renowned artist thomas hirschhorn .
at last year 's documenta art exhibition in the german city of kassel , the swiss artist decided to create an installation in the city 's socially disadvantaged friedrich-wöhler estate .
using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .
hirschhorn paid the youngsters € 8.00 -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- per hour out of his own pocket , with no public funding .
pit gräber , a youth social worker in the estate who oversaw the project felt it was a great opportunity for youngsters faced with a generally bleak future . " at the very least people learned what it means to work .
many of those involved had never had to commit to anything before .
they learned to commit , to be punctual , reliable , to take responsibility , to work with one another and to solve conflicts without attacking one another , " gräber said . social romanticism for the most part , children in public housing complexes such as the friedrich-wöhler estate , live from social welfare , and foreign youths in particular often find hard to get a foot on germany 's employment and apprenticeship ladders .
schools in areas where there is a disproportionately high percentage of foreigners struggle with the linguistic imbalance of non-native speakers versus mother-tongue german pupils .
with little extra tuition on offer , the classroom climate is difficult for teachers and pupils alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bataille monument in kassel hirschhorn 's exhibit on the public housing was at the very least an opportunity for the international public to come into contact with a largely unfamiliar social environment .
and while some critics accused hirschhorn of using the youths to buy himself a flair for social romanticism , gräber and those who actually worked on the show , were full of praise for the project , which one young man said brought the area to life . feeding the demand hirschhorn 's installations clearly underlined the fact that when you take the offer of work to an employment-deprived zone , it not only increases curiosity , but also demand and a willingness to knuckle down and get on with it .
the artist does n't view himself as a social worker , but says he needed the youngsters in order to turn his plan into reality . unfortunately no matter how successful projects like hirschhorn 's are in terms of showing youths in difficult social situations that work is a way of participating in life , of being with other people and solving problems , the state offers them no financial backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaubühne in berlin another project by the schaubühne theater in berlin is helping in a similar fashion .
the theater produces professional plays , which are performed during prime-time hours with young people from socially disadvantaged backgrounds .
the youth theatre group " die zwiefachen " , is made up of youngsters between the ages of 16 and 25 who have either moved out of home , run away from home or are refugees . although there is no financial benefit for the schaubühne itself , the project is confirmation of how important culture is as a means educating young people and improving their social situations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " me , inc .

germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .
some christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leaders agreed with their supporters .
“ this is definitely not a great success , ” said friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s finance expert -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .
apart from the bundestag , the reforms also have to be green-lighted in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , where the cdu holds the majority .

germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .

a few months later , the national interests of some eu members inflicted serious blows to the economic stability and growth pact .
over the past weekend , the same happened to the draft of the eu ’ s first constitution .
on tuesday , berlusconi , speaking before the european parliament , defended himself against attacks that he was personally responsible for the failure of the constitutional summit , which was supposed to be the highlight of his country ’ s council presidency " it is hard to escape the conclusion that this presidency and this igc have been a personal failure for the president of the european council , " one mep said .
despite the barrage of criticism , berlusconi remained sanguine as ever . ” the constitutional treaty is a goal that i ’ m sure we ’ ll manage to achieve , ” said berlusconi , who had placed the passage of the constitution as italy ’ s top priority upon assuming the presidency in june .

german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.12.2003 bremen leads bundesliga at winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonzalves ailton helped werder bremen get to the top .
german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

blackstone is offering € 32.50 for each celanese share .
both the celanese management and the kuwait petroleum corporation , which holds 29 percent of celanese stock , have given their backing to the offer .
the deal is believed to just the beginning of an acquisition spree for blackstone .
" we are definitely going to pursue other chemical assets in the region , " blackstone senior managing director chinh e. chu told reuters .
" we believe chemicals represent an attractive sector with the imminent rebound in the economy . "
the move represents the latest in a restructuring series for the ailing european chemicals industry , which is battling weak demand , high oil prices and a strong euro .
celanese was formed from the chemicals business of hoechst in 1999 ahead of the latter ’ s merger with the non-chemical business of rhone-poulenc . more briefs 17.12.2003 -pipe- german companies worried about their money in iraq 17.12.2003 -pipe- daimlerchrysler trial suspended amid new evidence 17.12.2003 -pipe- dollar slide may hit bundesbank profits 16.12.2003 -pipe- microsoft removes offending swastika 16.12.2003 -pipe- ig metall rejects longer work week 16.12.2003 -pipe- deutsche bank wins industry “ oscar ” 16.12.2003 -pipe- german christmas sales falling flat 15.12.2003 -pipe- eu commission expects economic growth radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .
some christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leaders agreed with their supporters .
“ this is definitely not a great success , ” said friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s finance expert -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .
apart from the bundestag , the reforms also have to be green-lighted in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , where the cdu holds the majority .

blackstone is offering € 32.50 for each celanese share .
both the celanese management and the kuwait petroleum corporation , which holds 29 percent of celanese stock , have given their backing to the offer .
the deal is believed to just the beginning of an acquisition spree for blackstone .
" we are definitely going to pursue other chemical assets in the region , " blackstone senior managing director chinh e. chu told reuters .
" we believe chemicals represent an attractive sector with the imminent rebound in the economy . "
the move represents the latest in a restructuring series for the ailing european chemicals industry , which is battling weak demand , high oil prices and a strong euro .
celanese was formed from the chemicals business of hoechst in 1999 ahead of the latter ’ s merger with the non-chemical business of rhone-poulenc . more briefs 17.12.2003 -pipe- german companies worried about their money in iraq 17.12.2003 -pipe- daimlerchrysler trial suspended amid new evidence 17.12.2003 -pipe- dollar slide may hit bundesbank profits 16.12.2003 -pipe- microsoft removes offending swastika 16.12.2003 -pipe- ig metall rejects longer work week 16.12.2003 -pipe- deutsche bank wins industry “ oscar ” 16.12.2003 -pipe- german christmas sales falling flat 15.12.2003 -pipe- eu commission expects economic growth radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .
apart from the bundestag , the reforms also have to be green-lighted in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , where the cdu holds the majority .
approval here is also all but guaranteed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect .

but a trend of introducing culture to difficult social scenes is opening new doors for the disadvantaged . more than 600,000 people in germany under the age of 25 have never been gainfully employed , and more than half a million young people are in labor office schemes aimed at bridge the gap between joblessness and gainful employment .
but only one in three stands any real chance of picking up work on completion . those who have to fight hardest for their place in today 's job market are youngsters with little education , from difficult social backgrounds , or with less than perfect language skills .
and it is young people in these categories who are finding refuge under the creative wings of german artists , who also offer them a dose of much-needed self-confidence . reaching out one of the trendsetters in the effort to create a cross-over in culture and social work is internationally renowned artist thomas hirschhorn .
at last year 's documenta art exhibition in the german city of kassel , the swiss artist decided to create an installation in the city 's socially disadvantaged friedrich-wöhler estate .
using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .
hirschhorn paid the youngsters € 8.00 -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- per hour out of his own pocket , with no public funding .
pit gräber , a youth social worker in the estate who oversaw the project felt it was a great opportunity for youngsters faced with a generally bleak future . " at the very least people learned what it means to work .
many of those involved had never had to commit to anything before .
they learned to commit , to be punctual , reliable , to take responsibility , to work with one another and to solve conflicts without attacking one another , " gräber said . social romanticism for the most part , children in public housing complexes such as the friedrich-wöhler estate , live from social welfare , and foreign youths in particular often find hard to get a foot on germany 's employment and apprenticeship ladders .
schools in areas where there is a disproportionately high percentage of foreigners struggle with the linguistic imbalance of non-native speakers versus mother-tongue german pupils .
with little extra tuition on offer , the classroom climate is difficult for teachers and pupils alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bataille monument in kassel hirschhorn 's exhibit on the public housing was at the very least an opportunity for the international public to come into contact with a largely unfamiliar social environment .
and while some critics accused hirschhorn of using the youths to buy himself a flair for social romanticism , gräber and those who actually worked on the show , were full of praise for the project , which one young man said brought the area to life . feeding the demand hirschhorn 's installations clearly underlined the fact that when you take the offer of work to an employment-deprived zone , it not only increases curiosity , but also demand and a willingness to knuckle down and get on with it .
the artist does n't view himself as a social worker , but says he needed the youngsters in order to turn his plan into reality . unfortunately no matter how successful projects like hirschhorn 's are in terms of showing youths in difficult social situations that work is a way of participating in life , of being with other people and solving problems , the state offers them no financial backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaubühne in berlin another project by the schaubühne theater in berlin is helping in a similar fashion .
the theater produces professional plays , which are performed during prime-time hours with young people from socially disadvantaged backgrounds .
the youth theatre group " die zwiefachen " , is made up of youngsters between the ages of 16 and 25 who have either moved out of home , run away from home or are refugees . although there is no financial benefit for the schaubühne itself , the project is confirmation of how important culture is as a means educating young people and improving their social situations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " me , inc .

and it is young people in these categories who are finding refuge under the creative wings of german artists , who also offer them a dose of much-needed self-confidence . reaching out one of the trendsetters in the effort to create a cross-over in culture and social work is internationally renowned artist thomas hirschhorn .
at last year 's documenta art exhibition in the german city of kassel , the swiss artist decided to create an installation in the city 's socially disadvantaged friedrich-wöhler estate .
using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .
hirschhorn paid the youngsters € 8.00 -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- per hour out of his own pocket , with no public funding .

schools in areas where there is a disproportionately high percentage of foreigners struggle with the linguistic imbalance of non-native speakers versus mother-tongue german pupils .
with little extra tuition on offer , the classroom climate is difficult for teachers and pupils alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bataille monument in kassel hirschhorn 's exhibit on the public housing was at the very least an opportunity for the international public to come into contact with a largely unfamiliar social environment .
and while some critics accused hirschhorn of using the youths to buy himself a flair for social romanticism , gräber and those who actually worked on the show , were full of praise for the project , which one young man said brought the area to life . feeding the demand hirschhorn 's installations clearly underlined the fact that when you take the offer of work to an employment-deprived zone , it not only increases curiosity , but also demand and a willingness to knuckle down and get on with it .

but a trend of introducing culture to difficult social scenes is opening new doors for the disadvantaged . more than 600,000 people in germany under the age of 25 have never been gainfully employed , and more than half a million young people are in labor office schemes aimed at bridge the gap between joblessness and gainful employment .
but only one in three stands any real chance of picking up work on completion . those who have to fight hardest for their place in today 's job market are youngsters with little education , from difficult social backgrounds , or with less than perfect language skills .
and it is young people in these categories who are finding refuge under the creative wings of german artists , who also offer them a dose of much-needed self-confidence . reaching out one of the trendsetters in the effort to create a cross-over in culture and social work is internationally renowned artist thomas hirschhorn .
at last year 's documenta art exhibition in the german city of kassel , the swiss artist decided to create an installation in the city 's socially disadvantaged friedrich-wöhler estate .
using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .
hirschhorn paid the youngsters € 8.00 -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- per hour out of his own pocket , with no public funding .

and while some critics accused hirschhorn of using the youths to buy himself a flair for social romanticism , gräber and those who actually worked on the show , were full of praise for the project , which one young man said brought the area to life . feeding the demand hirschhorn 's installations clearly underlined the fact that when you take the offer of work to an employment-deprived zone , it not only increases curiosity , but also demand and a willingness to knuckle down and get on with it .
the artist does n't view himself as a social worker , but says he needed the youngsters in order to turn his plan into reality . unfortunately no matter how successful projects like hirschhorn 's are in terms of showing youths in difficult social situations that work is a way of participating in life , of being with other people and solving problems , the state offers them no financial backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaubühne in berlin another project by the schaubühne theater in berlin is helping in a similar fashion .

the new twist to the two-week-old hearing came after daimlerchrysler handed over a set of documents papers to legal representatives of plaintiff and u.s. billionaire kirk kerkorian .
u.s. federal judge joseph farnan described the new evidence on tuesday as containing " in some instances very substantial testimony " .
the new documents are believed to contain statements by gary valade , who was chrysler ’ s chief financial officer at the time of the tie-up negotiations .
the 86-year-old kerkorian , who owned 13.7 percent of chrysler corp. shares before its $ 36 billion tie-up with daimler-benz , filed the case against the carmaker and its executives over the nature of the merger between german company daimler-benz and u.s. company chrysler .
kerkorian accuses daimlerchrysler and ceo jürgen schrempp of fraud and says a so-called " merger of equals " was actually a secret takeover by the german carmaker .

the us has been pressing strongly for the agreement , saying it needs the information for its fight against terrorism .
originally , the u.s. had demanded that the data should be kept for up to 50 years , but in the compromise deal , it will only store the information for 3.5 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.12.2003 german reform deal set for approval großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the talks over , germans are now expecting action .
germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .
some christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leaders agreed with their supporters .
“ this is definitely not a great success , ” said friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s finance expert -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .
apart from the bundestag , the reforms also have to be green-lighted in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , where the cdu holds the majority .
approval here is also all but guaranteed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect .

the newspaper estimated that iraq owed german companies debts amounting to 1.4 billion .
the paper said that a large part of the debt hardly appeared in the balance sheets of companies because several german-iraqi ventures from the 1970s and 80s didn ’ t fall under the so-called hermes export credits issued by the german government for projects and technologies considered unfit for domestic use .
according to the paper a large part of the iraqi debt was to be found in the german construction industry .

following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .
on tuesday he had to defend his eu presidency to the european parliament . measured against eu presidencies past , italy ’ s handling of its six-month term at the helm of the european council was less than ideal .
prime minister silvio berlusconi began his country ’ s presidency by comparing a german member of the european parliament to a concentration camp guard .
a few months later , the national interests of some eu members inflicted serious blows to the economic stability and growth pact .
over the past weekend , the same happened to the draft of the eu ’ s first constitution .
on tuesday , berlusconi , speaking before the european parliament , defended himself against attacks that he was personally responsible for the failure of the constitutional summit , which was supposed to be the highlight of his country ’ s council presidency " it is hard to escape the conclusion that this presidency and this igc have been a personal failure for the president of the european council , " one mep said .
despite the barrage of criticism , berlusconi remained sanguine as ever . ” the constitutional treaty is a goal that i ’ m sure we ’ ll manage to achieve , ” said berlusconi , who had placed the passage of the constitution as italy ’ s top priority upon assuming the presidency in june .
but many european parliamentarians are not so optimistic and have declared the failure to agree upon a new constitution as a major step back for europe .
there are also nasty rumors of retribution as six countries have proposed capping the eu budget in a move that would hurt spain and poland .
both countries ' unwilingness to compromise is seen by many as the main reason for the collapse of the summit .
a summit , berlusconi style some european editorialists and politicians have heaped scorn upon berlusconi personal style of managing the weekend summit .
although a new constitution is considered vital to the future of an expanding european union , the famously blunt italian leader , who owns the ac milan soccer club , reportedly opened the summit asking if they couldn ’ t “ talk about soccer and women ” instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then reportedly turned to german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo , berlusconi left -rrb- , on his fourth marriage , and asked if he would like to begin because “ he knows something about women . ”
although berlusconi often said during the summit he had solutions to the constitution deadlock hidden up his sleeve , he eventually failed to deliver . ” the eu council president made little jokes , but in leading complicated negotiations he proved to be less capable , ” wrote spain ’ s el pais newspaper , one of many to criticize berlusconi ’ s handling of the summit .
in italy 's defense but pat cox , the irish president of the european parliament , said the blame shouldn ’ t be placed only on berlusconi ’ s shoulders . ” italy isn ’ t to blame for the failure of the summit , ” cox , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january , said in a newspaper interview .
“ the common will to lead europe forward was missing over the weekend .
no other country in the role of the eu presidency could balance out this lack of european esprit . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .

defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .

it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 17.12.2003 german reform deal set for approval großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the talks over , germans are now expecting action .
germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .
some christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leaders agreed with their supporters .
“ this is definitely not a great success , ” said friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s finance expert -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .
apart from the bundestag , the reforms also have to be green-lighted in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , where the cdu holds the majority .
approval here is also all but guaranteed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .
but experts said the compromise will have little effect .

but only one in three stands any real chance of picking up work on completion . those who have to fight hardest for their place in today 's job market are youngsters with little education , from difficult social backgrounds , or with less than perfect language skills .
and it is young people in these categories who are finding refuge under the creative wings of german artists , who also offer them a dose of much-needed self-confidence . reaching out one of the trendsetters in the effort to create a cross-over in culture and social work is internationally renowned artist thomas hirschhorn .
at last year 's documenta art exhibition in the german city of kassel , the swiss artist decided to create an installation in the city 's socially disadvantaged friedrich-wöhler estate .
using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .
hirschhorn paid the youngsters € 8.00 -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- per hour out of his own pocket , with no public funding .
pit gräber , a youth social worker in the estate who oversaw the project felt it was a great opportunity for youngsters faced with a generally bleak future . " at the very least people learned what it means to work .
many of those involved had never had to commit to anything before .
they learned to commit , to be punctual , reliable , to take responsibility , to work with one another and to solve conflicts without attacking one another , " gräber said . social romanticism for the most part , children in public housing complexes such as the friedrich-wöhler estate , live from social welfare , and foreign youths in particular often find hard to get a foot on germany 's employment and apprenticeship ladders .
schools in areas where there is a disproportionately high percentage of foreigners struggle with the linguistic imbalance of non-native speakers versus mother-tongue german pupils .
with little extra tuition on offer , the classroom climate is difficult for teachers and pupils alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bataille monument in kassel hirschhorn 's exhibit on the public housing was at the very least an opportunity for the international public to come into contact with a largely unfamiliar social environment .
and while some critics accused hirschhorn of using the youths to buy himself a flair for social romanticism , gräber and those who actually worked on the show , were full of praise for the project , which one young man said brought the area to life . feeding the demand hirschhorn 's installations clearly underlined the fact that when you take the offer of work to an employment-deprived zone , it not only increases curiosity , but also demand and a willingness to knuckle down and get on with it .
the artist does n't view himself as a social worker , but says he needed the youngsters in order to turn his plan into reality . unfortunately no matter how successful projects like hirschhorn 's are in terms of showing youths in difficult social situations that work is a way of participating in life , of being with other people and solving problems , the state offers them no financial backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaubühne in berlin another project by the schaubühne theater in berlin is helping in a similar fashion .
the theater produces professional plays , which are performed during prime-time hours with young people from socially disadvantaged backgrounds .
the youth theatre group " die zwiefachen " , is made up of youngsters between the ages of 16 and 25 who have either moved out of home , run away from home or are refugees . although there is no financial benefit for the schaubühne itself , the project is confirmation of how important culture is as a means educating young people and improving their social situations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " me , inc .

plan could be victim of its own success the german government ’ s plan to get people back to work by becoming self-employed is showing signs of success .
but skyrocketing subsidies are causing doubts about the long-term future of the scheme .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.12.2003 bremen leads bundesliga at winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonzalves ailton helped werder bremen get to the top .
german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

but a trend of introducing culture to difficult social scenes is opening new doors for the disadvantaged . more than 600,000 people in germany under the age of 25 have never been gainfully employed , and more than half a million young people are in labor office schemes aimed at bridge the gap between joblessness and gainful employment .
but only one in three stands any real chance of picking up work on completion . those who have to fight hardest for their place in today 's job market are youngsters with little education , from difficult social backgrounds , or with less than perfect language skills .
and it is young people in these categories who are finding refuge under the creative wings of german artists , who also offer them a dose of much-needed self-confidence . reaching out one of the trendsetters in the effort to create a cross-over in culture and social work is internationally renowned artist thomas hirschhorn .
at last year 's documenta art exhibition in the german city of kassel , the swiss artist decided to create an installation in the city 's socially disadvantaged friedrich-wöhler estate .
using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .
hirschhorn paid the youngsters € 8.00 -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- per hour out of his own pocket , with no public funding .

many of those involved had never had to commit to anything before .
they learned to commit , to be punctual , reliable , to take responsibility , to work with one another and to solve conflicts without attacking one another , " gräber said . social romanticism for the most part , children in public housing complexes such as the friedrich-wöhler estate , live from social welfare , and foreign youths in particular often find hard to get a foot on germany 's employment and apprenticeship ladders .
schools in areas where there is a disproportionately high percentage of foreigners struggle with the linguistic imbalance of non-native speakers versus mother-tongue german pupils .
with little extra tuition on offer , the classroom climate is difficult for teachers and pupils alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bataille monument in kassel hirschhorn 's exhibit on the public housing was at the very least an opportunity for the international public to come into contact with a largely unfamiliar social environment .
and while some critics accused hirschhorn of using the youths to buy himself a flair for social romanticism , gräber and those who actually worked on the show , were full of praise for the project , which one young man said brought the area to life . feeding the demand hirschhorn 's installations clearly underlined the fact that when you take the offer of work to an employment-deprived zone , it not only increases curiosity , but also demand and a willingness to knuckle down and get on with it .
the artist does n't view himself as a social worker , but says he needed the youngsters in order to turn his plan into reality . unfortunately no matter how successful projects like hirschhorn 's are in terms of showing youths in difficult social situations that work is a way of participating in life , of being with other people and solving problems , the state offers them no financial backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaubühne in berlin another project by the schaubühne theater in berlin is helping in a similar fashion .

germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .
some christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leaders agreed with their supporters .
“ this is definitely not a great success , ” said friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s finance expert -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .
apart from the bundestag , the reforms also have to be green-lighted in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , where the cdu holds the majority .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.12.2003 bremen leads bundesliga at winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonzalves ailton helped werder bremen get to the top .
german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .
some christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leaders agreed with their supporters .
“ this is definitely not a great success , ” said friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s finance expert -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .
apart from the bundestag , the reforms also have to be green-lighted in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , where the cdu holds the majority .

germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .
some christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leaders agreed with their supporters .
“ this is definitely not a great success , ” said friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s finance expert -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .
apart from the bundestag , the reforms also have to be green-lighted in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , where the cdu holds the majority .

but a trend of introducing culture to difficult social scenes is opening new doors for the disadvantaged . more than 600,000 people in germany under the age of 25 have never been gainfully employed , and more than half a million young people are in labor office schemes aimed at bridge the gap between joblessness and gainful employment .
but only one in three stands any real chance of picking up work on completion . those who have to fight hardest for their place in today 's job market are youngsters with little education , from difficult social backgrounds , or with less than perfect language skills .
and it is young people in these categories who are finding refuge under the creative wings of german artists , who also offer them a dose of much-needed self-confidence . reaching out one of the trendsetters in the effort to create a cross-over in culture and social work is internationally renowned artist thomas hirschhorn .
at last year 's documenta art exhibition in the german city of kassel , the swiss artist decided to create an installation in the city 's socially disadvantaged friedrich-wöhler estate .
using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .
hirschhorn paid the youngsters € 8.00 -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- per hour out of his own pocket , with no public funding .

many of those involved had never had to commit to anything before .
they learned to commit , to be punctual , reliable , to take responsibility , to work with one another and to solve conflicts without attacking one another , " gräber said . social romanticism for the most part , children in public housing complexes such as the friedrich-wöhler estate , live from social welfare , and foreign youths in particular often find hard to get a foot on germany 's employment and apprenticeship ladders .
schools in areas where there is a disproportionately high percentage of foreigners struggle with the linguistic imbalance of non-native speakers versus mother-tongue german pupils .
with little extra tuition on offer , the classroom climate is difficult for teachers and pupils alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bataille monument in kassel hirschhorn 's exhibit on the public housing was at the very least an opportunity for the international public to come into contact with a largely unfamiliar social environment .
and while some critics accused hirschhorn of using the youths to buy himself a flair for social romanticism , gräber and those who actually worked on the show , were full of praise for the project , which one young man said brought the area to life . feeding the demand hirschhorn 's installations clearly underlined the fact that when you take the offer of work to an employment-deprived zone , it not only increases curiosity , but also demand and a willingness to knuckle down and get on with it .
the artist does n't view himself as a social worker , but says he needed the youngsters in order to turn his plan into reality . unfortunately no matter how successful projects like hirschhorn 's are in terms of showing youths in difficult social situations that work is a way of participating in life , of being with other people and solving problems , the state offers them no financial backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaubühne in berlin another project by the schaubühne theater in berlin is helping in a similar fashion .

using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.12.2003 bremen leads bundesliga at winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonzalves ailton helped werder bremen get to the top .
german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .

defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .
some christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leaders agreed with their supporters .
“ this is definitely not a great success , ” said friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s finance expert -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .
apart from the bundestag , the reforms also have to be green-lighted in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , where the cdu holds the majority .
approval here is also all but guaranteed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .

but a trend of introducing culture to difficult social scenes is opening new doors for the disadvantaged . more than 600,000 people in germany under the age of 25 have never been gainfully employed , and more than half a million young people are in labor office schemes aimed at bridge the gap between joblessness and gainful employment .
but only one in three stands any real chance of picking up work on completion . those who have to fight hardest for their place in today 's job market are youngsters with little education , from difficult social backgrounds , or with less than perfect language skills .
and it is young people in these categories who are finding refuge under the creative wings of german artists , who also offer them a dose of much-needed self-confidence . reaching out one of the trendsetters in the effort to create a cross-over in culture and social work is internationally renowned artist thomas hirschhorn .
at last year 's documenta art exhibition in the german city of kassel , the swiss artist decided to create an installation in the city 's socially disadvantaged friedrich-wöhler estate .
using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .
hirschhorn paid the youngsters € 8.00 -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- per hour out of his own pocket , with no public funding .
pit gräber , a youth social worker in the estate who oversaw the project felt it was a great opportunity for youngsters faced with a generally bleak future . " at the very least people learned what it means to work .
many of those involved had never had to commit to anything before .
they learned to commit , to be punctual , reliable , to take responsibility , to work with one another and to solve conflicts without attacking one another , " gräber said . social romanticism for the most part , children in public housing complexes such as the friedrich-wöhler estate , live from social welfare , and foreign youths in particular often find hard to get a foot on germany 's employment and apprenticeship ladders .
schools in areas where there is a disproportionately high percentage of foreigners struggle with the linguistic imbalance of non-native speakers versus mother-tongue german pupils .
with little extra tuition on offer , the classroom climate is difficult for teachers and pupils alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bataille monument in kassel hirschhorn 's exhibit on the public housing was at the very least an opportunity for the international public to come into contact with a largely unfamiliar social environment .
and while some critics accused hirschhorn of using the youths to buy himself a flair for social romanticism , gräber and those who actually worked on the show , were full of praise for the project , which one young man said brought the area to life . feeding the demand hirschhorn 's installations clearly underlined the fact that when you take the offer of work to an employment-deprived zone , it not only increases curiosity , but also demand and a willingness to knuckle down and get on with it .
the artist does n't view himself as a social worker , but says he needed the youngsters in order to turn his plan into reality . unfortunately no matter how successful projects like hirschhorn 's are in terms of showing youths in difficult social situations that work is a way of participating in life , of being with other people and solving problems , the state offers them no financial backing . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaubühne in berlin another project by the schaubühne theater in berlin is helping in a similar fashion .
the theater produces professional plays , which are performed during prime-time hours with young people from socially disadvantaged backgrounds .
the youth theatre group " die zwiefachen " , is made up of youngsters between the ages of 16 and 25 who have either moved out of home , run away from home or are refugees . although there is no financial benefit for the schaubühne itself , the project is confirmation of how important culture is as a means educating young people and improving their social situations . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " me , inc .

using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .
hirschhorn paid the youngsters € 8.00 -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- per hour out of his own pocket , with no public funding .

germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .
some christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leaders agreed with their supporters .
“ this is definitely not a great success , ” said friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s finance expert -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .
apart from the bundestag , the reforms also have to be green-lighted in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , where the cdu holds the majority .
approval here is also all but guaranteed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.12.2003 bremen leads bundesliga at winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonzalves ailton helped werder bremen get to the top .
german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .

bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .

“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .

ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .

defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .

germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .

“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.12.2003 bremen leads bundesliga at winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonzalves ailton helped werder bremen get to the top .
german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .
on tuesday he had to defend his eu presidency to the european parliament . measured against eu presidencies past , italy ’ s handling of its six-month term at the helm of the european council was less than ideal .
prime minister silvio berlusconi began his country ’ s presidency by comparing a german member of the european parliament to a concentration camp guard .
a few months later , the national interests of some eu members inflicted serious blows to the economic stability and growth pact .
over the past weekend , the same happened to the draft of the eu ’ s first constitution .
on tuesday , berlusconi , speaking before the european parliament , defended himself against attacks that he was personally responsible for the failure of the constitutional summit , which was supposed to be the highlight of his country ’ s council presidency " it is hard to escape the conclusion that this presidency and this igc have been a personal failure for the president of the european council , " one mep said .
despite the barrage of criticism , berlusconi remained sanguine as ever . ” the constitutional treaty is a goal that i ’ m sure we ’ ll manage to achieve , ” said berlusconi , who had placed the passage of the constitution as italy ’ s top priority upon assuming the presidency in june .
but many european parliamentarians are not so optimistic and have declared the failure to agree upon a new constitution as a major step back for europe .
there are also nasty rumors of retribution as six countries have proposed capping the eu budget in a move that would hurt spain and poland .
both countries ' unwilingness to compromise is seen by many as the main reason for the collapse of the summit .
a summit , berlusconi style some european editorialists and politicians have heaped scorn upon berlusconi personal style of managing the weekend summit .
although a new constitution is considered vital to the future of an expanding european union , the famously blunt italian leader , who owns the ac milan soccer club , reportedly opened the summit asking if they couldn ’ t “ talk about soccer and women ” instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then reportedly turned to german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo , berlusconi left -rrb- , on his fourth marriage , and asked if he would like to begin because “ he knows something about women . ”
although berlusconi often said during the summit he had solutions to the constitution deadlock hidden up his sleeve , he eventually failed to deliver . ” the eu council president made little jokes , but in leading complicated negotiations he proved to be less capable , ” wrote spain ’ s el pais newspaper , one of many to criticize berlusconi ’ s handling of the summit .
in italy 's defense but pat cox , the irish president of the european parliament , said the blame shouldn ’ t be placed only on berlusconi ’ s shoulders . ” italy isn ’ t to blame for the failure of the summit , ” cox , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january , said in a newspaper interview .
“ the common will to lead europe forward was missing over the weekend .
no other country in the role of the eu presidency could balance out this lack of european esprit . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .
on tuesday he had to defend his eu presidency to the european parliament . measured against eu presidencies past , italy ’ s handling of its six-month term at the helm of the european council was less than ideal .
prime minister silvio berlusconi began his country ’ s presidency by comparing a german member of the european parliament to a concentration camp guard .
a few months later , the national interests of some eu members inflicted serious blows to the economic stability and growth pact .
over the past weekend , the same happened to the draft of the eu ’ s first constitution .
on tuesday , berlusconi , speaking before the european parliament , defended himself against attacks that he was personally responsible for the failure of the constitutional summit , which was supposed to be the highlight of his country ’ s council presidency " it is hard to escape the conclusion that this presidency and this igc have been a personal failure for the president of the european council , " one mep said .
despite the barrage of criticism , berlusconi remained sanguine as ever . ” the constitutional treaty is a goal that i ’ m sure we ’ ll manage to achieve , ” said berlusconi , who had placed the passage of the constitution as italy ’ s top priority upon assuming the presidency in june .
but many european parliamentarians are not so optimistic and have declared the failure to agree upon a new constitution as a major step back for europe .
there are also nasty rumors of retribution as six countries have proposed capping the eu budget in a move that would hurt spain and poland .
both countries ' unwilingness to compromise is seen by many as the main reason for the collapse of the summit .
a summit , berlusconi style some european editorialists and politicians have heaped scorn upon berlusconi personal style of managing the weekend summit .
although a new constitution is considered vital to the future of an expanding european union , the famously blunt italian leader , who owns the ac milan soccer club , reportedly opened the summit asking if they couldn ’ t “ talk about soccer and women ” instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then reportedly turned to german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo , berlusconi left -rrb- , on his fourth marriage , and asked if he would like to begin because “ he knows something about women . ”
although berlusconi often said during the summit he had solutions to the constitution deadlock hidden up his sleeve , he eventually failed to deliver . ” the eu council president made little jokes , but in leading complicated negotiations he proved to be less capable , ” wrote spain ’ s el pais newspaper , one of many to criticize berlusconi ’ s handling of the summit .
in italy 's defense but pat cox , the irish president of the european parliament , said the blame shouldn ’ t be placed only on berlusconi ’ s shoulders . ” italy isn ’ t to blame for the failure of the summit , ” cox , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january , said in a newspaper interview .
“ the common will to lead europe forward was missing over the weekend .
no other country in the role of the eu presidency could balance out this lack of european esprit . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.12.2003 bremen leads bundesliga at winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonzalves ailton helped werder bremen get to the top .
german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .
some christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leaders agreed with their supporters .
“ this is definitely not a great success , ” said friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s finance expert -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .
apart from the bundestag , the reforms also have to be green-lighted in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , where the cdu holds the majority .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.12.2003 bremen leads bundesliga at winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonzalves ailton helped werder bremen get to the top .
german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .
some christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leaders agreed with their supporters .
“ this is definitely not a great success , ” said friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s finance expert -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .

it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .

“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .

felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.12.2003 bremen leads bundesliga at winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonzalves ailton helped werder bremen get to the top .
german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

following the collapse of the eu summit last weekend , italy ’ s silvio berlusconi has been criticized for not securing a deal on a new constitution .
on tuesday he had to defend his eu presidency to the european parliament . measured against eu presidencies past , italy ’ s handling of its six-month term at the helm of the european council was less than ideal .
prime minister silvio berlusconi began his country ’ s presidency by comparing a german member of the european parliament to a concentration camp guard .
a few months later , the national interests of some eu members inflicted serious blows to the economic stability and growth pact .
over the past weekend , the same happened to the draft of the eu ’ s first constitution .
on tuesday , berlusconi , speaking before the european parliament , defended himself against attacks that he was personally responsible for the failure of the constitutional summit , which was supposed to be the highlight of his country ’ s council presidency " it is hard to escape the conclusion that this presidency and this igc have been a personal failure for the president of the european council , " one mep said .
despite the barrage of criticism , berlusconi remained sanguine as ever . ” the constitutional treaty is a goal that i ’ m sure we ’ ll manage to achieve , ” said berlusconi , who had placed the passage of the constitution as italy ’ s top priority upon assuming the presidency in june .
but many european parliamentarians are not so optimistic and have declared the failure to agree upon a new constitution as a major step back for europe .
there are also nasty rumors of retribution as six countries have proposed capping the eu budget in a move that would hurt spain and poland .
both countries ' unwilingness to compromise is seen by many as the main reason for the collapse of the summit .
a summit , berlusconi style some european editorialists and politicians have heaped scorn upon berlusconi personal style of managing the weekend summit .
although a new constitution is considered vital to the future of an expanding european union , the famously blunt italian leader , who owns the ac milan soccer club , reportedly opened the summit asking if they couldn ’ t “ talk about soccer and women ” instead .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : he then reportedly turned to german chancellor gerhard schröder -lrb- photo , berlusconi left -rrb- , on his fourth marriage , and asked if he would like to begin because “ he knows something about women . ”
although berlusconi often said during the summit he had solutions to the constitution deadlock hidden up his sleeve , he eventually failed to deliver . ” the eu council president made little jokes , but in leading complicated negotiations he proved to be less capable , ” wrote spain ’ s el pais newspaper , one of many to criticize berlusconi ’ s handling of the summit .
in italy 's defense but pat cox , the irish president of the european parliament , said the blame shouldn ’ t be placed only on berlusconi ’ s shoulders . ” italy isn ’ t to blame for the failure of the summit , ” cox , whose country will assume the eu presidency in january , said in a newspaper interview .
“ the common will to lead europe forward was missing over the weekend .
no other country in the role of the eu presidency could balance out this lack of european esprit . ” send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu constitution summit fails eu leaders failed to work out differences over a new constitution for europe on saturday , despite a last-ditch effort by italian prime minister silvio berlusconi for a compromise over voting rights .

german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.12.2003 opting for art instead of unemployment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artist thomas hirschhorn 's " bataille sculpture " with unemployment figures in germany still staggeringly high , too many young germans are stuck on welfare .
but a trend of introducing culture to difficult social scenes is opening new doors for the disadvantaged . more than 600,000 people in germany under the age of 25 have never been gainfully employed , and more than half a million young people are in labor office schemes aimed at bridge the gap between joblessness and gainful employment .
but only one in three stands any real chance of picking up work on completion . those who have to fight hardest for their place in today 's job market are youngsters with little education , from difficult social backgrounds , or with less than perfect language skills .
and it is young people in these categories who are finding refuge under the creative wings of german artists , who also offer them a dose of much-needed self-confidence . reaching out one of the trendsetters in the effort to create a cross-over in culture and social work is internationally renowned artist thomas hirschhorn .
at last year 's documenta art exhibition in the german city of kassel , the swiss artist decided to create an installation in the city 's socially disadvantaged friedrich-wöhler estate .
using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .
hirschhorn paid the youngsters € 8.00 -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- per hour out of his own pocket , with no public funding .
pit gräber , a youth social worker in the estate who oversaw the project felt it was a great opportunity for youngsters faced with a generally bleak future . " at the very least people learned what it means to work .
many of those involved had never had to commit to anything before .
they learned to commit , to be punctual , reliable , to take responsibility , to work with one another and to solve conflicts without attacking one another , " gräber said . social romanticism for the most part , children in public housing complexes such as the friedrich-wöhler estate , live from social welfare , and foreign youths in particular often find hard to get a foot on germany 's employment and apprenticeship ladders .
schools in areas where there is a disproportionately high percentage of foreigners struggle with the linguistic imbalance of non-native speakers versus mother-tongue german pupils .

germany ’ s parliament is expected to approve sweeping tax and welfare reforms on friday after government and opposition officials hammered out the details .
but most germans don ’ t think it will aid the economic recovery . “ we did it , ” franz müntefering , parliament floor leader of the ruling social democrats , said after a final meeting of a mediation committee on the reforms late on tuesday .
the deal will leave an extra € 15 billion -lrb- $ 18.5 billion -rrb- in taxpayers pockets starting next year – about € 568 for a family with a household income of € 30,000 . a few hundred euros extra per year seems to be less than most germans had hoped for , though : a poll published by the newsmagazine stern on wednesday showed that 45 percent had expected to get to keep more money in 2004 . an even greater number , 63 percent , said they didn ’ t believe the reforms will fuel economic growth or lead to the creation of more jobs .
conservative voters are slightly more unhappy with the final result than social democratic ones . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : friedrich merz is n't happy with the compromise .
some christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- leaders agreed with their supporters .
“ this is definitely not a great success , ” said friedrich merz , the cdu ’ s finance expert -lrb- photo -rrb- .
“ it ’ s a compromise based on the smallest common denominator .
we couldn ’ t do more , considering the government ’ s messy proposal . ”
merz added that he plans to introduce a bill based on his own tax reform plan early next year . confusion on amount of tax cut while other cdu leaders said the deal clearly bore their party ’ s signature , they had to make last-minute concessions in one crucial area : a calculating mistake added € 1.2 billion to the tax cut after both sides had already announced the framework of the deal on monday . this means that 30 percent of the cut will have to be financed by taking on new debt .
the opposition christian democrats grudgingly accepted this despite insisting earlier that only 25 percent of the tax cut should be paid for by increasing germany ’ s debt . government ’ s own majority not guaranteed while german chancellor gerhard schröder can expect the reform compromise to pass germany ’ s lower house , the bundestag , it ’ s still unclear whether his governing coalition of social democrats and greens could do so on its own . schröder only has a wafer-thin majority of four votes and at least five parliamentarians have already announced they will vote against the reforms .
they said that they can not support plans to weaken workers ’ protection from getting fired . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : welfare recipients will have to accept any legal job in the future .
under the deal , welfare recipients will also be required to accept any legal job offered to them .
along with other subsidies , those for homeowners and commuters will be reduced to help pay for the tax cut . the chancellor , quick to threaten coalition members with resigning should they fail to support him in the past , has not pulled out this trump card so far .
apart from the bundestag , the reforms also have to be green-lighted in germany ’ s upper house , the bundesrat , where the cdu holds the majority .
approval here is also all but guaranteed . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de experts doubt reform deal will jump-start economy germans will pay less taxes by january after government and opposition leaders agreed early monday on a reform package to boost the country ’ s struggling economy .

tax breaks for soccer stars and hockey players on the dole makaay boosts bayern 's bid for euro glory dortmund faces cash crunch culture & lifestyle -pipe- 17.12.2003 bremen leads bundesliga at winter break großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gonzalves ailton helped werder bremen get to the top .
german soccer prepares for its winter hibernation this week as the top clubs complete their schedules on wednesday night .
one thing won ’ t change whatever the results - werder bremen will start 2004 as league leaders . while the big guns of old continue to experience a campaign full of dramatic hits and embarrassing misses this time around , new challengers for the championship title have found their stride and look capable of withstanding the long slog towards the season ’ s end in the second half of the season . this year ’ s bundesliga “ herbst meister , ” the club that sits atop of the league as the winter break begins , is werder bremen , a team many may feel to be an unlikely candidate for christmas pacesetters .
bremen proved to be too strong for hansa rostock on tuesday night , overpowering the east german side in a 3-0 rout . ailton keeps scoring , bremen keep rising goals from the increasingly prolific striker gonzalves ailton , krisztian lisztes and valerien ishmael secured the top spot for bremen at the year end , irrespective of the final results to come on wednesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ailton looks for divine intervention in his quest for the championship .
while hope among supporters is high , title talk is muted in northern germany as the flying bremen stars continue to focus on the task at hand .
“ our principal goal is still a place in the next champions league , ” ailton told dw-world .
“ in the bundesliga , we are considered outsiders .
it ’ s good for us that bayern munich and leverkusen are favorites . ” but with ailton in such blistering form , the possibilities of reward come the season ’ s end can not be discounted , even if the only outcome is a personal trophy for the brazilian forward , currently out on his own in the scoring stakes with 16 goals so far . “ for the past two or three seasons , i ’ ve had the top scorer title in my sights , ” the bremen striker admitted .
“ but it hasn ’ t happened yet .
i am already playing a lot better than last season and without elber -lrb- ex-bayern munich striker and last year ’ s goal king -rrb- in the league , maybe my chances are better .
i have trained harder with the specific purpose of being the top scorer this year . ” team spirit drives bremen forward bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team spirit at bremen in central to their success .
ailton believes that the spirit at werder bremen is one of the team ’ s strongest advantages over a number of their rivals who have dominated column inches in the german press of late due to outbursts of disunity .
the brazilian is in no doubt from where bremen gets its winning attitude .
“ the players .
it is a wonderful group , without rivalry among the forwards , or best players , defenders ... we hold together .
the mood among us is very friendly .
and this unity contributes to our achievement . ” despite a driving team , the task in hand for the bundesliga defenses is to find a way to handle the livewire ailton .
when competition resumes after the winter break , the championship contenders will be keeping an eye on the brazilian ’ s exploits as they continue to stake their claim and push hard for the championship shield . bayern send warning to pretenders bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern make it known that they wo n't give up the title without a fight .
defending champions bayern munich sent out a typically bullish statement of intent on tuesday by thrashing sc freiburg 6-0 away from home .
after a series of what can only be described as hiccups on their march towards a record 19th championship , munich dispatched the lowly fellow southerners in a romping display which got six separate bayern stars on the score sheet .
the victory still leaves munich four points behind bremen . stuttgart , leverkusen keep pressure on championship runners-up vfb stuttgart are once again in the running , proving that their second place finish last season was no fluke .
while also reaching the dizzy heights of the knock-out stages of the champions league , stuttgart are still keeping pace with the leaders .
felix magath ’ s third placed side will leapfrog munich into second at the break if they beat bayer leverkusen , currently in fourth . however , such is the lack of breathing space at the top , leverkusen themselves could mathematically take the number two slot if they win , but it will have to be with a margin of six clear goals against a defense that has only let in four domestic goals so far this season . top four opening up an ominous gap bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund 's head coach matthias sammer .
the championship is looking increasingly like a four-horse race with fifth-place vfb bochum way off the pace with 25 points , seven behind leverkusen before wednesday night ’ s games .
meanwhile , the crisis for 2001/02 champions borussia dortmund continues with a string of terrible results rooting the former european champions to sixth place with only a uefa cup qualifying slot as a realistic target at this stage of play . the bundesliga season will resume on jan .

but a trend of introducing culture to difficult social scenes is opening new doors for the disadvantaged . more than 600,000 people in germany under the age of 25 have never been gainfully employed , and more than half a million young people are in labor office schemes aimed at bridge the gap between joblessness and gainful employment .
but only one in three stands any real chance of picking up work on completion . those who have to fight hardest for their place in today 's job market are youngsters with little education , from difficult social backgrounds , or with less than perfect language skills .
and it is young people in these categories who are finding refuge under the creative wings of german artists , who also offer them a dose of much-needed self-confidence . reaching out one of the trendsetters in the effort to create a cross-over in culture and social work is internationally renowned artist thomas hirschhorn .
at last year 's documenta art exhibition in the german city of kassel , the swiss artist decided to create an installation in the city 's socially disadvantaged friedrich-wöhler estate .
using the french philosopher georges bataille as his inspiration , he erected a sculpture , a library containing the philosopher 's work , a tv studio and a snack bar . a group of unemployed and foreign youths , some with criminal records , were paid to help erect his work and subsequently show visitors around and explain the installation to them .
hirschhorn paid the youngsters € 8.00 -lrb- $ 9.60 -rrb- per hour out of his own pocket , with no public funding .
pit gräber , a youth social worker in the estate who oversaw the project felt it was a great opportunity for youngsters faced with a generally bleak future . " at the very least people learned what it means to work .
many of those involved had never had to commit to anything before .
they learned to commit , to be punctual , reliable , to take responsibility , to work with one another and to solve conflicts without attacking one another , " gräber said . social romanticism for the most part , children in public housing complexes such as the friedrich-wöhler estate , live from social welfare , and foreign youths in particular often find hard to get a foot on germany 's employment and apprenticeship ladders .
schools in areas where there is a disproportionately high percentage of foreigners struggle with the linguistic imbalance of non-native speakers versus mother-tongue german pupils .
with little extra tuition on offer , the classroom climate is difficult for teachers and pupils alike . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bataille monument in kassel hirschhorn 's exhibit on the public housing was at the very least an opportunity for the international public to come into contact with a largely unfamiliar social environment .

taiwan health officials say the man , 44 , might have contracted the pneumonia-like disease on 5 december during an experiment on sars .
it is the island 's first case since it was dropped from a global list of sars-infected areas in july .
sars killed over 800 people and infected as many as 8,000 in a world-wide outbreak earlier this year .
taiwan had recorded more than 300 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome and 37 people died directly from the virus , according to the world health organisation -lrb- who -rrb- .
around the same number of deaths in the country were related to sars .

" right now , he 's the only one who 's been infected , " taiwan 's health minister chen chien-jen told reporters at a news conference on wednesday .
health officials said the researcher attended a conference in singapore for four days earlier this month and developed a fever on 10 december after returning to taiwan .
initially he thought he had the flu , but x-ray examination on tuesday showed he had pneumonia .
he was then tested for sars and the results were positive .

health officials said the researcher attended a conference in singapore for four days earlier this month and developed a fever on 10 december after returning to taiwan .
initially he thought he had the flu , but x-ray examination on tuesday showed he had pneumonia .
he was then tested for sars and the results were positive .
television stations showed footage of the man being transported to taipei 's hoping hospital in a special ambulance .
authorities in singapore said that so far there were no signs that the taiwanese researcher had infected anyone there , but an investigation has been launched .
taiwan was badly affected by the sars outbreak earlier this year , the bbc 's louisa lim in beijing says .
hospitals failed to manage infected patients properly and the virus spread quickly .
sars is believed to have originated in southern china in november last year .
researchers have warned it could return in the cooler winter months .

money talk by anna bowes independent financial adviser , chase de vere the treasury has announced that the amount that people will be allowed to save tax-free is to fall .
an expert explains the changes and what strategy people should adopt .
when individual savings accounts -lrb- isas -rrb- were introduced by gordon brown in 1999 the amount that could be paid in was set at £ 7,000 .
at the end of the first year the treasury said that the tax-free savings allowance would fall to £ 5,000 .
however , the chancellor later decided to extend the period that the £ 7,000 limit would continue until april 2006 .
in the recently published pre-budget report the treasury reiterated that the limit would revert to £ 5,000 in 2006 .
the reduction of the amount that can be invested into a mini cash isa will be a blow for many savers but under the government proposals - to be opened up to consultation with the finance industry - how the money can be invested in an isa is to be simplified .
current limits under current rules , a maxi isa allows investors to put up to £ 7,000 into shares , but it can also be broken down to allow up to £ 3,000 to go into cash savings and £ 1,000 into insurance .
a mini isa enables investors to split up their money into three separate cash , share and insurance isas .
the limits are £ 3,000 in cash , £ 3,000 in shares and £ 1,000 in insurance .
under the new rules there will only be two elements to a mini isa - £ 1,000 maximum in cash and £ 4,000 into stocks and shares .
the insurance mini isa - which has n't proved popular - is being scrapped .
as for maxi isas , people can use their full tax-free allowance of £ 5,000 to invest in either stocks or shares , medium-term stakeholder products , life insurance or collective investments .
isa limits from 2006 maxi isa : £ 5,000 to be invested in either stocks or shares , medium-term stakeholder products , life insurance or collective investments .
alternatively , up to £ 1,000 can be held in cash with the remainder in stocks and shares with one provider mini isa : £ 4,000 in stocks or shares or £ 1,000 in cash , can be held with two different providers the reduction of the amount that can be invested into a mini cash isa will be a blow for many savers .
many people who have paid into a mini cash isas may not have dreamed of investing in personal equity plan -lrb- pep -rrb- - the predecessor of isas .
what is more , the innovation of mini cash isas came at just the right time , as savings accounts have outperformed shares in recent years .
strategy select mini cash isa rates intelligent finance 4.35 % portman building society 4.35 % northern rock 4.20 % kent reliance building society 4.16 % variable rate accounts only source : chase de vere -lrb- correct at 16/12/03 -rrb- it is really important to use the higher allowance while you still can .
it is imperative that any savings that are languishing in taxpaying accounts are transferred into a mini cash isa - if you have not yet used your isa allowance for this tax year .
as for the stocks and shares isa allowance , there is a major health warning .
you should never use the stocks and shares isa allowance just for the sake of it .
stock market investment can be risky and it has to be right for you .

money talk by anna bowes independent financial adviser , chase de vere the treasury has announced that the amount that people will be allowed to save tax-free is to fall .
an expert explains the changes and what strategy people should adopt .
when individual savings accounts -lrb- isas -rrb- were introduced by gordon brown in 1999 the amount that could be paid in was set at £ 7,000 .
at the end of the first year the treasury said that the tax-free savings allowance would fall to £ 5,000 .
however , the chancellor later decided to extend the period that the £ 7,000 limit would continue until april 2006 .
in the recently published pre-budget report the treasury reiterated that the limit would revert to £ 5,000 in 2006 .
the reduction of the amount that can be invested into a mini cash isa will be a blow for many savers but under the government proposals - to be opened up to consultation with the finance industry - how the money can be invested in an isa is to be simplified .
current limits under current rules , a maxi isa allows investors to put up to £ 7,000 into shares , but it can also be broken down to allow up to £ 3,000 to go into cash savings and £ 1,000 into insurance .
a mini isa enables investors to split up their money into three separate cash , share and insurance isas .
the limits are £ 3,000 in cash , £ 3,000 in shares and £ 1,000 in insurance .
under the new rules there will only be two elements to a mini isa - £ 1,000 maximum in cash and £ 4,000 into stocks and shares .
the insurance mini isa - which has n't proved popular - is being scrapped .
as for maxi isas , people can use their full tax-free allowance of £ 5,000 to invest in either stocks or shares , medium-term stakeholder products , life insurance or collective investments .

many people who have paid into a mini cash isas may not have dreamed of investing in personal equity plan -lrb- pep -rrb- - the predecessor of isas .

a medical researcher who was investigating the virus has been hospitalised , health officials said .
news that the man had recently returned from a conference in singapore sent asian airline stocks into a tailspin , with many down more than 2 % .
stock markets in tokyo , hong kong , taiwan and singapore were all pulled lower on wednesday morning as a result .
' irrational disruption ' shares in singapore airlines fell 2.6 % in morning trade , while japan 's biggest carrier , japan airlines dropped 3.5 % ; all nippon airways shed 2.6 % .
cathay pacific , the hong kong based carrier , saw its stock drop 2.36 % .
stocks in china eastern and china southern were both lower in hong kong .
the region 's major stock markets all felt the impact , although they stabilised by late morning as panic subsided .
in taiwan , the ministry of finance said it was ready to support stock prices against " irrational disruptions " after the leading stock index fell steeply - down more than 2 % .
shares in taiwan-based china airlines , the airline used by the sars patient to return from singapore , had shed 3.6 % , while eva airways dived 4.1 % .
tokyo 's benchmark nikkei index fell nearly 2 % , though the weak dollar and upward pressure on the yen also played a role .
singapore 's straits times index was 1.8 % lower at the end of morning trade .
in hong kong , the hang seng shed 0.7 % but rallied in during the afternoon session .
china 's main stock indexes showed no ill-effects .
asian airlines ' finances are still recovering from the sars outbreak earlier this year , which forced carriers to cancel many flights as travel into the region slowed to a trickle .
traders said stock prices would recover fast if the infection proved to be an isolated case .
" the market is far more prepared this time and can rebound strongly if indeed the authorities confirm it is an isolated case , " said gabriel yap of kim ong asia brokerage in singapore .

the first steps in constructing the 50m cardiff international swimming pool were taken on wednesday , as the huge 10-year project began in earnest .
when complete , the sports village will also be the new home to the cardiff devils ice hockey team and a £ 14m " snow dome " .
a hotel , conference facility and casino , as well as shops , pubs , and 450 apartments , are also planned for the development , which will create thousands of jobs .
it is the latest major construction project in cardiff bay , alongside the £ 104m wales millennium centre and the £ 41m welsh assembly debating chamber , as well as several waterfront housing developments .
last year , a welsh assembly investigation expressed concern that the sports village may not provide the best value for public money .
the sports village will regenerate the formerly derelict ferry road site on the waterfront of the 500-acre lake created by the cardiff bay barrage .
work on the cardiff international pool is expected to be completed by the end of 2005 .
swimming facilities in cardiff were reduced when the empire pool - were the empire games were held in the 1950s - was demolished in 1998 to make way for the city 's millennium stadium and the millennium plaza leisure complex .
the scheme has been granted outline planning permission and the welsh assembly , the welsh development agency and the environment agency are all involved in the project .
cardiff council leader russell goodway , said he was delighted that work was " now visibly under way " .
" this is a major step forward and demonstrates the council 's commitment to seeing that the project , which is of huge economic and social benefit to the city , goes ahead , " he said .
councillor marion drake , deputy leader for culture and sport , said she believed the facilities would stand comparison with the best in europe .
" this is an important day for all of us in cardiff , with the promise of access to a first class sport and leisure complex in less than two years ' time , " she said .

the first steps in constructing the 50m cardiff international swimming pool were taken on wednesday , as the huge 10-year project began in earnest .
when complete , the sports village will also be the new home to the cardiff devils ice hockey team and a £ 14m " snow dome " .
a hotel , conference facility and casino , as well as shops , pubs , and 450 apartments , are also planned for the development , which will create thousands of jobs .
it is the latest major construction project in cardiff bay , alongside the £ 104m wales millennium centre and the £ 41m welsh assembly debating chamber , as well as several waterfront housing developments .
last year , a welsh assembly investigation expressed concern that the sports village may not provide the best value for public money .

work on the cardiff international pool is expected to be completed by the end of 2005 .

the scheme has been granted outline planning permission and the welsh assembly , the welsh development agency and the environment agency are all involved in the project .
cardiff council leader russell goodway , said he was delighted that work was " now visibly under way " .
" this is a major step forward and demonstrates the council 's commitment to seeing that the project , which is of huge economic and social benefit to the city , goes ahead , " he said .
councillor marion drake , deputy leader for culture and sport , said she believed the facilities would stand comparison with the best in europe .
" this is an important day for all of us in cardiff , with the promise of access to a first class sport and leisure complex in less than two years ' time , " she said .

tensions between beijing and taipei have been fuelled by mr chen 's plan to hold a referendum asking china to remove its missiles targeting taiwan .
china is worried that a vote could be seen as a move towards independence .
mr chen raised the stakes further on wednesday , saying he would even deem chinese missile tests provocative .
in an interview with the uk newspaper the financial times on wednesday , he warned china that if it conducts missile tests around taiwan , as it did in 1996 , that would be seen as an attack .
mr chen has said he is justified in holding a referendum on china 's missiles because he believes the island is under imminent attack from the mainland but china also appeared to raise the stakes .
li weiyi , spokesman for china 's taiwan affairs office , said at a press conference : " in the face of outrageous splittist activities , we must make necessary preparations to resolutely crush taiwan independence plots " .
he warned mr chen that he was gambling " with the immediate interests of taiwan compatriots " in bidding for a referendum on 20 march , the date of next year 's presidential elections , in an attempt to get re-elected .
" this is very immoral , " he said .
despite the fact taiwan and china are publicly exchanging insults , they are still talking about laying on more charter flights , the bbc 's correspondent in shanghai , francis markus , says .
the flights were started last year to ferry thousands of taiwanese businessmen based in china home for the lunar new year .
it is another sign of the forces of economic integration and political nationalism pulling in opposite directions , and both sides will have to manage that tension successfully if conflict is to be ultimately averted , our correspondent says .

four areas have been chosen to test the technology which uses radio signals to transmit a fast , always-on connection .
" their experience could help bt and our partners to extend broadband and all its benefits to many more communities across the uk , " said bt retail 's boss , pierre danon .
the trials are part of bt 's pledge to offer broadband to all of uk by 2005 .
through the air the 105 households in the trials , from ballingry in fife , scotland , pwllheli in wales , porthleven in cornwall and campsie in northern ireland , will try out the technology for three months .
the broadband connection will offer a similar speed to adsl , -lrb- asymmetric digital subscriber line -rrb- , which is usually 512kbps .
bt says it wants broadband for everyone the technology being tested sends the broadband signal using radio waves , without the need for wires , similar to wi-fi technology .
the signal travels from a base station to a home computer through a low-power antenna .
it is similar to a satellite dish , but is smaller and diamond-shaped and fits onto the side of a house .
out of reach mr danon reaffirmed bt 's commitment to reaching 100 % broadband coverage for every uk community by 2005 .
" we want to make broadband services available to everyone in the uk , whether they live in town centres or rural communities should be irrelevant .
" the benefits of broadband are extensive and we are working hard to make this target a reality . "
the trial areas are among those throughout the uk which can not get traditional adsl broadband .
this is because either they are too far from adsl-enabled telephone exchanges , or because the " trigger level " has not been reached .
bt upgrades a telephone exchange for adsl when a trigger level is achieved , which means a certain number of people say they want it .
currently , there are 600 small telephone exchanges which have not even had this level set , which account for about 100,000 households .
bt announced last month that it had set triggers for 2,300 more exchanges across the uk , potentially covering two million homes and businesses .

the government , having faced down opponents of primary school tests , is publishing separately this year test result tables for 14 year olds .
they show grammar schools do very well by their pupils .
but the tables have been scorned by head teachers ' leaders as flawed , and failing to have any useful purpose .
the government says that the tables are " vital " to monitoring the progress of teenagers .
there has been longstanding concern about the underachievement of pupils in the early years of secondary school .
' flawed ' and the government has introduced another layer of school performance tables , this time for 14 year olds , to identify where intervention is necessary before pupils take formal exams .
the same information - showing test results and a " value added " measure - was also published last year .
what is new this year is the publication date .
ministers have deliberately separated these test results from the gcse results - due out in a month 's time - to highlight them .
school standards minister david miliband said : " i believe that regular national testing helps support this improvement in schools . "
" it provides a national benchmark for standards and helps ensure that children in poorer areas do not get left behind . "
the tables , which do not include the independent schools that dominate the top of the gcse rankings , show grammar schools performing strongly .
among local authorities , rutland , north yorkshire , buckinghamshire and kingston-upon-thames were at the top .
at the other end of the table , the city of nottingham , southwark , tower hamlets and islington had the worst results .
' spurious rank ' but head teachers have been scathing about the introduction of more league tables .
john dunford , general secretary of the secondary heads association , said the school rankings were " flawed , misleading and unnecessary " .
" the league tables present a spurious rank order of schools , when the statistics on which they are based can not sustain such detailed comparisons , " said mr dunford .
he says it is well known that brighter pupils do well between the ages of 11 and 14 - so it is no surprise to see the grammar schools giving a good showing .
david hart , general secretary of the national association of head teachers , said : " performance tables for 14 year olds are an unnecessary irrelevance .
they serve no useful purpose when the tests themselves are of a totally different order to gcses or a-levels . "
' poisonous thorn ' nationally there were improvements in the numbers of pupils reaching the expected levels , in english -lrb- up by 2 % -rrb- , maths -lrb- up by 4 % -rrb- and science -lrb- up by 1 % -rrb- .
shadow education secretary tim yeo said : " these results show that the very schools labour has been undermining for 30 years continue to perform outstandingly well .
" crucially these schools do best at raising the performance of all levels of pupils regardless of their ability .
" we are determined that not a single grammar school will close .
liberal democrat education spokesman phil willis said : " league tables skew parent choice , fail to give informed choice and , most serious of all , condemn children with low performance to an educational underclass .
" while ministers continue to place their faith in school performance tables , this research concludes that they are little more than a poisonous thorn wedged in the side of educational progress . "

the government , having faced down opponents of primary school tests , is publishing separately this year test result tables for 14 year olds .
they show grammar schools do very well by their pupils .
but the tables have been scorned by head teachers ' leaders as flawed , and failing to have any useful purpose .
the government says that the tables are " vital " to monitoring the progress of teenagers .
there has been longstanding concern about the underachievement of pupils in the early years of secondary school .
' flawed ' and the government has introduced another layer of school performance tables , this time for 14 year olds , to identify where intervention is necessary before pupils take formal exams .
the same information - showing test results and a " value added " measure - was also published last year .
what is new this year is the publication date .
ministers have deliberately separated these test results from the gcse results - due out in a month 's time - to highlight them .
school standards minister david miliband said : " i believe that regular national testing helps support this improvement in schools . "
" it provides a national benchmark for standards and helps ensure that children in poorer areas do not get left behind . "
the tables , which do not include the independent schools that dominate the top of the gcse rankings , show grammar schools performing strongly .
among local authorities , rutland , north yorkshire , buckinghamshire and kingston-upon-thames were at the top .
at the other end of the table , the city of nottingham , southwark , tower hamlets and islington had the worst results .
' spurious rank ' but head teachers have been scathing about the introduction of more league tables .
john dunford , general secretary of the secondary heads association , said the school rankings were " flawed , misleading and unnecessary " .
" the league tables present a spurious rank order of schools , when the statistics on which they are based can not sustain such detailed comparisons , " said mr dunford .
he says it is well known that brighter pupils do well between the ages of 11 and 14 - so it is no surprise to see the grammar schools giving a good showing .
david hart , general secretary of the national association of head teachers , said : " performance tables for 14 year olds are an unnecessary irrelevance .
they serve no useful purpose when the tests themselves are of a totally different order to gcses or a-levels . "
' poisonous thorn ' nationally there were improvements in the numbers of pupils reaching the expected levels , in english -lrb- up by 2 % -rrb- , maths -lrb- up by 4 % -rrb- and science -lrb- up by 1 % -rrb- .
shadow education secretary tim yeo said : " these results show that the very schools labour has been undermining for 30 years continue to perform outstandingly well .
" crucially these schools do best at raising the performance of all levels of pupils regardless of their ability .

ministers have deliberately separated these test results from the gcse results - due out in a month 's time - to highlight them .
school standards minister david miliband said : " i believe that regular national testing helps support this improvement in schools . "
" it provides a national benchmark for standards and helps ensure that children in poorer areas do not get left behind . "
the tables , which do not include the independent schools that dominate the top of the gcse rankings , show grammar schools performing strongly .
among local authorities , rutland , north yorkshire , buckinghamshire and kingston-upon-thames were at the top .
at the other end of the table , the city of nottingham , southwark , tower hamlets and islington had the worst results .
' spurious rank ' but head teachers have been scathing about the introduction of more league tables .
john dunford , general secretary of the secondary heads association , said the school rankings were " flawed , misleading and unnecessary " .
" the league tables present a spurious rank order of schools , when the statistics on which they are based can not sustain such detailed comparisons , " said mr dunford .
he says it is well known that brighter pupils do well between the ages of 11 and 14 - so it is no surprise to see the grammar schools giving a good showing .
david hart , general secretary of the national association of head teachers , said : " performance tables for 14 year olds are an unnecessary irrelevance .
they serve no useful purpose when the tests themselves are of a totally different order to gcses or a-levels . "
' poisonous thorn ' nationally there were improvements in the numbers of pupils reaching the expected levels , in english -lrb- up by 2 % -rrb- , maths -lrb- up by 4 % -rrb- and science -lrb- up by 1 % -rrb- .
shadow education secretary tim yeo said : " these results show that the very schools labour has been undermining for 30 years continue to perform outstandingly well .
" crucially these schools do best at raising the performance of all levels of pupils regardless of their ability .
" we are determined that not a single grammar school will close .
liberal democrat education spokesman phil willis said : " league tables skew parent choice , fail to give informed choice and , most serious of all , condemn children with low performance to an educational underclass .
" while ministers continue to place their faith in school performance tables , this research concludes that they are little more than a poisonous thorn wedged in the side of educational progress . "

rigid metal lampposts can prove fatal if hit by a car , as the vehicle buckles around the structure and comes to an abrupt halt .
but hitting a flexible lamppost will cause it to bend underneath the car , causing less damage .
" the material buckles because the material itself has one tenth of the stiffness of steel , " jerry boyce of innovation firm europrojects , which developed the material , told bbc world service 's science in action programme .
" in other words , it will deflect 10 times more than steel under a load situation . "
saving lives the lampposts are made from a material created by weaving long , strong glass fibres into a polypropylene fabric .
the material has a strength matching that of metal , but is much more flexible . "
we 've had four crashes already on the roadside involving our lighting columns , and i 'm pleased to say no major injuries - including one crash , which was at 90 miles an hour " jerry boyce , europrojects the lampposts do not corrode , are environmentally-friendly , and are much safer .
" we tend to use steel as the product for our lighting columns , " mr boyce explained .
" the reason why we got involved in composite lighting columns was we wanted to offer a product that was maintenance-free .
" that means we do n't have to re-paint the product - it 's self-coloured - a product that would last probably 40 years as opposed to 20 or 25 years , and a product which , if a vehicle hits it under impact or a crash situation , would actually deflect , buckle or give way to the vehicle .
" hence we would save lives in an accident situation . "
the stiffness of the material can also be changed to allow the lamppost to buckle in certain directions .
the hatch at the base of the post - designed to allow electricians access to the power supply - has been utilised so that it creates a " natural flaw " around which the post collapses .
to minimise any risk to passers-by from lampposts collapsing , two different kinds of post have been developed .
one is for the countryside , where it is highly unlikely to be near pedestrians , where the column actually breaks away totally .
the column designed for the city is hinged and buckles , so it does not fall away and break .
" the actual vehicle will ride up along the length of the column , " mr boyce said .
" the likelihood would be that we will have at least slowed the vehicle down and not killed the occupants of the vehicle .
" at the same time , it does not allowed the vehicle itself to transgress into pedestrians . "
further uses the lampposts have already been put into use on some roads in britain , mr boyce added .
" we 've had four crashes already on the roadside involving our lighting columns , and i 'm pleased to say no major injuries - including one crash , which was at 90 miles an hour , " he stated .
" under normal circumstances if they 'd hit the steel pole it would almost certainly have resulted in death . "
the material has been put to many other uses too , including wind turbine blades , truck body panels and crash barriers .
a company in the south of england has also been using it to build high-speed rigid inflatable boats .
one further advantage is that the material is more environmentally-friendly than normal fibreglass , which uses liquid resins .
these resins contain a solvent which when processed is emitted into the atmosphere .
" at the end of its life - after 20 years of use - we can actually take the lighting columns , or any product made from this material , down , and re-extrude it , or re-injection mould it into another product , " mr boyce said .
" in other words , it 's recyclable . "

rigid metal lampposts can prove fatal if hit by a car , as the vehicle buckles around the structure and comes to an abrupt halt .
but hitting a flexible lamppost will cause it to bend underneath the car , causing less damage .
" the material buckles because the material itself has one tenth of the stiffness of steel , " jerry boyce of innovation firm europrojects , which developed the material , told bbc world service 's science in action programme .
" in other words , it will deflect 10 times more than steel under a load situation . "
saving lives the lampposts are made from a material created by weaving long , strong glass fibres into a polypropylene fabric .
the material has a strength matching that of metal , but is much more flexible .
we 've had four crashes already on the roadside involving our lighting columns , and i 'm pleased to say no major injuries - including one crash , which was at 90 miles an hour jerry boyce , europrojects the lampposts do not corrode , are environmentally-friendly , and are much safer .
" we tend to use steel as the product for our lighting columns , " mr boyce explained .
" the reason why we got involved in composite lighting columns was we wanted to offer a product that was maintenance-free .
" that means we do n't have to re-paint the product - it 's self-coloured - a product that would last probably 40 years as opposed to 20 or 25 years , and a product which , if a vehicle hits it under impact or a crash situation , would actually deflect , buckle or give way to the vehicle .
" hence we would save lives in an accident situation . "
the stiffness of the material can also be changed to allow the lamppost to buckle in certain directions .
the hatch at the base of the post - designed to allow electricians access to the power supply - has been utilised so that it creates a " natural flaw " around which the post collapses .
to minimise any risk to passers-by from lampposts collapsing , two different kinds of post have been developed .
one is for the countryside , where it is highly unlikely to be near pedestrians , where the column actually breaks away totally .
the column designed for the city is hinged and buckles , so it does not fall away and break .
" the actual vehicle will ride up along the length of the column , " mr boyce said .
" the likelihood would be that we will have at least slowed the vehicle down and not killed the occupants of the vehicle .
" at the same time , it does not allowed the vehicle itself to transgress into pedestrians . "
further uses the lampposts have already been put into use on some roads in britain , mr boyce added .
wind turbine blades are also made out of the material " we 've had four crashes already on the roadside involving our lighting columns , and i 'm pleased to say no major injuries - including one crash , which was at 90 miles an hour , " he stated .
" under normal circumstances if they 'd hit the steel pole it would almost certainly have resulted in death . "
the material has been put to many other uses too , including wind turbine blades , truck body panels and crash barriers .
a company in the south of england has also been using it to build high-speed rigid inflatable boats .
one further advantage is that the material is more environmentally-friendly than normal fibreglass , which uses liquid resins .

drivers will stage 24-hour walkouts on christmas eve and new year 's eve over the " unfair " sacking of a colleague .
the man , seen leaving a squash court while on sick leave , maintained he was exercising to aid his return to work .
a similar strike last month closed the circle line , which is normally used by 230,000 passengers a day .
and only a limited number of trains ran on the hammersmith & city line , which carries 162,000 people daily .
the rail , maritime and transport -lrb- rmt -rrb- union general secretary , bob crow , said london underground -lrb- lu -rrb- had failed to reverse the sacking and workers were fully behind the driver .
we are surprised the rmt are taking action as londoners try to enjoy their christmas and new year london underground but he said the union was prepared to hold talks at the conciliation service acas .
" we ca n't allow for injustices when our member was quite clearly told he needed sports therapy to repair his ankle , " he told bbc london at the time of the previous strike .
lu said it was " surprised " the rmt was taking more action , " especially as londoners try to enjoy their christmas and new year " .
in a statement , it said : " this employee has exhausted the appeals process and we believe his dismissal was both appropriate and fair . "
it promised to provide the best service possible on the strike days .
mayor ken livingstone has already been accused by the rmt of inflaming the row by supporting the sacking and claiming the driver had been off sick 20 % of the time since he started working on the underground in 1998 .
" i am only surprised he was allowed to get away with it for so long , " he said .
the rmt says drivers will not clock on for shifts starting between 0430 gmt on 24 december and 0429 gmt on 25 december , and between noon on 31 december and 1159 gmt on 1 january , 2004 .
this means tube services will be disrupted during the first part of new year 's day .

drivers will stage 24-hour walkouts on christmas eve and new year 's eve over the " unfair " sacking of a colleague .
the man , seen leaving a squash court while on sick leave , maintained he was exercising to aid his return to work .
a similar strike last month closed the circle line , which is normally used by 230,000 passengers a day .
and only a limited number of trains ran on the hammersmith & city line , which carries 162,000 people daily .
the rail , maritime and transport -lrb- rmt -rrb- union general secretary , bob crow , said london underground -lrb- lu -rrb- had failed to reverse the sacking and workers were fully behind the driver .
we are surprised the rmt are taking action as londoners try to enjoy their christmas and new year london underground but he said the union was prepared to hold talks at the conciliation service acas .
" we ca n't allow for injustices when our member was quite clearly told he needed sports therapy to repair his ankle , " he told bbc london at the time of the previous strike .
lu said it was " surprised " the rmt was taking more action , " especially as londoners try to enjoy their christmas and new year " .
in a statement , it said : " this employee has exhausted the appeals process and we believe his dismissal was both appropriate and fair . "
it promised to provide the best service possible on the strike days .
mayor ken livingstone has already been accused by the rmt of inflaming the row by supporting the sacking and claiming the driver had been off sick 20 % of the time since he started working on the underground in 1998 .
" i am only surprised he was allowed to get away with it for so long , " he said .
the rmt says drivers will not clock on for shifts starting between 0430 gmt on 24 december and 0429 gmt on 25 december , and between noon on 31 december and 1159 gmt on 1 january , 2004 .

but it will not be shown in asia after mtv asia said it would not immediately use the campaign - but would review it next year .
the mtv clip urges viewers to ask the united nations to help free the nobel peace prize winner from house arrest .
she was detained in may after violent clashes between her supporters and a government-backed mob .
her national league for democracy party won the 1990 elections by a landslide but the military junta refused to hand over power .
' freedom of expression ' mtv europe president brent hansen said : " mtv is all about providing a platform for the voice of young people , and we vehemently support everyone 's right to freedom of expression , no matter who they are or where they live . "
the campaign shows a teenage girl surrounded by posters , clothes in her bright bedroom - but the lights go out , the posters disappear and the carpet turns into a stone floor .
a photograph of suu kyi then appears alongside the words : " how would you feel if your home was a prison ? "
it then gives the address of a website to send a pre-written message to united nations secretary general kofi annan .
the burmese military government released five other leading opposition politicians from house arrest in november .
burma 's prime minister , general khin nyunt , recently announced a new seven stage " road map " to democracy , involving the drafting of a new constitution .

latest figures show half of all street crime now involves mobile phone theft .
nearly 200 are stolen in england and wales every day , mostly in london , and many are exported by gangs to africa , asia and europe .
the £ 1m national mobile phone crime unit will bring together immigration , customs and excise and police officers with industry experts .
senior police officers say , if successful , the unit could make a " significant " impact on the uk 's robbery problem .
reactivating a stolen phone over 70 % of the world 's mobile phones use gsm , the global system for mobile communications it means mobile phones can be used across national boundaries - known as ' roaming ' but it also means a phone stolen in the uk can be used anywhere where gsm operates including europe , asia and africa re-programming a stolen mobile phone to operate in the uk is relatively simple but to work abroad all it needs is a new sim card mobile phone networks have recently made advances in anti-crime measures , with all stolen phones now capable of being blocked for use in britain .
tough penalties are also in place for criminals who seek to re-programme handsets .
however , scotland yard 's commander john yates , who will be in charge of the unit , said it was believed the " epidemic " of mobile phone theft across britain was still being fuelled by an international market .
handsets taken abroad do not need re-programming and , while british customers are offered cheap phones as an incentive to sign up with networks , users abroad enjoy inexpensive calls but have to pay for handsets costing up to £ 800 each .
" this is all speculative at the moment , " said cmdr yates , " the aim of the unit is to find out what is generating mobile phone theft and what we can do to combat it " .
" if we crack it , it will make a significant impact on our robbery problem . "
to block a lost or stolen mobile 08701 123 123 he said there were some extremely organised gangs , particularly behind burglaries on retail outlets .
" the whole purpose is to understand where the volume is going , " cmdr yates added .
as part of the new initiative police are hoping to get industry co-operation to set up an international database to make all stolen handsets useless whatever their destination .
information gathered by the national mobile phone crime unit about how criminals operate will be passed to all law enforcement agencies and police forces across the uk .
although officially launched on wednesday , the unit has already been involved in 40 operations , making 22 arrests and recovering 1,200 stolen mobiles .
since 1999 the number of people using mobiles in britain has risen from 17 million to 51 million .
and soaring street crime , especially phone snatches , has led to criticism of the government 's record on law and order .
earlier this year prime minister tony blair promised to cut street crime in the worst affected areas .
