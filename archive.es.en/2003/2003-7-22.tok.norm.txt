with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms . the head of germany 's farming industry association has called the current heat wave ravaging europe the " drought of the century . " farmers all across the continent are turning to governments to help them deal with a climate crisis that is threatening or has destroyed valuable crops . gerd sonnleitner of the german farmer 's association met with german agriculture minister renate kunäst on monday night to discuss possibilities for emergency aid to the stricken industry .
at a press conference held after the meeting , sonnleitner said künast pledged to explore the options in her ministry and at the broader european union level . " the federal government wo n't be able to avoid such problems , if it takes on great dimensions , well beyond the states , " kunäst said on tuesday in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .
in germany , state governments and not the federal government are responsible for local agricultural policy and emergencies . worse than the floods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmer association president gerd sonnleitner the german farmers association estimated that losses in the worst-affected areas of the country - in the east and the south - amounted to up to 80 percent of the total harvest .
the grain harvest alone could suffer losses of up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- .
sonnleitner -lrb- photo -rrb- said the damage done by the drought is higher than the effects of the devastating floods that ravaged parts of southern germany last summer and cost billions of euros .
around 3.5 million hectares -lrb- 8.6 million acres -rrb- of crops have been affected . germany is not alone .
along with france , italy and austria , it plans to appeal for help at the european union agriculture and fisheries council in brussels , the tagesspiegel newspaper reported .
portugal and spain are expected to join the four in trying to convince the eu to issue direct subsidies to farmers - which are normally paid in winter - in advance , a member of the european council reportedly told the berlin paper . the countries ' representatives are also expected to ask the council to allow eu member states to distribute emergency agricultural funds to the hard-hit industry .
national governments may only lend a financial helping hand if production falls by more than 30 percent .
they may also attempt to have the drought declared a " natural disaster " to gain access to eu emergency funds .
the european farmers association copa-cocega called for eu assistance for afflicted farmers on friday . occupational hazards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the eu agriculture council , friedrich wilhelm graefe zu baringdorf , said the situation should not be exaggerated .
" there are some regions where too little rain has fallen , " he told inforadio berlin-brandenburg on tuesday .
that 's part of the " occupational hazards " of being a farmer .
" there are dry or wet years , " he added . meanwhile consumers can expect the drought to affect their wallets .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .
the bianchi rider is 67 seconds off the lead with just five stages left but the german remains confident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich hopes to be wearing a yellow shirt in this pose at the end of the tour .

the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" patients pay additional money , employers are relieved and doctors , hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry come away unscathed .
that ’ s not a reform , it ’ s pulling the wool over the public ’ s eyes .

under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .
the bianchi rider is 67 seconds off the lead with just five stages left but the german remains confident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich hopes to be wearing a yellow shirt in this pose at the end of the tour .
" it 's still a wide open race , " insisted ullrich , who will hope he can make some time back in saturday 's time trial .

the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.07.2003 baby airbus spreads its wings , finally großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up and away - the airbus a318 is finally on its way .
the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .
the crisis-riddled aviation industry needs the little plane to give it some much needed lift . after a four-year development phase marked by a series of blips , the first a318 was rolled out at the hamburg airbus plant finkenwerder on tuesday .
outfitted with 107 seats and a wide cabin in its normal version , the a318 then lifted off into the blue skies over hamburg for a successful four-hour test flight .
the 31,4 meter-long single aisle short fuselage a318 flies at a medium range between 2,750 and 6,000 kilometers and is a short-bodied version of the a319 .
airline executives are hoping it will prove to be the little airplane that could .
renewed hope for ailing hamburg plant the inaugural event provided a dollop of fresh hope for the hamburg airbus plant , which has not been immune to the industry crisis that has already engulfed its headquarters in toulouse , france .
" the successful debut flight of the a318 proves the technical competence and performing ability of hamburg as an airline location , " airbus ceo hans-joachim gante said after the flight .
" in times such as these we are doubly happy about any positive news , " rainer hertrich , ceo of the european aerospace consortium eads , the mother company of airbus , told the 700 employees in attendance .
in another hopeful sign for airbus , the hamburg senate decided to earmark € 56 million for the extension of the runway at the airbus plant from 589 to 3272 meters .
the extension is needed for the landing of the cargo version of the jumbo a380 , the largest passenger jet in history .
hit by a slump in air traffic due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of terrorist attacks , the airline industry is reeling .
the airbus plant in hamburg - the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse - has been suffering as orders for new planes have fallen .
only 11 aircraft instead of the planned 13 were assembled per month since january this year at the plant .
a318 runs into starting trouble however , despite tuesday 's successful launch , the road to that point has point anything but smooth . the plane was originally meant to be launched last year after a test flight in hamburg in january was lauded by industry and politicians .
but the a318 suffered a setback when u.s. jet engine-maker pratt & whitney discovered its new pw6000 engines weren ’ t up to quality standards and consumed too much fuel .
german aircraft engine-maker mtu then stepped in and with the help of a german technology program developed a special high pressure compressor which pratt & whitney used as a basis for a module that they integrated into their engines .
though the new technology finally worked , precious time was lost .
the airline industry crisis cut the original 134 orders for the a318 to 84 .
british airways and egyptair scrapped their orders for the aircraft , though nine other airlines and leasing companies have stuck to theirs .
airbus overtakes boeing denver-based frontier airlines is also staying loyal to the a318 .

the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .
the crisis-riddled aviation industry needs the little plane to give it some much needed lift . after a four-year development phase marked by a series of blips , the first a318 was rolled out at the hamburg airbus plant finkenwerder on tuesday .
outfitted with 107 seats and a wide cabin in its normal version , the a318 then lifted off into the blue skies over hamburg for a successful four-hour test flight .
the 31,4 meter-long single aisle short fuselage a318 flies at a medium range between 2,750 and 6,000 kilometers and is a short-bodied version of the a319 .
airline executives are hoping it will prove to be the little airplane that could .
renewed hope for ailing hamburg plant the inaugural event provided a dollop of fresh hope for the hamburg airbus plant , which has not been immune to the industry crisis that has already engulfed its headquarters in toulouse , france .
" the successful debut flight of the a318 proves the technical competence and performing ability of hamburg as an airline location , " airbus ceo hans-joachim gante said after the flight .
" in times such as these we are doubly happy about any positive news , " rainer hertrich , ceo of the european aerospace consortium eads , the mother company of airbus , told the 700 employees in attendance .
in another hopeful sign for airbus , the hamburg senate decided to earmark € 56 million for the extension of the runway at the airbus plant from 589 to 3272 meters .
the extension is needed for the landing of the cargo version of the jumbo a380 , the largest passenger jet in history .
hit by a slump in air traffic due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of terrorist attacks , the airline industry is reeling .
the airbus plant in hamburg - the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse - has been suffering as orders for new planes have fallen .
only 11 aircraft instead of the planned 13 were assembled per month since january this year at the plant .
a318 runs into starting trouble however , despite tuesday 's successful launch , the road to that point has point anything but smooth . the plane was originally meant to be launched last year after a test flight in hamburg in january was lauded by industry and politicians .
but the a318 suffered a setback when u.s. jet engine-maker pratt & whitney discovered its new pw6000 engines weren ’ t up to quality standards and consumed too much fuel .
german aircraft engine-maker mtu then stepped in and with the help of a german technology program developed a special high pressure compressor which pratt & whitney used as a basis for a module that they integrated into their engines .
though the new technology finally worked , precious time was lost .
the airline industry crisis cut the original 134 orders for the a318 to 84 .
british airways and egyptair scrapped their orders for the aircraft , though nine other airlines and leasing companies have stuck to theirs .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .
the bianchi rider is 67 seconds off the lead with just five stages left but the german remains confident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich hopes to be wearing a yellow shirt in this pose at the end of the tour .
" it 's still a wide open race , " insisted ullrich , who will hope he can make some time back in saturday 's time trial .

" in times such as these we are doubly happy about any positive news , " rainer hertrich , ceo of the european aerospace consortium eads , the mother company of airbus , told the 700 employees in attendance .
in another hopeful sign for airbus , the hamburg senate decided to earmark € 56 million for the extension of the runway at the airbus plant from 589 to 3272 meters .
the extension is needed for the landing of the cargo version of the jumbo a380 , the largest passenger jet in history .
hit by a slump in air traffic due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of terrorist attacks , the airline industry is reeling .
the airbus plant in hamburg - the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse - has been suffering as orders for new planes have fallen .
only 11 aircraft instead of the planned 13 were assembled per month since january this year at the plant .
a318 runs into starting trouble however , despite tuesday 's successful launch , the road to that point has point anything but smooth . the plane was originally meant to be launched last year after a test flight in hamburg in january was lauded by industry and politicians .
but the a318 suffered a setback when u.s. jet engine-maker pratt & whitney discovered its new pw6000 engines weren ’ t up to quality standards and consumed too much fuel .
german aircraft engine-maker mtu then stepped in and with the help of a german technology program developed a special high pressure compressor which pratt & whitney used as a basis for a module that they integrated into their engines .
though the new technology finally worked , precious time was lost .
the airline industry crisis cut the original 134 orders for the a318 to 84 .
british airways and egyptair scrapped their orders for the aircraft , though nine other airlines and leasing companies have stuck to theirs .
airbus overtakes boeing denver-based frontier airlines is also staying loyal to the a318 .
" we now have more airbus than boeing aircraft in our fleet , " frontier ceo jeff pottner said in hamburg while taking charge of his first a318 purchase after her maiden flight .
frontier already has 19 models of the a319s in its service .
" the wide-ranging similarities between these two aircraft save us much time and money when it comes to training of our flight personnel , " he said .
frontier is reported to have ordered a further five a318s with a 114-seat capacity , each costing $ 50 million .
airbus ' fortunes are also beginning to lift as the european consortium has for the first time in its history overtaken u.s. competitor boeing by delivering more aircraft in a six-month period than its u.s. rival boeing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg readies for arrival of super jumbo with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.07.2003 german health care shake-up draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics charge that schröder 's health plan cuts are toothless .
the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" patients pay additional money , employers are relieved and doctors , hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry come away unscathed .
that ’ s not a reform , it ’ s pulling the wool over the public ’ s eyes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.07.2003 german health care shake-up draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics charge that schröder 's health plan cuts are toothless .
the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" patients pay additional money , employers are relieved and doctors , hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry come away unscathed .
that ’ s not a reform , it ’ s pulling the wool over the public ’ s eyes .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .
the bianchi rider is 67 seconds off the lead with just five stages left but the german remains confident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich hopes to be wearing a yellow shirt in this pose at the end of the tour .
" it 's still a wide open race , " insisted ullrich , who will hope he can make some time back in saturday 's time trial .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .

the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .
the crisis-riddled aviation industry needs the little plane to give it some much needed lift . after a four-year development phase marked by a series of blips , the first a318 was rolled out at the hamburg airbus plant finkenwerder on tuesday .
outfitted with 107 seats and a wide cabin in its normal version , the a318 then lifted off into the blue skies over hamburg for a successful four-hour test flight .
the 31,4 meter-long single aisle short fuselage a318 flies at a medium range between 2,750 and 6,000 kilometers and is a short-bodied version of the a319 .
airline executives are hoping it will prove to be the little airplane that could .
renewed hope for ailing hamburg plant the inaugural event provided a dollop of fresh hope for the hamburg airbus plant , which has not been immune to the industry crisis that has already engulfed its headquarters in toulouse , france .
" the successful debut flight of the a318 proves the technical competence and performing ability of hamburg as an airline location , " airbus ceo hans-joachim gante said after the flight .
" in times such as these we are doubly happy about any positive news , " rainer hertrich , ceo of the european aerospace consortium eads , the mother company of airbus , told the 700 employees in attendance .
in another hopeful sign for airbus , the hamburg senate decided to earmark € 56 million for the extension of the runway at the airbus plant from 589 to 3272 meters .
the extension is needed for the landing of the cargo version of the jumbo a380 , the largest passenger jet in history .

the airbus plant in hamburg - the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse - has been suffering as orders for new planes have fallen .
only 11 aircraft instead of the planned 13 were assembled per month since january this year at the plant .
a318 runs into starting trouble however , despite tuesday 's successful launch , the road to that point has point anything but smooth . the plane was originally meant to be launched last year after a test flight in hamburg in january was lauded by industry and politicians .
but the a318 suffered a setback when u.s. jet engine-maker pratt & whitney discovered its new pw6000 engines weren ’ t up to quality standards and consumed too much fuel .
german aircraft engine-maker mtu then stepped in and with the help of a german technology program developed a special high pressure compressor which pratt & whitney used as a basis for a module that they integrated into their engines .
though the new technology finally worked , precious time was lost .
the airline industry crisis cut the original 134 orders for the a318 to 84 .
british airways and egyptair scrapped their orders for the aircraft , though nine other airlines and leasing companies have stuck to theirs .
airbus overtakes boeing denver-based frontier airlines is also staying loyal to the a318 .
" we now have more airbus than boeing aircraft in our fleet , " frontier ceo jeff pottner said in hamburg while taking charge of his first a318 purchase after her maiden flight .
frontier already has 19 models of the a319s in its service .
" the wide-ranging similarities between these two aircraft save us much time and money when it comes to training of our flight personnel , " he said .
frontier is reported to have ordered a further five a318s with a 114-seat capacity , each costing $ 50 million .

the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .

the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .
the bianchi rider is 67 seconds off the lead with just five stages left but the german remains confident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich hopes to be wearing a yellow shirt in this pose at the end of the tour .
" it 's still a wide open race , " insisted ullrich , who will hope he can make some time back in saturday 's time trial .
his optimism is far from misplaced .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .
the bianchi rider is 67 seconds off the lead with just five stages left but the german remains confident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich hopes to be wearing a yellow shirt in this pose at the end of the tour .
" it 's still a wide open race , " insisted ullrich , who will hope he can make some time back in saturday 's time trial .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.07.2003 german health care shake-up draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics charge that schröder 's health plan cuts are toothless .
the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" patients pay additional money , employers are relieved and doctors , hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry come away unscathed .
that ’ s not a reform , it ’ s pulling the wool over the public ’ s eyes .

the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.07.2003 german health care shake-up draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics charge that schröder 's health plan cuts are toothless .
the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" patients pay additional money , employers are relieved and doctors , hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry come away unscathed .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .
the bianchi rider is 67 seconds off the lead with just five stages left but the german remains confident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich hopes to be wearing a yellow shirt in this pose at the end of the tour .
" it 's still a wide open race , " insisted ullrich , who will hope he can make some time back in saturday 's time trial .
his optimism is far from misplaced .

the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .
the crisis-riddled aviation industry needs the little plane to give it some much needed lift . after a four-year development phase marked by a series of blips , the first a318 was rolled out at the hamburg airbus plant finkenwerder on tuesday .
outfitted with 107 seats and a wide cabin in its normal version , the a318 then lifted off into the blue skies over hamburg for a successful four-hour test flight .
the 31,4 meter-long single aisle short fuselage a318 flies at a medium range between 2,750 and 6,000 kilometers and is a short-bodied version of the a319 .
airline executives are hoping it will prove to be the little airplane that could .
renewed hope for ailing hamburg plant the inaugural event provided a dollop of fresh hope for the hamburg airbus plant , which has not been immune to the industry crisis that has already engulfed its headquarters in toulouse , france .
" the successful debut flight of the a318 proves the technical competence and performing ability of hamburg as an airline location , " airbus ceo hans-joachim gante said after the flight .
" in times such as these we are doubly happy about any positive news , " rainer hertrich , ceo of the european aerospace consortium eads , the mother company of airbus , told the 700 employees in attendance .
in another hopeful sign for airbus , the hamburg senate decided to earmark € 56 million for the extension of the runway at the airbus plant from 589 to 3272 meters .
the extension is needed for the landing of the cargo version of the jumbo a380 , the largest passenger jet in history .
hit by a slump in air traffic due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of terrorist attacks , the airline industry is reeling .
the airbus plant in hamburg - the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse - has been suffering as orders for new planes have fallen .
only 11 aircraft instead of the planned 13 were assembled per month since january this year at the plant .
a318 runs into starting trouble however , despite tuesday 's successful launch , the road to that point has point anything but smooth . the plane was originally meant to be launched last year after a test flight in hamburg in january was lauded by industry and politicians .
but the a318 suffered a setback when u.s. jet engine-maker pratt & whitney discovered its new pw6000 engines weren ’ t up to quality standards and consumed too much fuel .
german aircraft engine-maker mtu then stepped in and with the help of a german technology program developed a special high pressure compressor which pratt & whitney used as a basis for a module that they integrated into their engines .
though the new technology finally worked , precious time was lost .
the airline industry crisis cut the original 134 orders for the a318 to 84 .
british airways and egyptair scrapped their orders for the aircraft , though nine other airlines and leasing companies have stuck to theirs .
airbus overtakes boeing denver-based frontier airlines is also staying loyal to the a318 .
" we now have more airbus than boeing aircraft in our fleet , " frontier ceo jeff pottner said in hamburg while taking charge of his first a318 purchase after her maiden flight .
frontier already has 19 models of the a319s in its service .
" the wide-ranging similarities between these two aircraft save us much time and money when it comes to training of our flight personnel , " he said .
frontier is reported to have ordered a further five a318s with a 114-seat capacity , each costing $ 50 million .

the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .
the crisis-riddled aviation industry needs the little plane to give it some much needed lift . after a four-year development phase marked by a series of blips , the first a318 was rolled out at the hamburg airbus plant finkenwerder on tuesday .
outfitted with 107 seats and a wide cabin in its normal version , the a318 then lifted off into the blue skies over hamburg for a successful four-hour test flight .
the 31,4 meter-long single aisle short fuselage a318 flies at a medium range between 2,750 and 6,000 kilometers and is a short-bodied version of the a319 .
airline executives are hoping it will prove to be the little airplane that could .
renewed hope for ailing hamburg plant the inaugural event provided a dollop of fresh hope for the hamburg airbus plant , which has not been immune to the industry crisis that has already engulfed its headquarters in toulouse , france .
" the successful debut flight of the a318 proves the technical competence and performing ability of hamburg as an airline location , " airbus ceo hans-joachim gante said after the flight .
" in times such as these we are doubly happy about any positive news , " rainer hertrich , ceo of the european aerospace consortium eads , the mother company of airbus , told the 700 employees in attendance .
in another hopeful sign for airbus , the hamburg senate decided to earmark € 56 million for the extension of the runway at the airbus plant from 589 to 3272 meters .
the extension is needed for the landing of the cargo version of the jumbo a380 , the largest passenger jet in history .
hit by a slump in air traffic due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of terrorist attacks , the airline industry is reeling .
the airbus plant in hamburg - the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse - has been suffering as orders for new planes have fallen .
only 11 aircraft instead of the planned 13 were assembled per month since january this year at the plant .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .
the bianchi rider is 67 seconds off the lead with just five stages left but the german remains confident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich hopes to be wearing a yellow shirt in this pose at the end of the tour .
" it 's still a wide open race , " insisted ullrich , who will hope he can make some time back in saturday 's time trial .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .
the bianchi rider is 67 seconds off the lead with just five stages left but the german remains confident . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich hopes to be wearing a yellow shirt in this pose at the end of the tour .
" it 's still a wide open race , " insisted ullrich , who will hope he can make some time back in saturday 's time trial .

the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .
the crisis-riddled aviation industry needs the little plane to give it some much needed lift . after a four-year development phase marked by a series of blips , the first a318 was rolled out at the hamburg airbus plant finkenwerder on tuesday .
outfitted with 107 seats and a wide cabin in its normal version , the a318 then lifted off into the blue skies over hamburg for a successful four-hour test flight .
the 31,4 meter-long single aisle short fuselage a318 flies at a medium range between 2,750 and 6,000 kilometers and is a short-bodied version of the a319 .
airline executives are hoping it will prove to be the little airplane that could .
renewed hope for ailing hamburg plant the inaugural event provided a dollop of fresh hope for the hamburg airbus plant , which has not been immune to the industry crisis that has already engulfed its headquarters in toulouse , france .
" the successful debut flight of the a318 proves the technical competence and performing ability of hamburg as an airline location , " airbus ceo hans-joachim gante said after the flight .
" in times such as these we are doubly happy about any positive news , " rainer hertrich , ceo of the european aerospace consortium eads , the mother company of airbus , told the 700 employees in attendance .
in another hopeful sign for airbus , the hamburg senate decided to earmark € 56 million for the extension of the runway at the airbus plant from 589 to 3272 meters .
the extension is needed for the landing of the cargo version of the jumbo a380 , the largest passenger jet in history .
hit by a slump in air traffic due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of terrorist attacks , the airline industry is reeling .
the airbus plant in hamburg - the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse - has been suffering as orders for new planes have fallen .
only 11 aircraft instead of the planned 13 were assembled per month since january this year at the plant .
a318 runs into starting trouble however , despite tuesday 's successful launch , the road to that point has point anything but smooth . the plane was originally meant to be launched last year after a test flight in hamburg in january was lauded by industry and politicians .
but the a318 suffered a setback when u.s. jet engine-maker pratt & whitney discovered its new pw6000 engines weren ’ t up to quality standards and consumed too much fuel .
german aircraft engine-maker mtu then stepped in and with the help of a german technology program developed a special high pressure compressor which pratt & whitney used as a basis for a module that they integrated into their engines .
though the new technology finally worked , precious time was lost .
the airline industry crisis cut the original 134 orders for the a318 to 84 .
british airways and egyptair scrapped their orders for the aircraft , though nine other airlines and leasing companies have stuck to theirs .
airbus overtakes boeing denver-based frontier airlines is also staying loyal to the a318 .
" we now have more airbus than boeing aircraft in our fleet , " frontier ceo jeff pottner said in hamburg while taking charge of his first a318 purchase after her maiden flight .
frontier already has 19 models of the a319s in its service .
" the wide-ranging similarities between these two aircraft save us much time and money when it comes to training of our flight personnel , " he said .
frontier is reported to have ordered a further five a318s with a 114-seat capacity , each costing $ 50 million .
airbus ' fortunes are also beginning to lift as the european consortium has for the first time in its history overtaken u.s. competitor boeing by delivering more aircraft in a six-month period than its u.s. rival boeing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg readies for arrival of super jumbo with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august .

the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" patients pay additional money , employers are relieved and doctors , hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry come away unscathed .

" the federal government wo n't be able to avoid such problems , if it takes on great dimensions , well beyond the states , " kunäst said on tuesday in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 22.07.2003 german health care shake-up draws fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some critics charge that schröder 's health plan cuts are toothless .
the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .

with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms . the head of germany 's farming industry association has called the current heat wave ravaging europe the " drought of the century . " farmers all across the continent are turning to governments to help them deal with a climate crisis that is threatening or has destroyed valuable crops . gerd sonnleitner of the german farmer 's association met with german agriculture minister renate kunäst on monday night to discuss possibilities for emergency aid to the stricken industry .
at a press conference held after the meeting , sonnleitner said künast pledged to explore the options in her ministry and at the broader european union level . " the federal government wo n't be able to avoid such problems , if it takes on great dimensions , well beyond the states , " kunäst said on tuesday in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .
in germany , state governments and not the federal government are responsible for local agricultural policy and emergencies . worse than the floods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmer association president gerd sonnleitner the german farmers association estimated that losses in the worst-affected areas of the country - in the east and the south - amounted to up to 80 percent of the total harvest .
the grain harvest alone could suffer losses of up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- .
sonnleitner -lrb- photo -rrb- said the damage done by the drought is higher than the effects of the devastating floods that ravaged parts of southern germany last summer and cost billions of euros .
around 3.5 million hectares -lrb- 8.6 million acres -rrb- of crops have been affected . germany is not alone .
along with france , italy and austria , it plans to appeal for help at the european union agriculture and fisheries council in brussels , the tagesspiegel newspaper reported .
portugal and spain are expected to join the four in trying to convince the eu to issue direct subsidies to farmers - which are normally paid in winter - in advance , a member of the european council reportedly told the berlin paper . the countries ' representatives are also expected to ask the council to allow eu member states to distribute emergency agricultural funds to the hard-hit industry .
national governments may only lend a financial helping hand if production falls by more than 30 percent .
they may also attempt to have the drought declared a " natural disaster " to gain access to eu emergency funds .
the european farmers association copa-cocega called for eu assistance for afflicted farmers on friday . occupational hazards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the eu agriculture council , friedrich wilhelm graefe zu baringdorf , said the situation should not be exaggerated .
" there are some regions where too little rain has fallen , " he told inforadio berlin-brandenburg on tuesday .
that 's part of the " occupational hazards " of being a farmer .
" there are dry or wet years , " he added . meanwhile consumers can expect the drought to affect their wallets .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .

at a press conference held after the meeting , sonnleitner said künast pledged to explore the options in her ministry and at the broader european union level . " the federal government wo n't be able to avoid such problems , if it takes on great dimensions , well beyond the states , " kunäst said on tuesday in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 22.07.2003 baby airbus spreads its wings , finally großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up and away - the airbus a318 is finally on its way .
the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .
the crisis-riddled aviation industry needs the little plane to give it some much needed lift . after a four-year development phase marked by a series of blips , the first a318 was rolled out at the hamburg airbus plant finkenwerder on tuesday .
outfitted with 107 seats and a wide cabin in its normal version , the a318 then lifted off into the blue skies over hamburg for a successful four-hour test flight .
the 31,4 meter-long single aisle short fuselage a318 flies at a medium range between 2,750 and 6,000 kilometers and is a short-bodied version of the a319 .
airline executives are hoping it will prove to be the little airplane that could .
renewed hope for ailing hamburg plant the inaugural event provided a dollop of fresh hope for the hamburg airbus plant , which has not been immune to the industry crisis that has already engulfed its headquarters in toulouse , france .
" the successful debut flight of the a318 proves the technical competence and performing ability of hamburg as an airline location , " airbus ceo hans-joachim gante said after the flight .
" in times such as these we are doubly happy about any positive news , " rainer hertrich , ceo of the european aerospace consortium eads , the mother company of airbus , told the 700 employees in attendance .
in another hopeful sign for airbus , the hamburg senate decided to earmark € 56 million for the extension of the runway at the airbus plant from 589 to 3272 meters .
the extension is needed for the landing of the cargo version of the jumbo a380 , the largest passenger jet in history .
hit by a slump in air traffic due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of terrorist attacks , the airline industry is reeling .
the airbus plant in hamburg - the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse - has been suffering as orders for new planes have fallen .
only 11 aircraft instead of the planned 13 were assembled per month since january this year at the plant .
a318 runs into starting trouble however , despite tuesday 's successful launch , the road to that point has point anything but smooth . the plane was originally meant to be launched last year after a test flight in hamburg in january was lauded by industry and politicians .
but the a318 suffered a setback when u.s. jet engine-maker pratt & whitney discovered its new pw6000 engines weren ’ t up to quality standards and consumed too much fuel .
german aircraft engine-maker mtu then stepped in and with the help of a german technology program developed a special high pressure compressor which pratt & whitney used as a basis for a module that they integrated into their engines .
though the new technology finally worked , precious time was lost .
the airline industry crisis cut the original 134 orders for the a318 to 84 .
british airways and egyptair scrapped their orders for the aircraft , though nine other airlines and leasing companies have stuck to theirs .
airbus overtakes boeing denver-based frontier airlines is also staying loyal to the a318 .
" we now have more airbus than boeing aircraft in our fleet , " frontier ceo jeff pottner said in hamburg while taking charge of his first a318 purchase after her maiden flight .
frontier already has 19 models of the a319s in its service .
" the wide-ranging similarities between these two aircraft save us much time and money when it comes to training of our flight personnel , " he said .
frontier is reported to have ordered a further five a318s with a 114-seat capacity , each costing $ 50 million .
airbus ' fortunes are also beginning to lift as the european consortium has for the first time in its history overtaken u.s. competitor boeing by delivering more aircraft in a six-month period than its u.s. rival boeing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg readies for arrival of super jumbo with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august .

the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .

hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" patients pay additional money , employers are relieved and doctors , hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry come away unscathed .
that ’ s not a reform , it ’ s pulling the wool over the public ’ s eyes .

the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .

" in times such as these we are doubly happy about any positive news , " rainer hertrich , ceo of the european aerospace consortium eads , the mother company of airbus , told the 700 employees in attendance .
in another hopeful sign for airbus , the hamburg senate decided to earmark € 56 million for the extension of the runway at the airbus plant from 589 to 3272 meters .
the extension is needed for the landing of the cargo version of the jumbo a380 , the largest passenger jet in history .
hit by a slump in air traffic due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of terrorist attacks , the airline industry is reeling .
the airbus plant in hamburg - the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse - has been suffering as orders for new planes have fallen .
only 11 aircraft instead of the planned 13 were assembled per month since january this year at the plant .
a318 runs into starting trouble however , despite tuesday 's successful launch , the road to that point has point anything but smooth . the plane was originally meant to be launched last year after a test flight in hamburg in january was lauded by industry and politicians .
but the a318 suffered a setback when u.s. jet engine-maker pratt & whitney discovered its new pw6000 engines weren ’ t up to quality standards and consumed too much fuel .
german aircraft engine-maker mtu then stepped in and with the help of a german technology program developed a special high pressure compressor which pratt & whitney used as a basis for a module that they integrated into their engines .
though the new technology finally worked , precious time was lost .
the airline industry crisis cut the original 134 orders for the a318 to 84 .
british airways and egyptair scrapped their orders for the aircraft , though nine other airlines and leasing companies have stuck to theirs .
airbus overtakes boeing denver-based frontier airlines is also staying loyal to the a318 .
" we now have more airbus than boeing aircraft in our fleet , " frontier ceo jeff pottner said in hamburg while taking charge of his first a318 purchase after her maiden flight .
frontier already has 19 models of the a319s in its service .
" the wide-ranging similarities between these two aircraft save us much time and money when it comes to training of our flight personnel , " he said .
frontier is reported to have ordered a further five a318s with a 114-seat capacity , each costing $ 50 million .
airbus ' fortunes are also beginning to lift as the european consortium has for the first time in its history overtaken u.s. competitor boeing by delivering more aircraft in a six-month period than its u.s. rival boeing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg readies for arrival of super jumbo with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .

the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .

with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms . the head of germany 's farming industry association has called the current heat wave ravaging europe the " drought of the century . " farmers all across the continent are turning to governments to help them deal with a climate crisis that is threatening or has destroyed valuable crops . gerd sonnleitner of the german farmer 's association met with german agriculture minister renate kunäst on monday night to discuss possibilities for emergency aid to the stricken industry .
at a press conference held after the meeting , sonnleitner said künast pledged to explore the options in her ministry and at the broader european union level . " the federal government wo n't be able to avoid such problems , if it takes on great dimensions , well beyond the states , " kunäst said on tuesday in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .
in germany , state governments and not the federal government are responsible for local agricultural policy and emergencies . worse than the floods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmer association president gerd sonnleitner the german farmers association estimated that losses in the worst-affected areas of the country - in the east and the south - amounted to up to 80 percent of the total harvest .
the grain harvest alone could suffer losses of up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- .
sonnleitner -lrb- photo -rrb- said the damage done by the drought is higher than the effects of the devastating floods that ravaged parts of southern germany last summer and cost billions of euros .
around 3.5 million hectares -lrb- 8.6 million acres -rrb- of crops have been affected . germany is not alone .
along with france , italy and austria , it plans to appeal for help at the european union agriculture and fisheries council in brussels , the tagesspiegel newspaper reported .
portugal and spain are expected to join the four in trying to convince the eu to issue direct subsidies to farmers - which are normally paid in winter - in advance , a member of the european council reportedly told the berlin paper . the countries ' representatives are also expected to ask the council to allow eu member states to distribute emergency agricultural funds to the hard-hit industry .
national governments may only lend a financial helping hand if production falls by more than 30 percent .
they may also attempt to have the drought declared a " natural disaster " to gain access to eu emergency funds .
the european farmers association copa-cocega called for eu assistance for afflicted farmers on friday . occupational hazards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the eu agriculture council , friedrich wilhelm graefe zu baringdorf , said the situation should not be exaggerated .
" there are some regions where too little rain has fallen , " he told inforadio berlin-brandenburg on tuesday .
that 's part of the " occupational hazards " of being a farmer .
" there are dry or wet years , " he added . meanwhile consumers can expect the drought to affect their wallets .

the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" patients pay additional money , employers are relieved and doctors , hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry come away unscathed .

the german government reached a landmark compromise with the opposition on a radical revamp of the costly public healthcare system in a move fiercely criticized by social groups , employers and drug makers . german chancellor gerhard schröder on monday got a much-needed shot in the arm for his ambitious reform agenda when his coalition government of social democrats and greens struck a compromise with the conservative opposition after marathon negotiations on cutting back costs and streamlining one of the world ’ s most expensive health care systems .
the new reform agreement , which will force patients to pay more for treatment and reduce public heath insurance coverage for several services such as dentures and health spa visits , aims to slash costs by € 9.9 billion -lrb- $ 11.23 billion -rrb- next year , € 5.8 billion of which will come through increases in health insurance premiums for employees and co-payments for doctors ' visits . overall savings are expected to further rise to € 23 billion by 2007 .
the deal marks the largest overhaul to germany 's public healthcare system since unification in 1990 .
germans pay more for healthcare than any other nation apart from the united states and switzerland .
last year a cash shortfall of € 3 billion in public health funds prompted schröder ’ s government to find ways to save germany ’ s cash strapped social system from buckling .
" a balanced compromise " both the government and the opposition have hailed the deal as a " balanced compromise . "
olaf scholz , general secretary of schröder ’ s social democratic party , said the deal would lead to a " new positive mood " about the chancellor ’ s agenda 2010 reform package , a slew of structural , social and economic reforms aimed at shaking-up the country ’ s generous social system and making it accessible to future generations while at the same time resuscitating the sputtering economy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt german health minister .
speaking after the latest compromise reached with the opposition , german health minister ulla schmidt -lrb- photo -rrb- stressed on tuesday that " crusty old structures " would be broken by the new agreement .
horst seehofer , the opposition christian democratic union spokesman on healthcare issues said the cost burden would now be distributed equally between insurance premium payers , the pharmaceutical industry , doctors , public health funds and income tax payers .
" all are in the same boat , " he said .
schmidt added some of the changes were " revolutionary " and would increase health sector efficiency as well as lower labor costs for employers at a time when unemployment is over 10 percent and the economy is barely expected to grow for the next year .
employers : deal does n't go far enough despite general political endorsement of the latest reform plan - expected to be tabled in the parliament in september and implemented in january - a number of critics have emerged . employers ’ associations have long complained about soaring non-wage labor costs , of which health fund contributions represent a considerable chunk .
the new deal foresees health fund contributions - split equally between employers and employees - falling to 13 percent of gross wages by 2006 , from 14.4 percent today .
another key aspect of the deal eliminates so-called " sick pay . "
currently , after one week of illness , germany ’ s public health funds cover an employee ’ s wages for up to six weeks .
under the new agreement starting 2007 employees will be required to take out independent policies to cover illness-related wage losses .
despite the deal 's provision to ease pressure on employers , many groups are still unhappy with the plan .
dieter hundt , president of the confederation of german employers ’ associations said the reform compromise didn ’ t go far enough and added it was a matter of too little too late .
hundt said the slashing of health fund contributions to 13 percent of gross pay in 2006 would come too late to significantly contribute to an improved labor market .
similarly , he called for a " sick pay " exemption on the part of employers to take effect immediately and not in 2007 as planned .
hundt also called for employees to personally shoulder costs of dental care and private accidents and reduce the employer contribution to public health care funds .
drug makers unhappy with plan the pharmaceutical industry and markets also reacted negatively to the plan , with drug shares of bayer and schering ag slipping after the news .
the move is expected to cost pharmaceutical companies about € 1 billion next year .
" it will lead to a noticeable effect on revenues , " peter duellmann , analyst at sal .
oppenheim told reuters on tuesday .
" drug firms will realize innovation is not being encouraged in this country .
germany as a location for drug research will become less attractive in international comparison , " he said .
" a pure rip-off " for patients social organizations have also slammed the latest agreement , saying that it places the lion 's share of the cost burden on ordinary patients and wage earners who in the future will have to dig deeper into their pockets to pay for services and treatment .
the plans lay down that apart from work-related sickness benefits , other services such as fitting dentures , coverage of over-the-counter prescriptions and expensive fertility-related treatments like artificial insemination and sterilization procedures would also be dropped from the realm of public health funds .
instead , employees would have to take out additional policies for that either with private insurance companies or get it covered independently by public health funds .
patients will also have to pay up to € 10 per quarter to visit the doctor as well as for every day spent in a hospital for a maximum of 28 days a year .
walter hirrlinger , president of the vdk social organization , said the healthcare reforms would place a clear burden on insurance payers and their families .
" it ’ s a pure rip-off , " he told the daily berliner zeitung .
" patients pay additional money , employers are relieved and doctors , hospitals and the pharmaceutical industry come away unscathed .
that ’ s not a reform , it ’ s pulling the wool over the public ’ s eyes .

the “ baby ” airbus a318 , the newest addition to the jet manufacturer ’ s family , debuted in the skies over hamburg tuesday .
the crisis-riddled aviation industry needs the little plane to give it some much needed lift . after a four-year development phase marked by a series of blips , the first a318 was rolled out at the hamburg airbus plant finkenwerder on tuesday .
outfitted with 107 seats and a wide cabin in its normal version , the a318 then lifted off into the blue skies over hamburg for a successful four-hour test flight .
the 31,4 meter-long single aisle short fuselage a318 flies at a medium range between 2,750 and 6,000 kilometers and is a short-bodied version of the a319 .
airline executives are hoping it will prove to be the little airplane that could .
renewed hope for ailing hamburg plant the inaugural event provided a dollop of fresh hope for the hamburg airbus plant , which has not been immune to the industry crisis that has already engulfed its headquarters in toulouse , france .
" the successful debut flight of the a318 proves the technical competence and performing ability of hamburg as an airline location , " airbus ceo hans-joachim gante said after the flight .
" in times such as these we are doubly happy about any positive news , " rainer hertrich , ceo of the european aerospace consortium eads , the mother company of airbus , told the 700 employees in attendance .
in another hopeful sign for airbus , the hamburg senate decided to earmark € 56 million for the extension of the runway at the airbus plant from 589 to 3272 meters .
the extension is needed for the landing of the cargo version of the jumbo a380 , the largest passenger jet in history .
hit by a slump in air traffic due to the sars crisis in asia and canada and fears of terrorist attacks , the airline industry is reeling .
the airbus plant in hamburg - the third largest airline assembly line in the world after seattle and toulouse - has been suffering as orders for new planes have fallen .
only 11 aircraft instead of the planned 13 were assembled per month since january this year at the plant .
a318 runs into starting trouble however , despite tuesday 's successful launch , the road to that point has point anything but smooth . the plane was originally meant to be launched last year after a test flight in hamburg in january was lauded by industry and politicians .
but the a318 suffered a setback when u.s. jet engine-maker pratt & whitney discovered its new pw6000 engines weren ’ t up to quality standards and consumed too much fuel .
german aircraft engine-maker mtu then stepped in and with the help of a german technology program developed a special high pressure compressor which pratt & whitney used as a basis for a module that they integrated into their engines .
though the new technology finally worked , precious time was lost .
the airline industry crisis cut the original 134 orders for the a318 to 84 .
british airways and egyptair scrapped their orders for the aircraft , though nine other airlines and leasing companies have stuck to theirs .
airbus overtakes boeing denver-based frontier airlines is also staying loyal to the a318 .
" we now have more airbus than boeing aircraft in our fleet , " frontier ceo jeff pottner said in hamburg while taking charge of his first a318 purchase after her maiden flight .
frontier already has 19 models of the a319s in its service .
" the wide-ranging similarities between these two aircraft save us much time and money when it comes to training of our flight personnel , " he said .
frontier is reported to have ordered a further five a318s with a 114-seat capacity , each costing $ 50 million .
airbus ' fortunes are also beginning to lift as the european consortium has for the first time in its history overtaken u.s. competitor boeing by delivering more aircraft in a six-month period than its u.s. rival boeing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de hamburg readies for arrival of super jumbo with the completion of a massive new hanger and construction of others underway , hamburg 's airbus plant is buzzing with anticipation of the a380 super jumbo , which it will begin building in august .

despite recent unimpressive time trials , the four-time tour de france winner stormed back on monday to snatch stage 15 amid crashes and drama . if the tour de france 2003 is destined to be won by someone other than lance armstrong , no one has told the four-time winner and race legend from texas .
until monday , the 31-year-old rider on the u.s. postal service team had put in some rather below par performances in this current tour .
his unimpressive time trails had prompted some commentators to predict his demise , despite leading the chasing pack by 15 seconds at the start of the 15th stage . but armstrong stormed back to show the doubters and the pretenders to his crown that he had lost none of his brilliance or self-confidence by winning the 159.5 kilometer stage by 40 seconds - despite falling when his bike 's brake lever got entangled in a spectator 's bag .
armstrong 's first stage win of the race has relaunched his bid for a fifth straight yellow jersey which had looked under serious threat from germany 's jan ullrich , the 1997 winner , and team telekom 's alexander vinokourov until monday ’ s win .
but it was a hard-fought victory full of incident and potential disaster for the american .
spectator 's bag causes crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ace in the pack .
armstrong crashed around the six kilometer mark before the summit finish in the pyrenees after his handlebars got caught up with a spectator 's bag .
spanish rider iban mayo , who was riding just behind him , was also caught up in the tumble while ullrich , in third , swerved to avoid the melee .
after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .
as armstrong swept to victory , the challenge of his closest rivals , ullrich and vinokourov , appeared to melt away . ullrich and armstrong to duel to the end with vinokourov , the tour ’ s surprise package this year , now two minutes 45 seconds off the lead , the tour appears to be a straight fight between armstrong and ullrich .

" it 's still a wide open race , " insisted ullrich , who will hope he can make some time back in saturday 's time trial .

after completing an incredible comeback to win the stage , armstrong was loath to blame the incident on the spectators .
" it was also my fault for riding too much on the right of the road .
but after that i had a big adrenaline rush and just said to myself , ' lance , if you want to win the tour de france then it 's time to attack ' . "
and attack he did .
after the american remounted , he soon made up good time and caught the group headed by ullrich , with help from former teammate tyler hamilton .
following the unwritten rule in cycling which says that fellow riders should not take advantage of crashes or toilet breaks , hamilton slowed down the favourites group to allow his fellow american to catch up following his crashing fall .
gear problem almost ends challenge but once with the leaders again , armstrong almost fell off his bike again when his right foot jolted , apparently because of a problem with his gears , and he fell onto the frame of his bike .
" there was something wrong with my gears , " added armstrong , laughing .
" i do n't know ...
i 've had a few problems today . "
however , the shock had a largely positive effect on him and the reigning tour champion went on the push the leaders once more .

with a europe-wide heatwave threatening crops and farms , germany 's agricultural minister says she will seek european union relief for troubled farms . the head of germany 's farming industry association has called the current heat wave ravaging europe the " drought of the century . " farmers all across the continent are turning to governments to help them deal with a climate crisis that is threatening or has destroyed valuable crops . gerd sonnleitner of the german farmer 's association met with german agriculture minister renate kunäst on monday night to discuss possibilities for emergency aid to the stricken industry .
at a press conference held after the meeting , sonnleitner said künast pledged to explore the options in her ministry and at the broader european union level . " the federal government wo n't be able to avoid such problems , if it takes on great dimensions , well beyond the states , " kunäst said on tuesday in an interview with public broadcaster zdf .
in germany , state governments and not the federal government are responsible for local agricultural policy and emergencies . worse than the floods bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german farmer association president gerd sonnleitner the german farmers association estimated that losses in the worst-affected areas of the country - in the east and the south - amounted to up to 80 percent of the total harvest .
the grain harvest alone could suffer losses of up to € 1 billion -lrb- $ 1.1 billion -rrb- .
sonnleitner -lrb- photo -rrb- said the damage done by the drought is higher than the effects of the devastating floods that ravaged parts of southern germany last summer and cost billions of euros .
around 3.5 million hectares -lrb- 8.6 million acres -rrb- of crops have been affected . germany is not alone .
along with france , italy and austria , it plans to appeal for help at the european union agriculture and fisheries council in brussels , the tagesspiegel newspaper reported .
portugal and spain are expected to join the four in trying to convince the eu to issue direct subsidies to farmers - which are normally paid in winter - in advance , a member of the european council reportedly told the berlin paper . the countries ' representatives are also expected to ask the council to allow eu member states to distribute emergency agricultural funds to the hard-hit industry .
national governments may only lend a financial helping hand if production falls by more than 30 percent .
they may also attempt to have the drought declared a " natural disaster " to gain access to eu emergency funds .
the european farmers association copa-cocega called for eu assistance for afflicted farmers on friday . occupational hazards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chairman of the eu agriculture council , friedrich wilhelm graefe zu baringdorf , said the situation should not be exaggerated .

that 's part of the " occupational hazards " of being a farmer .
" there are dry or wet years , " he added . meanwhile consumers can expect the drought to affect their wallets .

the research by shelter scotland said 85 % of local authorities did not think they had enough temporary housing to cope with demand .
some 60 % of councils said they would have to use b & bs to meet the requirements of the housing -lrb- scotland -rrb- act 2001 .
however , the scottish executive said the study was out of date and councils maintain the situation is being brought under control .
shelter 's research focused on how councils had prepared for the introduction of the act , which gave all single homeless people the right to temporary housing from the end of september last year .
' unsuitable housing ' the charity 's survey of scotland 's 32 local authorities was completed before the implementation of the act .
gavin corbett , of shelter scotland , said : " it is totally unacceptable that homeless people are being placed in unsuitable housing .
" although the scottish executive has provided some money for new temporary accommodation it has not been enough .
if b & bs were n't there as a safety net , these additional applicants would in fact be homeless cosla spokesman " ironically , these shortfalls will allow the most expensive form of temporary accommodation - b & bs - to flourish .
this is economic madness . "
the convention of scottish local authorities -lrb- cosla -rrb- , which represents most councils , said an increasing use of temporary housing was inevitable .
a spokesman said : " in many respects shelter , as well as the rest of the housing lobby , must accept their share of responsibility for this .
" we can not ask for additional statutory rights , get them and then stand back and blame the executive when there 's an increased uptake of temporary accommodation .
" if b & bs were n't there as a safety net , these additional applicants would in fact be homeless - so in some ways this is a perverse success . "
new funding cosla said the rise in the use of b & bs was " disappointing " but said the situation was being brought under control .
the scottish executive said the research did not take account of new funding .
a spokeswoman said : " the study pre-dates the £ 127m over three years we committed in september 2002 to tackling homelessness . "
housing minister margaret curran said the executive had a fundamental strategy in place to combat homelessness .
" when you creates rights for people , they make use of those rights and that is why we have the increase in figures that we do .
" we have issued guidelines to reduce the number of families in bed and breakfast units and of course we want to eliminate it in the longer term . "
b & bs provide a safety net for those waiting on accomodation she added : " the way to solve homelessness is to get down to the fundamental causes which is not just about housing but other social problems . "
however mary scanlon , communities spokeswoman for the scottish conservative party , hit out at the minister 's claims that the executive was tackling scotland 's homelessness problem .
she also said that the number of households living in temporary accommodation had gone up by 147 % since the tories were last in power .
ms scanlon added : " the social justice annual report of 1999 stated that one of the primary aims of the scottish government was to reduce the number of households , particularly those with children , living in temporary accommodation .
" it is little wonder they rarely mention this abject failure , but the least i would expect from the minister is for her to admit that her strategy is failing miserably . "

they are normally found in bermuda , where mr parks has studied them .
many media reports last month also suggested that the creatures had arrived in british waters to breed .

now a new exhibition celebrating his career after the break-up of the fab four is to open at the beatles story .
the exhibition has been created by members of macca 's fame academy - students of the liverpool institute for performing arts -lrb- lipa -rrb- .
it is part of the solo years - an exhibition covering the time when the beatles did not all stand together after their 1970 split .
as well as reflecting on sir paul 's continuing musical success , the new exhibition focuses on his inspirational achievement in building the future through his support of lipa , which opened in 1996 .
morgan large , a final year lipa student of theatre and performance design , has created a floor map of sir paul 's life , which aims to make visitors feel they are flying over some of the important landmarks of his artistic development .
the buildings represented include sir paul 's family home at forthlin road , the skyline of liverpool , the mull of kintyre , london bridge and liverpool cathedral - where sir paul 's liverpool oratorio was first performed .
' dream come true ' they are set against the background of a large floor map , based on one of sir paul 's paintings .
mr large said : " to be a student at the institute which sir paul mccartney is linked to , and then to create a design for the beatles story , is a dream come true .
" i am thrilled that my design has been accepted for this exhibition . "
some of his best loved solo musical pieces , such as the liverpool oratorio and give my regards to broad street are featured , although it is not clear how much prominence is given to rupert and the frog song .
macca also appears in a regular video performance where he speaks of how much lipa - and indeed the building itself , which is where paul went to school - is important to him .
new generation jerry goldman , director of the beatles story , said : " i was recently made very aware , in addition to everything that sir paul has achieved in his career , of his influence on the new generation .
" it was during the lipa prize-giving ceremony that it was really brought home to me , and i felt that we should illustrate this element of his work for a wider audience - and now we have the result of this through collaboration with the students . "
lighting designers richard reardon and sarah kamender , who are also studying at lipa , were involved .
the video was compiled by ex-lipa student elisabeth nord of grief nord productions .
the exhibition opens to the public on saturday .

as well as reflecting on sir paul 's continuing musical success , the new exhibition focuses on his inspirational achievement in building the future through his support of lipa , which opened in 1996 .
morgan large , a final year lipa student of theatre and performance design , has created a floor map of sir paul 's life , which aims to make visitors feel they are flying over some of the important landmarks of his artistic development .
the buildings represented include sir paul 's family home at forthlin road , the skyline of liverpool , the mull of kintyre , london bridge and liverpool cathedral - where sir paul 's liverpool oratorio was first performed .
' dream come true ' they are set against the background of a large floor map , based on one of sir paul 's paintings .
mr large said : " to be a student at the institute which sir paul mccartney is linked to , and then to create a design for the beatles story , is a dream come true .
" i am thrilled that my design has been accepted for this exhibition . "
some of his best loved solo musical pieces , such as the liverpool oratorio and give my regards to broad street are featured , although it is not clear how much prominence is given to rupert and the frog song .
the beatles story is one of liverpool 's top attractions macca also appears in a regular video performance where he speaks of how much lipa - and indeed the building itself , which is where paul went to school - is important to him .
new generation jerry goldman , director of the beatles story , said : " i was recently made very aware , in addition to everything that sir paul has achieved in his career , of his influence on the new generation .

on tuesday workers will spend another day on the streets , providing information , advice and fact sheets from a mobile stand based on oxford street .
project deputy director gill burton said those who helped establish sand all those years ago could not have imagined the scale of the drug problem in swansea and across wales today .
we want to talk to parents , students , shopkeepers , housewives , professionals - in fact anyone who lives or works in swansea deputy director gill burton " i do not think that any of the people who first started the agency ever imagined that the project would become so successful , " she said .
" nor do i imagine that they anticipated that the number of people using drugs and those developing problems would ever reach the level that it has done so today . "

crack cocaine over 90 of these had problems with heroin - both smoking and injecting the drug .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- the small business panel of experts home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : tuesday , 22 july , 2003 , 07:22 gmt 08:22 uk e-mail this to a friend printable version the small business panel of experts a panel of experts on small business answer questions from bbc news online readers .
whether you are worried about growing your company without losing control , agonising over funding , or designing a killer marketing campaign , our panellists can help you .
following an overwhelming response , bbc news online is publishing a second series of answers to your questions .
we have tried to include as many questions as possible .
simon edwards of cobra beer , talks about targeted marketing and how to increase your sales david wilkinson , partner at ernst & young , on the best time to grow your small business liz barclay , presenter of radio 4 's you and yours , tells how to check out partner companies and win new contracts nigel nicholson , professor , london business school , comments on dealing with takeovers and bringing outsiders into a family business peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking , on ex-prisoners who ca n't open a bank account and working abroad bbc news online will publish the next set of answers from our panel of small business experts on tuesday , 29 july .
question dan cookson , uk myhouseprice.com provides consumers an online house price service .
we are steadily building our brand on a small budget .
we have used a mix of marketing including radio , tv , newspaper adverts , e-mail , with varying degrees of success .
do you have any advice on how to spread a small marketing / pr budget - do we focus on just those channels that give the best return or should we spread our budget thinly across them all ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer i 've had a look around your site and it 's a great idea - i 'm just getting my house re-mortgaged and i wish i could search my area to see what 's been selling and for how much .
roll on the roll-out to the rest of the uk !
quite simply , the smaller your budget the more careful you have to be with it - do not compromise , do all you can to ensure that every pound spent is a solid investment for your company - i.e. have a very good idea what you are expecting to get back in return .
for a small budget my advice would be to cut down on the mix of media .
the more you spread your budget the less weight you will have for each type of media .
you need to make sure that your target audience is seeing the ad a few times rather than thousands of different people seeing the ads only once .
the aim is to build an association between " house price " and " myhouseprice.com " .
you can help that association by placing ads where people are thinking about the value of their house e.g. garden centres , diy stores , as well as in the ' houses for sale ' section of the papers .
if you already have some tried-and-tested marketing channels , stick with the ones that are working well for you .
you did n't mention if you had tried direct marketing .
you could quite easily target a neighbourhood where a house has just sold , with a door drop .
for example , " last month x number of houses were sold in this postcode and you can find out the selling price on myhouseprice.com " .
have you tried a partnership with an estate agent ?
when someone is looking to buy a house they can spot a " for sale " or " sold " sign at 1000 yards - you could add another sign to the agent 's , telling people they can see how much it sells / sold for on myhouseprice.com.
question gareth llewellyn , england my partner and i run jabba-wocky clothing , an independent clothes shop in bournemouth , and we trade on the internet .
the shop is very well known in bournemouth and the internet sales are going very well , but how can we promote the brand nationally without spending a huge amount of money on advertising or opening shops in every large town ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer it 's a little tricky to answer not knowing what your idea of a huge amount of money is - you will have to invest something if you want to expand your business .
however , there are many ways to reach a nationwide audience cost-effectively if you focus on the audience most likely to buy your clothes .
for example small ads in the back of fashion / lifestyle / music magazines , the back of club flyers , handing out flyers when clubs close .
have you looked at getting your website at the top of searches for " clubbing clothing " or whichever words you think most appropriate ?
freshers week is coming up and it would be worth investigating what it would cost to get a flyer included in the giveaway packs handed out to new students .
there are numerous ways to target students including student-specific websites , on which you place links .
as the products you sell are n't unique to your shop , concentrate on the service side .
make sure that whatever you send out is 100 % correct and is received promptly - make it very , very easy for people to use your site and get the right order every time .
think of what you can send with the order that might prompt another order e.g. a ' 10 % off ' voucher valid for the next order , or an added value item like a postcard of the character on their clothing .
once you have their address , and if they have agreed to receive further mail , you could send them e-mails or brochures , when new stock comes in .
keep the lines of communication open , friendly , fun , and relevant , backed up with great service and you will have happy customers .
return to the top question rich , uk i am a director within a small computer graphics company of just two directors and no further staff .
the company was started straight after university five years ago and we have had reasonable success after the initial financial hurdles .
however , we sometimes both feel that if we were better business ' managers ' and had the minds of business men , we would be millionaires by now !
do you know of any instances where small firms have ' brought in ' a manager to run the business , whilst not handing over the company on a plate ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young one of the toughest challenges faced by growing companies is knowing when to bring in management that will help the business move into its next growth phase .
when you hire a manager on board , you will want to compensate them on the basis of their performance , and usually giving them a stake in the business is a good incentive .
there are many success stories of entrepreneurs who have had to make this difficult move , but who still remain wholly involved in the business , and who retain a majority stake .
however , with a business your size , it may be wiser to reach out in your own network and get some advice from someone with some business management expertise and perhaps bring them aboard as a non-executive .
it may be too early to bring a full-time manager on board .
there are a number of business plan proformas and guides that will help you structure your thoughts .
one such guide is ernst & young 's guide to producing a business plan , which can be found on our website : www.ey.com / uk / entrepreneur once you have a complete understanding of your business objectives , you can assess where you need particular assistance in moving your business forward .
return to the top question rupal rajani , england i have an idea / invention and am thinking of commissioning a company based in ireland to carry out a market research report for me .
how do i go about finding out if it is a reputable company or not ?
is there an organisation or body which i can contact ?
answer liz barclay , presenter of radio 4 's you and yours any reputable company you are thinking of employing in whatever field will expect you to check out its credentials .
ask for details of past clients you can talk to .
if it 's reputable there 's nothing to hide .
if you ask for that information and are refused , think twice .
check which market research body the firm belongs to and ask for the qualifications of the people you will be dealing with .
check them out .
your local chamber of commerce is often a good source of information about the activities of companies in its area but may know nothing about the company you want to use as it 's based in ireland .
question phil hayes , uk we are a small -lrb- £ 1.25m annual turnover -rrb- consultancy offering executive coaching and leadership training .
so far we have been successful -lrb- first five years -rrb- but this year we are finding it harder to win contracts .
should we niche our offer more or generalise it more ?
answer liz barclay , presenter of radio 4 's you and yours why are you finding it harder to win contracts ?
is it because of a general downturn in the market due to firms being more cautious in the current financial climate ?
are there other firms around your patch now offering something similar ?
have you somehow failed to keep up to date or ahead of the game - is it time to update your product ?
it 's time to take another look at the market you 're selling to - more market research .
talk to the companies you have successfully worked with in the past and find out whether they 're cutting back or looking for something new .
in a downturn , you may have to diversify a bit to bring in more customers , but you can go too far down that route and get too far away from your core activity , leaving the business vulnerable .
on the other hand if you do specialise more , you need to be sure that the market wants that specialism and that it 's giving you a unique selling point that your competitors do n't have .
return to the top question hk , england when a small business with flat management structure is taken over by a multinational firm with several tiers of management , what are the repercussions of it on the small firm , and in what way , if at all , can the working spirit of the current firm be retained ?
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school this is a difficult situation .
first of all , the good news is that in most acquisitions the chief beneficiary -lrb- financially -rrb- is the acquired firm , and the chief loser is the acquirer .
this , of course , says nothing about the effects on culture , or ' working spirit ' as you put it .
to keep the spirit of an acquired company intact the acquirer has only two choices .
one : leave it be and protect it , as the pearl in its oyster .
two : capture and spread the spirit by giving its movers prime statuses in the integrated business .
neither is guaranteed to succeed , for big corporations have their own inexorable logic which drains the spirit out of companies like yours , unless they themselves have exceptional spirit , as some -lrb- but not enough -rrb- do .
sorry if this response depresses you !
question patrick gray , wales company established in 1945 by t. b. davies , grandfather of the managing director , patrick gray , 60 .
son david , 31 , is a director .
employees : 34 .
turnover : £ 4m .
the problem is whether the business - which we do not wish to sell - can be promoted into the £ 10-15m league by existing staff or whether we should get in an md who will put a new energy into the business and allow me to retire without worry !
growth was 24 % in 2002 and 20 % in the first six months of 2003 .
we are becoming a very profitable company .
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school congratulations !
you 're riding the stallion of success , but when it 's fast like this there are big dangers .
all high-growth businesses are subject to exceptional stress .
employees get change fatigue , and the energy flags just when you need it .
leaders have a critical role in keeping the spirit moving and making the decisions that will keep the fast-growing firm on track .
in your case , you as md are not old but your son is young , and if you want to retire , outsiders might be helpful to help bridge the transition and keep the business moving .
the more benefit you can get from external perspectives , the better .
moreover , as companies increase in size they need more systematic management systems and processes .
of course , you should be loyal to your existing staff and make them core to whatever developments ensue , but professional management to support your son and them should be part of your plan .
make sure you reward outsiders and include them as ' extended family ' , which means that it is vital to select people you feel really comfortable with and who are prepared to engage constructively with you .
you should not think of ' cold turkey ' retirement - the risk is that you 'll suffer and not be able to resist interfering from your outside encampment .
much better that you and your son figure out a meaningful but hands-off role for you - such as new business development - that you can practice part-time .
return to the top question tad stone , uk i am involved in resettlement of prisoners at a d-category prison where i run business planning groups .
i am also a business adviser and run my own business .
we have terrible trouble opening business bank accounts for ex-prisoners , even though they do not want loans or overdrafts .
a current client who has been offered a prince 's trust loan is restarting a previously successful business after problems with the inland revenue .
his only crime was incompetence in bookkeeping .
we have arranged a bookkeeper , set up systems and he has a business mentor .
he has put together an excellent and very workable business plan , been thoroughly vetted by the prince 's trust , is putting in his own money , plus existing vehicles and tools valued at some £ 50k .
the only thing now preventing start-up is a bank account .
what do you suggest ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking at natwest we recognise that there are many reasons why customers may have had financial difficulties in the past and have adverse data registered against them .
we also recognise that this does not necessarily stop a new business venture from becoming successful .
we do offer business current accounts , without borrowing to all customers -lrb- apart from undischarged bankrupts and where there is evidence of deliberate fraud -rrb- irrespective of their credit standing .
our aim is to help businesses build up a track record after which we will consider borrowing requests .
question greenham murage , uk i am interested in starting a business which will mainly invest in africa and asia .
how do i finance the business ?
do banks like yours help small start-ups whose business does not target the uk market , but africa and other third-world countries ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking natwest looks to support commercially viable business propositions whether they are intending to trade just within the uk or further afield in europe and / or globally .
my advice is the same as it would be for any new business - planning and research are key .
additionally you will need to consider the possible language barriers , visa / work permit requirement , business legislation and any local customs .
you will also need to decide whether your business will trade in sterling , us dollars , euro or the local currency and how you will process payments between the uk and overseas .
i recommend that you discuss your proposition in full with your bank manager , accountant and legal adviser .
return to the top the opinions expressed above are those of the panel of experts , not the bbc 's .
the advice is not intended to be definitive and should be used for guidance only .
always seek professional advice for your own particular situation .

question dan cookson , uk myhouseprice.com provides consumers an online house price service .
we are steadily building our brand on a small budget .
we have used a mix of marketing including radio , tv , newspaper adverts , e-mail , with varying degrees of success .
do you have any advice on how to spread a small marketing / pr budget - do we focus on just those channels that give the best return or should we spread our budget thinly across them all ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer i 've had a look around your site and it 's a great idea - i 'm just getting my house re-mortgaged and i wish i could search my area to see what 's been selling and for how much .
roll on the roll-out to the rest of the uk !
quite simply , the smaller your budget the more careful you have to be with it - do not compromise , do all you can to ensure that every pound spent is a solid investment for your company - i.e. have a very good idea what you are expecting to get back in return .
for a small budget my advice would be to cut down on the mix of media .
the more you spread your budget the less weight you will have for each type of media .
you need to make sure that your target audience is seeing the ad a few times rather than thousands of different people seeing the ads only once .
the aim is to build an association between " house price " and " myhouseprice.com " .
you can help that association by placing ads where people are thinking about the value of their house e.g. garden centres , diy stores , as well as in the ' houses for sale ' section of the papers .
if you already have some tried-and-tested marketing channels , stick with the ones that are working well for you .
you did n't mention if you had tried direct marketing .
you could quite easily target a neighbourhood where a house has just sold , with a door drop .
for example , " last month x number of houses were sold in this postcode and you can find out the selling price on myhouseprice.com " .
have you tried a partnership with an estate agent ?
when someone is looking to buy a house they can spot a " for sale " or " sold " sign at 1000 yards - you could add another sign to the agent 's , telling people they can see how much it sells / sold for on myhouseprice.com.
question gareth llewellyn , england my partner and i run jabba-wocky clothing , an independent clothes shop in bournemouth , and we trade on the internet .
the shop is very well known in bournemouth and the internet sales are going very well , but how can we promote the brand nationally without spending a huge amount of money on advertising or opening shops in every large town ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer it 's a little tricky to answer not knowing what your idea of a huge amount of money is - you will have to invest something if you want to expand your business .
however , there are many ways to reach a nationwide audience cost-effectively if you focus on the audience most likely to buy your clothes .
for example small ads in the back of fashion / lifestyle / music magazines , the back of club flyers , handing out flyers when clubs close .
have you looked at getting your website at the top of searches for " clubbing clothing " or whichever words you think most appropriate ?
freshers week is coming up and it would be worth investigating what it would cost to get a flyer included in the giveaway packs handed out to new students .
there are numerous ways to target students including student-specific websites , on which you place links .
as the products you sell are n't unique to your shop , concentrate on the service side .
make sure that whatever you send out is 100 % correct and is received promptly - make it very , very easy for people to use your site and get the right order every time .
think of what you can send with the order that might prompt another order e.g. a ' 10 % off ' voucher valid for the next order , or an added value item like a postcard of the character on their clothing .
once you have their address , and if they have agreed to receive further mail , you could send them e-mails or brochures , when new stock comes in .
keep the lines of communication open , friendly , fun , and relevant , backed up with great service and you will have happy customers .
return to the top question rich , uk i am a director within a small computer graphics company of just two directors and no further staff .
the company was started straight after university five years ago and we have had reasonable success after the initial financial hurdles .
however , we sometimes both feel that if we were better business ' managers ' and had the minds of business men , we would be millionaires by now !
do you know of any instances where small firms have ' brought in ' a manager to run the business , whilst not handing over the company on a plate ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young one of the toughest challenges faced by growing companies is knowing when to bring in management that will help the business move into its next growth phase .
when you hire a manager on board , you will want to compensate them on the basis of their performance , and usually giving them a stake in the business is a good incentive .
there are many success stories of entrepreneurs who have had to make this difficult move , but who still remain wholly involved in the business , and who retain a majority stake .
however , with a business your size , it may be wiser to reach out in your own network and get some advice from someone with some business management expertise and perhaps bring them aboard as a non-executive .
it may be too early to bring a full-time manager on board .
there are a number of business plan proformas and guides that will help you structure your thoughts .
one such guide is ernst & young 's guide to producing a business plan , which can be found on our website : www.ey.com / uk / entrepreneur once you have a complete understanding of your business objectives , you can assess where you need particular assistance in moving your business forward .
return to the top question rupal rajani , england i have an idea / invention and am thinking of commissioning a company based in ireland to carry out a market research report for me .
how do i go about finding out if it is a reputable company or not ?
is there an organisation or body which i can contact ?
answer liz barclay , presenter of radio 4 's you and yours any reputable company you are thinking of employing in whatever field will expect you to check out its credentials .
ask for details of past clients you can talk to .
if it 's reputable there 's nothing to hide .
if you ask for that information and are refused , think twice .
check which market research body the firm belongs to and ask for the qualifications of the people you will be dealing with .
check them out .
your local chamber of commerce is often a good source of information about the activities of companies in its area but may know nothing about the company you want to use as it 's based in ireland .
question phil hayes , uk we are a small -lrb- £ 1.25m annual turnover -rrb- consultancy offering executive coaching and leadership training .
so far we have been successful -lrb- first five years -rrb- but this year we are finding it harder to win contracts .
should we niche our offer more or generalise it more ?
answer liz barclay , presenter of radio 4 's you and yours why are you finding it harder to win contracts ?
is it because of a general downturn in the market due to firms being more cautious in the current financial climate ?
are there other firms around your patch now offering something similar ?
have you somehow failed to keep up to date or ahead of the game - is it time to update your product ?
it 's time to take another look at the market you 're selling to - more market research .

question patrick gray , wales company established in 1945 by t. b. davies , grandfather of the managing director , patrick gray , 60 .
son david , 31 , is a director .
employees : 34 .
turnover : £ 4m .
the problem is whether the business - which we do not wish to sell - can be promoted into the £ 10-15m league by existing staff or whether we should get in an md who will put a new energy into the business and allow me to retire without worry !
growth was 24 % in 2002 and 20 % in the first six months of 2003 .
we are becoming a very profitable company .
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school congratulations !
you 're riding the stallion of success , but when it 's fast like this there are big dangers .
all high-growth businesses are subject to exceptional stress .
employees get change fatigue , and the energy flags just when you need it .
leaders have a critical role in keeping the spirit moving and making the decisions that will keep the fast-growing firm on track .
in your case , you as md are not old but your son is young , and if you want to retire , outsiders might be helpful to help bridge the transition and keep the business moving .
the more benefit you can get from external perspectives , the better .
moreover , as companies increase in size they need more systematic management systems and processes .
of course , you should be loyal to your existing staff and make them core to whatever developments ensue , but professional management to support your son and them should be part of your plan .
make sure you reward outsiders and include them as ' extended family ' , which means that it is vital to select people you feel really comfortable with and who are prepared to engage constructively with you .
you should not think of ' cold turkey ' retirement - the risk is that you 'll suffer and not be able to resist interfering from your outside encampment .
much better that you and your son figure out a meaningful but hands-off role for you - such as new business development - that you can practice part-time .
return to the top question tad stone , uk i am involved in resettlement of prisoners at a d-category prison where i run business planning groups .
i am also a business adviser and run my own business .
we have terrible trouble opening business bank accounts for ex-prisoners , even though they do not want loans or overdrafts .
a current client who has been offered a prince 's trust loan is restarting a previously successful business after problems with the inland revenue .
his only crime was incompetence in bookkeeping .
we have arranged a bookkeeper , set up systems and he has a business mentor .
he has put together an excellent and very workable business plan , been thoroughly vetted by the prince 's trust , is putting in his own money , plus existing vehicles and tools valued at some £ 50k .
the only thing now preventing start-up is a bank account .
what do you suggest ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking at natwest we recognise that there are many reasons why customers may have had financial difficulties in the past and have adverse data registered against them .
we also recognise that this does not necessarily stop a new business venture from becoming successful .
we do offer business current accounts , without borrowing to all customers -lrb- apart from undischarged bankrupts and where there is evidence of deliberate fraud -rrb- irrespective of their credit standing .
our aim is to help businesses build up a track record after which we will consider borrowing requests .
question greenham murage , uk i am interested in starting a business which will mainly invest in africa and asia .
how do i finance the business ?
do banks like yours help small start-ups whose business does not target the uk market , but africa and other third-world countries ?
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking natwest looks to support commercially viable business propositions whether they are intending to trade just within the uk or further afield in europe and / or globally .
my advice is the same as it would be for any new business - planning and research are key .
additionally you will need to consider the possible language barriers , visa / work permit requirement , business legislation and any local customs .
you will also need to decide whether your business will trade in sterling , us dollars , euro or the local currency and how you will process payments between the uk and overseas .
i recommend that you discuss your proposition in full with your bank manager , accountant and legal adviser .
return to the top the opinions expressed above are those of the panel of experts , not the bbc 's .
the advice is not intended to be definitive and should be used for guidance only .
always seek professional advice for your own particular situation .

question dan cookson , uk myhouseprice.com provides consumers an online house price service .
we are steadily building our brand on a small budget .
we have used a mix of marketing including radio , tv , newspaper adverts , e-mail , with varying degrees of success .
do you have any advice on how to spread a small marketing / pr budget - do we focus on just those channels that give the best return or should we spread our budget thinly across them all ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer i 've had a look around your site and it 's a great idea - i 'm just getting my house re-mortgaged and i wish i could search my area to see what 's been selling and for how much .
roll on the roll-out to the rest of the uk !
quite simply , the smaller your budget the more careful you have to be with it - do not compromise , do all you can to ensure that every pound spent is a solid investment for your company - i.e. have a very good idea what you are expecting to get back in return .
for a small budget my advice would be to cut down on the mix of media .
the more you spread your budget the less weight you will have for each type of media .
you need to make sure that your target audience is seeing the ad a few times rather than thousands of different people seeing the ads only once .
the aim is to build an association between " house price " and " myhouseprice.com " .
you can help that association by placing ads where people are thinking about the value of their house e.g. garden centres , diy stores , as well as in the ' houses for sale ' section of the papers .
if you already have some tried-and-tested marketing channels , stick with the ones that are working well for you .
you did n't mention if you had tried direct marketing .
you could quite easily target a neighbourhood where a house has just sold , with a door drop .
for example , " last month x number of houses were sold in this postcode and you can find out the selling price on myhouseprice.com " .
have you tried a partnership with an estate agent ?
when someone is looking to buy a house they can spot a " for sale " or " sold " sign at 1000 yards - you could add another sign to the agent 's , telling people they can see how much it sells / sold for on myhouseprice.com.
question gareth llewellyn , england my partner and i run jabba-wocky clothing , an independent clothes shop in bournemouth , and we trade on the internet .
the shop is very well known in bournemouth and the internet sales are going very well , but how can we promote the brand nationally without spending a huge amount of money on advertising or opening shops in every large town ?
answer simon edwards , marketing director at cobra beer it 's a little tricky to answer not knowing what your idea of a huge amount of money is - you will have to invest something if you want to expand your business .
however , there are many ways to reach a nationwide audience cost-effectively if you focus on the audience most likely to buy your clothes .
for example small ads in the back of fashion / lifestyle / music magazines , the back of club flyers , handing out flyers when clubs close .
have you looked at getting your website at the top of searches for " clubbing clothing " or whichever words you think most appropriate ?
freshers week is coming up and it would be worth investigating what it would cost to get a flyer included in the giveaway packs handed out to new students .
there are numerous ways to target students including student-specific websites , on which you place links .
as the products you sell are n't unique to your shop , concentrate on the service side .
make sure that whatever you send out is 100 % correct and is received promptly - make it very , very easy for people to use your site and get the right order every time .
think of what you can send with the order that might prompt another order e.g. a ' 10 % off ' voucher valid for the next order , or an added value item like a postcard of the character on their clothing .
once you have their address , and if they have agreed to receive further mail , you could send them e-mails or brochures , when new stock comes in .
keep the lines of communication open , friendly , fun , and relevant , backed up with great service and you will have happy customers .
return to the top question rich , uk i am a director within a small computer graphics company of just two directors and no further staff .
the company was started straight after university five years ago and we have had reasonable success after the initial financial hurdles .
however , we sometimes both feel that if we were better business ' managers ' and had the minds of business men , we would be millionaires by now !
do you know of any instances where small firms have ' brought in ' a manager to run the business , whilst not handing over the company on a plate ?
answer david wilkinson , partner , ernst & young one of the toughest challenges faced by growing companies is knowing when to bring in management that will help the business move into its next growth phase .
when you hire a manager on board , you will want to compensate them on the basis of their performance , and usually giving them a stake in the business is a good incentive .
there are many success stories of entrepreneurs who have had to make this difficult move , but who still remain wholly involved in the business , and who retain a majority stake .
however , with a business your size , it may be wiser to reach out in your own network and get some advice from someone with some business management expertise and perhaps bring them aboard as a non-executive .
it may be too early to bring a full-time manager on board .
there are a number of business plan proformas and guides that will help you structure your thoughts .
one such guide is ernst & young 's guide to producing a business plan , which can be found on our website : www.ey.com / uk / entrepreneur once you have a complete understanding of your business objectives , you can assess where you need particular assistance in moving your business forward .
return to the top question rupal rajani , england i have an idea / invention and am thinking of commissioning a company based in ireland to carry out a market research report for me .
how do i go about finding out if it is a reputable company or not ?
is there an organisation or body which i can contact ?
answer liz barclay , presenter of radio 4 's you and yours any reputable company you are thinking of employing in whatever field will expect you to check out its credentials .
ask for details of past clients you can talk to .
if it 's reputable there 's nothing to hide .
if you ask for that information and are refused , think twice .
check which market research body the firm belongs to and ask for the qualifications of the people you will be dealing with .
check them out .
your local chamber of commerce is often a good source of information about the activities of companies in its area but may know nothing about the company you want to use as it 's based in ireland .
question phil hayes , uk we are a small -lrb- £ 1.25m annual turnover -rrb- consultancy offering executive coaching and leadership training .
so far we have been successful -lrb- first five years -rrb- but this year we are finding it harder to win contracts .
should we niche our offer more or generalise it more ?
answer liz barclay , presenter of radio 4 's you and yours why are you finding it harder to win contracts ?
is it because of a general downturn in the market due to firms being more cautious in the current financial climate ?
are there other firms around your patch now offering something similar ?
have you somehow failed to keep up to date or ahead of the game - is it time to update your product ?
it 's time to take another look at the market you 're selling to - more market research .
talk to the companies you have successfully worked with in the past and find out whether they 're cutting back or looking for something new .
in a downturn , you may have to diversify a bit to bring in more customers , but you can go too far down that route and get too far away from your core activity , leaving the business vulnerable .
on the other hand if you do specialise more , you need to be sure that the market wants that specialism and that it 's giving you a unique selling point that your competitors do n't have .
return to the top question hk , england when a small business with flat management structure is taken over by a multinational firm with several tiers of management , what are the repercussions of it on the small firm , and in what way , if at all , can the working spirit of the current firm be retained ?
answer professor nigel nicholson , london business school this is a difficult situation .
first of all , the good news is that in most acquisitions the chief beneficiary -lrb- financially -rrb- is the acquired firm , and the chief loser is the acquirer .
this , of course , says nothing about the effects on culture , or ' working spirit ' as you put it .
to keep the spirit of an acquired company intact the acquirer has only two choices .
one : leave it be and protect it , as the pearl in its oyster .
two : capture and spread the spirit by giving its movers prime statuses in the integrated business .
neither is guaranteed to succeed , for big corporations have their own inexorable logic which drains the spirit out of companies like yours , unless they themselves have exceptional spirit , as some -lrb- but not enough -rrb- do .

much better that you and your son figure out a meaningful but hands-off role for you - such as new business development - that you can practice part-time . "
question tad stone , uk " i am involved in resettlement of prisoners at a d-category prison where i run business planning groups .
i am also a business adviser and run my own business .
we have terrible trouble opening business bank accounts for ex-prisoners , even though they do not want loans or overdrafts .
a current client who has been offered a prince 's trust loan is restarting a previously successful business after problems with the inland revenue .
his only crime was incompetence in bookkeeping .
we have arranged a bookkeeper , set up systems and he has a business mentor .
he has put together an excellent and very workable business plan , been thoroughly vetted by the prince 's trust , is putting in his own money , plus existing vehicles and tools valued at some £ 50k .
the only thing now preventing start-up is a bank account .
what do you suggest ? "
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking " at natwest we recognise that there are many reasons why customers may have had financial difficulties in the past and have adverse data registered against them .
we also recognise that this does not necessarily stop a new business venture from becoming successful .
we do offer business current accounts , without borrowing to all customers -lrb- apart from undischarged bankrupts and where there is evidence of deliberate fraud -rrb- irrespective of their credit standing .
our aim is to help businesses build up a track record after which we will consider borrowing requests . "
question greenham murage , uk " i am interested in starting a business which will mainly invest in africa and asia .
how do i finance the business ?
do banks like yours help small start-ups whose business does not target the uk market , but africa and other third-world countries ? "
answer peter ibbetson , head of natwest business banking " natwest looks to support commercially viable business propositions whether they are intending to trade just within the uk or further afield in europe and / or globally .
my advice is the same as it would be for any new business - planning and research are key .
additionally you will need to consider the possible language barriers , visa / work permit requirement , business legislation and any local customs .
you will also need to decide whether your business will trade in sterling , us dollars , euro or the local currency and how you will process payments between the uk and overseas .
i recommend that you discuss your proposition in full with your bank manager , accountant and legal adviser . "
the opinions expressed above are those of the panel of experts , not the bbc 's .
the advice is not intended to be definitive and should be used for guidance only .
always seek professional advice for your own particular situation .

it also suggests buying a home shredder to destroy documents like credit card applications , in case they fall into the wrong hands .
in its report , the fraud advisory panel argues that identity theft is such a serious problem that the government should allow the public sector and private firms to share data so they can protect themselves .
the crime can involve everything from the use of someone 's identity to apply for loans , to taking over the victim 's bank account or even obtaining passports and other documents in their name .
stolen passports the panel , which includes representatives from the police as well as the financial services , called on ministers to do more against identity crime .
steven philippsohn , of the panel 's cybercrime working group , said : " we believe the government should clarify through legal means those situations in which data-sharing between public sector and business organisations will be permitted . "
allowing cross-referencing of information on known fraudsters would help to track them down at an earlier stage , he said .
for example , if someone was using a stolen passport as proof of identity to take out a credit card or loan , the bank would be alerted through a shared database .
mr philippsohn said : " fear of the regulators swooping down is hindering attempts to reduce fraud by means of data-sharing . "
bogus websites the report also highlights online identity fraud as a major problem .
bogus websites which look like those run by well-known names can glean personal bank account details , it said .
the credit industry fraud avoidance system says identity fraud cases have increased dramatically - from 27,270 cases in 2001 to 42,029 in 2002 .
among the most famous cases was that of british pensioner derek bond , who spent nearly three weeks in a south african jail after a suspected american criminal used his identity .
mr bond was arrested when it was found he had the same name and passport number as the man wanted in connection with a telemarketing scheme which allegedly defrauded people of millions of dollars .

the adverts on us television and in cinemas feature makeup artists , set painters and other crafts people who explain that piracy deprives them of a living .
the motion picture association of america -lrb- mpaa -rrb- has also developed a curriculum on copyright for use in classrooms .
the film industry is hoping to avoid the debilitating effects of online piracy which has hit the record industry in the last few years .
the campaign asks people to " put an end to piracy " .
terminator 3 has been pirated online watch the campaign trailers " i do n't expect anyone to have sympathy for me or for other executives , " said peter chernin , president and chief operating officer of news corp , the parent firm of 20th century fox , which made the adverts .
" what we are endeavouring to do is both communicate that it 's wrong and also communicate that there are human stakes and that those stakes are not just millionaires making less millions . "
online movie piracy , while still a relatively small part of overall film piracy , is beginning to grow as internet connections become faster .
many blockbusters can be found pirated online , sometimes days before the films have even been released in cinemas .
experimenting film studios believe they still have a few years before internet connections become fast enough to threaten them .
studios are experimenting with new business models , including making films available legitimately online through services such as movielink .
it 's in the long term interest of people to understand there is no free lunch jack valenti , mpaa " we 're not sitting on our hands like the music business did , " mr chernin said .
" it may just be that consumers are n't quite ready yet to turn to the internet for movies , " said fred von lohmann , a lawyer for the electronic frontier foundation .
" but when they are , the answer will be to offer them a compelling legitimate alternative , not telling them to behave themselves , " he added .
the 30-second television advert will have its first run thursday night on all the main tv networks .
the first of several trailers will begin running friday in most major cinema chains around the us .
the first trailer features david goldstein , a set painter who says that piracy hurts him more than film industry executives .
each ad ends with the tag line : " movies .
they 're worth it . "
the campaign will also include a website that outlines the implications of illegal downloading as well as the legal and practical consequences .
" taking something that does n't belong to you is wrong , " said jack valenti , president of the mpaa .
" it 's in the long term interest of people to understand there is no free lunch . "

the french government is offering four million euro -lrb- £ 2.9m -rrb- to help aspiring game developers turn their ideas into reality .
in a statement , the ministry of culture said the money was aimed at helping french firms weather rough times in the global market for games .
" this is a sign from the government that they have realised there is a very strong potential for the games industry in france , " said frederic diot , a games industry analyst based in paris .
struggle to survive france has several games publishers which can compete with american giants like electronic arts and activision .
they include ubi soft , responsible for blockbusters like splinter cell and ghost recon . "
the government has tried to push broadband and the internet .
it is now trying to do the same with the game sector " philippe poutonnet , jupiter research the country is also home to infogrames , the largest interactive games publisher in europe and the parent company of atari .
these big companies are riding the current boom in video games sales .
but analysts say smaller french developers have been hit by the crash of the dot.com and have been struggling to recover .
" all the revenue is going into the hands of a decreasing number of companies , " said mr diot , " smaller ones are finding it increasingly hard to survive . "
a further obstacle is the rising costs of creating a successful game .
ten years ago , the average game cost £ 200,000 to develop , whereas now the average budget is more than £ 1m .
added to that , sales of personal computers and game consoles are lower in france than in neighbouring countries like the uk and germany .
it means that companies have to rely on making games that appeal to an international audience .
around 80 % of sales for french game makers come from abroad .
analysts say the french government is eager to encourage more people to get into computers and gaming .
" the government has tried to push broadband and the internet , " said philippe poutonnet , jupiter research analyst in paris , " and it is now trying to do the same with the game sector . "
strings attached the funds are aimed at encouraging home-grown talent to come up with new ideas for games and use innovative technology . "
governments will increasingly try to bring some support in some ways , even though it is going to be a bit controversial " frederic diot , games analyst the government will pay for up to 40 % of the cost of turning a concept into a working version of a game .
but there are strings attached to the millions of euros up for grabs .
to get a slice of the cash , firms have to be french and the work developing an idea must be done in france itself .
and there are limits to the sort of game the french government is willing to pay for .
it will not hand out grants for violent or pornographic games .
this effectively excludes a whole genre of gaming popular among young men such as grand theft auto titles .
these games reward players for raiding banks , beating up gangsters and paying off prostitutes .
they have proved to be some of the best-selling games of all time .
game developers have until 1 september to put forward their ideas .
analysts believe it is the first time the french state has ploughed funds into video games .
but they are sceptical about whether it is enough to help ailing developers .
" it will give some breathing space to the industry , " said mr poutonnet , " but in the long-term i do n't really see an improvement . "
more significantly , the decision is seen as a sign that the french government has recognised the value of its game industry .
countries like south korea already have been helping to grow a domestic video games industry and analysts say european countries are following suit .
" governments will increasingly try to bring some support in some ways , " said mr diot , " even though it is going to be a bit controversial . "

in a statement , the ministry of culture said the money was aimed at helping french firms weather rough times in the global market for games .

" all the revenue is going into the hands of a decreasing number of companies , " said mr diot , " smaller ones are finding it increasingly hard to survive . "

it will not hand out grants for violent or pornographic games .
this effectively excludes a whole genre of gaming popular among young men such as grand theft auto titles .
these games reward players for raiding banks , beating up gangsters and paying off prostitutes .
they have proved to be some of the best-selling games of all time .
game developers have until 1 september to put forward their ideas .
analysts believe it is the first time the french state has ploughed funds into video games .
but they are sceptical about whether it is enough to help ailing developers .
" it will give some breathing space to the industry , " said mr poutonnet , " but in the long-term i do n't really see an improvement . "

hartlepool youth offending service -lrb- yos -rrb- has joined forces with cleveland fire brigade to try to make teenagers aware of what can happen when they steal a car .
the scheme involves offenders watching , and taking part in , training exercises involving mock road accidents where casualties have to be rescued from vehicles .
the young people involved are all subject to reparation orders , sentences introduced as part of the crime and disorder act 1998 .
the sentences are designed to benefit the victims of crime directly or , if this is not possible , the community as a whole .
' real thing ' paul andrew , hartlepool yos reparation officer , said : " hopefully , this will make the young offenders think twice before committing car crimes again .
" car theft in the town is a fairly common problem which affects not only the owner of the vehicle involved , but also innocent members of the public and the emergency services .
" this scheme is designed to bring home to young offenders the potential consequences of their actions .
" this is as close as we can get to the real thing and the aim is to reflect the seriousness of this type of crime and the fact that it can easily result in a fatality . "
the scheme also gives firefighters a chance to explain the effects of car-related crime on them .
a spokesman for cleveland fire brigade said : " dealing with accidents involving casualties can be very harrowing for firefighters so we would welcome any initiative that might help to prevent them . "

davidii kakande landed at stansted airport three years ago .
he was immediately given asylum and moved to wrexham , north wales .
the 28-year-old was forced to leave his wife and children in the country governed by yoweri museveni .
" i was arrested and tortured several times , then i decided to escape .
when you are tortured you can sometimes get killed , " he said .
" i was arrested for opposing the government , i worked for a local newspaper which supported the main opposing party in uganda . "
people think if you come here , you are given a flat and you would never want to go back but i will " davidii kakande , ugandan refugee " if you oppose the authorities there is no freedom of speech .
if you try and write some news about the authority opposing some of the issues , you can end up in trouble .
" i did n't have any alternative because in time you can lose your life .
i had to escape the country .
" uganda is a very nice country but the situation 's different than here for some people . "
" there 's a lot of poverty in uganda , there are few jobs and few opportunities for people .
davidii was given refugee status 18 months ago , and says he will stay in his one bedroom flat not far from wrexham town centre for the foreseeable future .
however , he may not stay forever , and has concerns about the way asylum seekers and refugees are dealt with .
" i was happy in wrexham but now i am not so sure .
" i think to improve the system , it is better to listen attentively to the problems of refugees and asylum seekers and to take them seriously not just listen . "
he said he came to the uk because he can speak english and not because he sees the country as a " soft touch " .
" in uganda we are taught english in the schools , it is very easy to live here in the uk .
" you ca n't decide to go to germany or france because you do n't know any single word . "
" it 's strange to live in a foreign country because everything you see is a new thing .
" here they have never seen war since the second world war , nobody is torturing anybody , the government is a good one , " he added .
davidii was a sales manager and part time journalist in uganda .
since he left , democratic reforms in uganda have increased , and the media there now has greater freedom - changes which davidii says encourage him to return one day .
" i think if the situation changes like i think it will , i will go back , that 's why i want to get a degree .
" i 'd like to be an mp in uganda , i would like to do something for my own area .
" people think if you come here , you are given a flat and you would never want to go back but i will . "
he is in touch by phone and letter with his wife and two children , who have now also left uganda .
he is obviously keen to be reunited with them , and misses the lifestyle he had in his home town .
" i had a nice house and a nice car but i have n't got anything here .
" it 's a nice place but home is the best . "
