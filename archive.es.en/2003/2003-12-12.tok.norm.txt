u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .
“ it would n't be in line with the spirit of looking to the future together and not into the past , ” a spokesman for chancellor schroeder told reuters . both france and the european commission said they would look at the u.s. decision to see whether it complied with traditional international rules on government procurement . bush is also reportedly irked by the pentagon ’ s timing on the matter , since he had been planning to use the calls to encourage france , germany and russia to forgive old iraqi debts .
but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same . once again , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz seems to have fired too quickly by saying that those who didn ’ t participate in the american war on iraq shouldn ’ t hope to get money and contracts from the iraqi reconstruction fund .
the statement surely was more than just a tactical mistake now that the rift between washington , berlin , paris and moscow has been painfully mended .
a sure sign of that are george w. bush ’ s quick phone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to avert even greater damage .
old europe ’ s hypocrisy but actually wolfowitz didn ’ t do anything the now indignant and angry europeans , who even threatened to invoke international trade law , would not do if put in the same position .
when europeans hand out development aid , they usually require the recipient to do his shopping with them .
" old europe " also sulked less than a year ago when the " new europeans " in warsaw used eu funds to buy u.s. planes .
why should washington do things differently in the case of iraq ?
especially since the money comes from american taxpayers and george w. bush has to make sure that it benefits the domestic economy during his pre-re-election campaign .
to quote international law in this case is more than risky as there is no sign that it would help the spurned europeans : first , there ’ s the hague conventions and the geneva convention , both of which deal with the treatment of occupied territory .
they clearly state that occupying powers have a duty to improve living conditions in the areas they control .
that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .
but the iraqis are unlikely to handle things differently in the future .

the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same . once again , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz seems to have fired too quickly by saying that those who didn ’ t participate in the american war on iraq shouldn ’ t hope to get money and contracts from the iraqi reconstruction fund .
the statement surely was more than just a tactical mistake now that the rift between washington , berlin , paris and moscow has been painfully mended .
a sure sign of that are george w. bush ’ s quick phone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to avert even greater damage .
old europe ’ s hypocrisy but actually wolfowitz didn ’ t do anything the now indignant and angry europeans , who even threatened to invoke international trade law , would not do if put in the same position .
when europeans hand out development aid , they usually require the recipient to do his shopping with them .
" old europe " also sulked less than a year ago when the " new europeans " in warsaw used eu funds to buy u.s. planes .
why should washington do things differently in the case of iraq ?
especially since the money comes from american taxpayers and george w. bush has to make sure that it benefits the domestic economy during his pre-re-election campaign .
to quote international law in this case is more than risky as there is no sign that it would help the spurned europeans : first , there ’ s the hague conventions and the geneva convention , both of which deal with the treatment of occupied territory .
they clearly state that occupying powers have a duty to improve living conditions in the areas they control .
that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .
but the iraqis are unlikely to handle things differently in the future .
they will probably still remember that under different circumstances , germany , france and russia benefited from doing business with iraq - saddam hussein ’ s iraq .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .
“ it would n't be in line with the spirit of looking to the future together and not into the past , ” a spokesman for chancellor schroeder told reuters . both france and the european commission said they would look at the u.s. decision to see whether it complied with traditional international rules on government procurement . bush is also reportedly irked by the pentagon ’ s timing on the matter , since he had been planning to use the calls to encourage france , germany and russia to forgive old iraqi debts .
but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .
-lrb- december 10 , 2003 -rrb- opinion : u.s. has right to choose iraq contractors the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same .

the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .

the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .
“ it would n't be in line with the spirit of looking to the future together and not into the past , ” a spokesman for chancellor schroeder told reuters . both france and the european commission said they would look at the u.s. decision to see whether it complied with traditional international rules on government procurement . bush is also reportedly irked by the pentagon ’ s timing on the matter , since he had been planning to use the calls to encourage france , germany and russia to forgive old iraqi debts .
but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

sanader , whose center-right hdz party won 66 of 160 parliamentary seats in elections held two weeks ago , must now piece together a ruling coalition .
the hdz has won the backing of six other parties , giving it a slim majority in the new parliament , although it still has to agree on the distribution of cabinet posts .
the hdz says it has abandoned the extremist nationalist policies of its former head , the late ex-president franjo tudjman , who led croatia into international isolation until his death in 1999 .
sanader says his government 's priorities will be raising living standards at home , resolving unsettled issues with neighbors and acquiring eu membership .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .
“ it would n't be in line with the spirit of looking to the future together and not into the past , ” a spokesman for chancellor schroeder told reuters . both france and the european commission said they would look at the u.s. decision to see whether it complied with traditional international rules on government procurement . bush is also reportedly irked by the pentagon ’ s timing on the matter , since he had been planning to use the calls to encourage france , germany and russia to forgive old iraqi debts .
but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .

the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same . once again , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz seems to have fired too quickly by saying that those who didn ’ t participate in the american war on iraq shouldn ’ t hope to get money and contracts from the iraqi reconstruction fund .
the statement surely was more than just a tactical mistake now that the rift between washington , berlin , paris and moscow has been painfully mended .
a sure sign of that are george w. bush ’ s quick phone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to avert even greater damage .
old europe ’ s hypocrisy but actually wolfowitz didn ’ t do anything the now indignant and angry europeans , who even threatened to invoke international trade law , would not do if put in the same position .
when europeans hand out development aid , they usually require the recipient to do his shopping with them .
" old europe " also sulked less than a year ago when the " new europeans " in warsaw used eu funds to buy u.s. planes .
why should washington do things differently in the case of iraq ?
especially since the money comes from american taxpayers and george w. bush has to make sure that it benefits the domestic economy during his pre-re-election campaign .
to quote international law in this case is more than risky as there is no sign that it would help the spurned europeans : first , there ’ s the hague conventions and the geneva convention , both of which deal with the treatment of occupied territory .
they clearly state that occupying powers have a duty to improve living conditions in the areas they control .
that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .
but the iraqis are unlikely to handle things differently in the future .
they will probably still remember that under different circumstances , germany , france and russia benefited from doing business with iraq - saddam hussein ’ s iraq .

the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .

the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .

at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.12.2003 mzoudi decision generates criticism and skepticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi was just one of those stunned by the hamburg court 's decision to release him .
the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .

the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .

" there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .

the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .

the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same . once again , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz seems to have fired too quickly by saying that those who didn ’ t participate in the american war on iraq shouldn ’ t hope to get money and contracts from the iraqi reconstruction fund .
the statement surely was more than just a tactical mistake now that the rift between washington , berlin , paris and moscow has been painfully mended .
a sure sign of that are george w. bush ’ s quick phone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to avert even greater damage .
old europe ’ s hypocrisy but actually wolfowitz didn ’ t do anything the now indignant and angry europeans , who even threatened to invoke international trade law , would not do if put in the same position .
when europeans hand out development aid , they usually require the recipient to do his shopping with them .
" old europe " also sulked less than a year ago when the " new europeans " in warsaw used eu funds to buy u.s. planes .
why should washington do things differently in the case of iraq ?
especially since the money comes from american taxpayers and george w. bush has to make sure that it benefits the domestic economy during his pre-re-election campaign .
to quote international law in this case is more than risky as there is no sign that it would help the spurned europeans : first , there ’ s the hague conventions and the geneva convention , both of which deal with the treatment of occupied territory .
they clearly state that occupying powers have a duty to improve living conditions in the areas they control .
that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .

the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same . once again , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz seems to have fired too quickly by saying that those who didn ’ t participate in the american war on iraq shouldn ’ t hope to get money and contracts from the iraqi reconstruction fund .
the statement surely was more than just a tactical mistake now that the rift between washington , berlin , paris and moscow has been painfully mended .
a sure sign of that are george w. bush ’ s quick phone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to avert even greater damage .
old europe ’ s hypocrisy but actually wolfowitz didn ’ t do anything the now indignant and angry europeans , who even threatened to invoke international trade law , would not do if put in the same position .
when europeans hand out development aid , they usually require the recipient to do his shopping with them .
" old europe " also sulked less than a year ago when the " new europeans " in warsaw used eu funds to buy u.s. planes .
why should washington do things differently in the case of iraq ?
especially since the money comes from american taxpayers and george w. bush has to make sure that it benefits the domestic economy during his pre-re-election campaign .
to quote international law in this case is more than risky as there is no sign that it would help the spurned europeans : first , there ’ s the hague conventions and the geneva convention , both of which deal with the treatment of occupied territory .
they clearly state that occupying powers have a duty to improve living conditions in the areas they control .
that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .
but the iraqis are unlikely to handle things differently in the future .
they will probably still remember that under different circumstances , germany , france and russia benefited from doing business with iraq - saddam hussein ’ s iraq .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .
“ it would n't be in line with the spirit of looking to the future together and not into the past , ” a spokesman for chancellor schroeder told reuters . both france and the european commission said they would look at the u.s. decision to see whether it complied with traditional international rules on government procurement . bush is also reportedly irked by the pentagon ’ s timing on the matter , since he had been planning to use the calls to encourage france , germany and russia to forgive old iraqi debts .
but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .
“ it would n't be in line with the spirit of looking to the future together and not into the past , ” a spokesman for chancellor schroeder told reuters . both france and the european commission said they would look at the u.s. decision to see whether it complied with traditional international rules on government procurement . bush is also reportedly irked by the pentagon ’ s timing on the matter , since he had been planning to use the calls to encourage france , germany and russia to forgive old iraqi debts .
but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

sanader , whose center-right hdz party won 66 of 160 parliamentary seats in elections held two weeks ago , must now piece together a ruling coalition .
the hdz has won the backing of six other parties , giving it a slim majority in the new parliament , although it still has to agree on the distribution of cabinet posts .
the hdz says it has abandoned the extremist nationalist policies of its former head , the late ex-president franjo tudjman , who led croatia into international isolation until his death in 1999 .
sanader says his government 's priorities will be raising living standards at home , resolving unsettled issues with neighbors and acquiring eu membership .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.12.2003 mzoudi decision generates criticism and skepticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi was just one of those stunned by the hamburg court 's decision to release him .
the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .
" we had not counted on it happening this way , however , we are happy about the right decision , " said defense lawyer gül pinar in a statement after the court ’ s announcement . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second hamburg terror trial begins the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .

the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same . once again , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz seems to have fired too quickly by saying that those who didn ’ t participate in the american war on iraq shouldn ’ t hope to get money and contracts from the iraqi reconstruction fund .
the statement surely was more than just a tactical mistake now that the rift between washington , berlin , paris and moscow has been painfully mended .
a sure sign of that are george w. bush ’ s quick phone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to avert even greater damage .
old europe ’ s hypocrisy but actually wolfowitz didn ’ t do anything the now indignant and angry europeans , who even threatened to invoke international trade law , would not do if put in the same position .
when europeans hand out development aid , they usually require the recipient to do his shopping with them .
" old europe " also sulked less than a year ago when the " new europeans " in warsaw used eu funds to buy u.s. planes .
why should washington do things differently in the case of iraq ?
especially since the money comes from american taxpayers and george w. bush has to make sure that it benefits the domestic economy during his pre-re-election campaign .
to quote international law in this case is more than risky as there is no sign that it would help the spurned europeans : first , there ’ s the hague conventions and the geneva convention , both of which deal with the treatment of occupied territory .
they clearly state that occupying powers have a duty to improve living conditions in the areas they control .
that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .
but the iraqis are unlikely to handle things differently in the future .

that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .
but the iraqis are unlikely to handle things differently in the future .
they will probably still remember that under different circumstances , germany , france and russia benefited from doing business with iraq - saddam hussein ’ s iraq .

the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .

but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .

the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same . once again , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz seems to have fired too quickly by saying that those who didn ’ t participate in the american war on iraq shouldn ’ t hope to get money and contracts from the iraqi reconstruction fund .
the statement surely was more than just a tactical mistake now that the rift between washington , berlin , paris and moscow has been painfully mended .
a sure sign of that are george w. bush ’ s quick phone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to avert even greater damage .
old europe ’ s hypocrisy but actually wolfowitz didn ’ t do anything the now indignant and angry europeans , who even threatened to invoke international trade law , would not do if put in the same position .
when europeans hand out development aid , they usually require the recipient to do his shopping with them .
" old europe " also sulked less than a year ago when the " new europeans " in warsaw used eu funds to buy u.s. planes .
why should washington do things differently in the case of iraq ?
especially since the money comes from american taxpayers and george w. bush has to make sure that it benefits the domestic economy during his pre-re-election campaign .
to quote international law in this case is more than risky as there is no sign that it would help the spurned europeans : first , there ’ s the hague conventions and the geneva convention , both of which deal with the treatment of occupied territory .
they clearly state that occupying powers have a duty to improve living conditions in the areas they control .
that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .
but the iraqis are unlikely to handle things differently in the future .
they will probably still remember that under different circumstances , germany , france and russia benefited from doing business with iraq - saddam hussein ’ s iraq .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .
“ it would n't be in line with the spirit of looking to the future together and not into the past , ” a spokesman for chancellor schroeder told reuters . both france and the european commission said they would look at the u.s. decision to see whether it complied with traditional international rules on government procurement . bush is also reportedly irked by the pentagon ’ s timing on the matter , since he had been planning to use the calls to encourage france , germany and russia to forgive old iraqi debts .
but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

sanader , whose center-right hdz party won 66 of 160 parliamentary seats in elections held two weeks ago , must now piece together a ruling coalition .
the hdz has won the backing of six other parties , giving it a slim majority in the new parliament , although it still has to agree on the distribution of cabinet posts .
the hdz says it has abandoned the extremist nationalist policies of its former head , the late ex-president franjo tudjman , who led croatia into international isolation until his death in 1999 .
sanader says his government 's priorities will be raising living standards at home , resolving unsettled issues with neighbors and acquiring eu membership .

the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .

suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks .

the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .
“ it would n't be in line with the spirit of looking to the future together and not into the past , ” a spokesman for chancellor schroeder told reuters . both france and the european commission said they would look at the u.s. decision to see whether it complied with traditional international rules on government procurement . bush is also reportedly irked by the pentagon ’ s timing on the matter , since he had been planning to use the calls to encourage france , germany and russia to forgive old iraqi debts .
but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .

the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .

mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .
“ it would n't be in line with the spirit of looking to the future together and not into the past , ” a spokesman for chancellor schroeder told reuters . both france and the european commission said they would look at the u.s. decision to see whether it complied with traditional international rules on government procurement . bush is also reportedly irked by the pentagon ’ s timing on the matter , since he had been planning to use the calls to encourage france , germany and russia to forgive old iraqi debts .
but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

sanader , whose center-right hdz party won 66 of 160 parliamentary seats in elections held two weeks ago , must now piece together a ruling coalition .
the hdz has won the backing of six other parties , giving it a slim majority in the new parliament , although it still has to agree on the distribution of cabinet posts .
the hdz says it has abandoned the extremist nationalist policies of its former head , the late ex-president franjo tudjman , who led croatia into international isolation until his death in 1999 .
sanader says his government 's priorities will be raising living standards at home , resolving unsettled issues with neighbors and acquiring eu membership .

the hdz has won the backing of six other parties , giving it a slim majority in the new parliament , although it still has to agree on the distribution of cabinet posts .
the hdz says it has abandoned the extremist nationalist policies of its former head , the late ex-president franjo tudjman , who led croatia into international isolation until his death in 1999 .
sanader says his government 's priorities will be raising living standards at home , resolving unsettled issues with neighbors and acquiring eu membership .

the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same . once again , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz seems to have fired too quickly by saying that those who didn ’ t participate in the american war on iraq shouldn ’ t hope to get money and contracts from the iraqi reconstruction fund .
the statement surely was more than just a tactical mistake now that the rift between washington , berlin , paris and moscow has been painfully mended .
a sure sign of that are george w. bush ’ s quick phone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to avert even greater damage .
old europe ’ s hypocrisy but actually wolfowitz didn ’ t do anything the now indignant and angry europeans , who even threatened to invoke international trade law , would not do if put in the same position .
when europeans hand out development aid , they usually require the recipient to do his shopping with them .
" old europe " also sulked less than a year ago when the " new europeans " in warsaw used eu funds to buy u.s. planes .
why should washington do things differently in the case of iraq ?
especially since the money comes from american taxpayers and george w. bush has to make sure that it benefits the domestic economy during his pre-re-election campaign .
to quote international law in this case is more than risky as there is no sign that it would help the spurned europeans : first , there ’ s the hague conventions and the geneva convention , both of which deal with the treatment of occupied territory .
they clearly state that occupying powers have a duty to improve living conditions in the areas they control .
that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .
but the iraqis are unlikely to handle things differently in the future .
they will probably still remember that under different circumstances , germany , france and russia benefited from doing business with iraq - saddam hussein ’ s iraq .

the agreement , reached on thursday , says that the european union will have its own military planning cell , but this will only be used as a last resort and will not become a fully fledged military headquarters .
washington had previously expressed concerns , shared by the united kingdom , that the new military arm of the eu could undermine the nato alliance .
the deal indicates that , when carrying out military operations , the eu will always in the first instance consider using nato facilities .
if that is not appropriate , then the eu will resort to using the existing facilities in member states .
it would only set up its own planning cell to carry out an operation as a last resort .

the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same . once again , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz seems to have fired too quickly by saying that those who didn ’ t participate in the american war on iraq shouldn ’ t hope to get money and contracts from the iraqi reconstruction fund .
the statement surely was more than just a tactical mistake now that the rift between washington , berlin , paris and moscow has been painfully mended .
a sure sign of that are george w. bush ’ s quick phone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to avert even greater damage .
old europe ’ s hypocrisy but actually wolfowitz didn ’ t do anything the now indignant and angry europeans , who even threatened to invoke international trade law , would not do if put in the same position .
when europeans hand out development aid , they usually require the recipient to do his shopping with them .
" old europe " also sulked less than a year ago when the " new europeans " in warsaw used eu funds to buy u.s. planes .
why should washington do things differently in the case of iraq ?
especially since the money comes from american taxpayers and george w. bush has to make sure that it benefits the domestic economy during his pre-re-election campaign .
to quote international law in this case is more than risky as there is no sign that it would help the spurned europeans : first , there ’ s the hague conventions and the geneva convention , both of which deal with the treatment of occupied territory .
they clearly state that occupying powers have a duty to improve living conditions in the areas they control .
that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .
but the iraqis are unlikely to handle things differently in the future .
they will probably still remember that under different circumstances , germany , france and russia benefited from doing business with iraq - saddam hussein ’ s iraq .

the recently published federal forest report states that only one third of all trees in germany ’ s woods are healthy , around 31 percent of the country ’ s forestation , down from 35 percent 2002 .
high temperatures , long persistent dryness of soil and increasing ozone levels have particularly hit the nation ’ s oak trees with a reported 83 percent falling ill , an increase of 10 percent on 2002 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.12.2003 opinion : u.s. has right to choose iraq contractors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction in iraq has begun in earnest , but many european firms are being left out .
the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same . once again , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz seems to have fired too quickly by saying that those who didn ’ t participate in the american war on iraq shouldn ’ t hope to get money and contracts from the iraqi reconstruction fund .
the statement surely was more than just a tactical mistake now that the rift between washington , berlin , paris and moscow has been painfully mended .
a sure sign of that are george w. bush ’ s quick phone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to avert even greater damage .
old europe ’ s hypocrisy but actually wolfowitz didn ’ t do anything the now indignant and angry europeans , who even threatened to invoke international trade law , would not do if put in the same position .
when europeans hand out development aid , they usually require the recipient to do his shopping with them .
" old europe " also sulked less than a year ago when the " new europeans " in warsaw used eu funds to buy u.s. planes .
why should washington do things differently in the case of iraq ?
especially since the money comes from american taxpayers and george w. bush has to make sure that it benefits the domestic economy during his pre-re-election campaign .
to quote international law in this case is more than risky as there is no sign that it would help the spurned europeans : first , there ’ s the hague conventions and the geneva convention , both of which deal with the treatment of occupied territory .
they clearly state that occupying powers have a duty to improve living conditions in the areas they control .
that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .
but the iraqis are unlikely to handle things differently in the future .
they will probably still remember that under different circumstances , germany , france and russia benefited from doing business with iraq - saddam hussein ’ s iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.12.2003 opinion : u.s. has right to choose iraq contractors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction in iraq has begun in earnest , but many european firms are being left out .
the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same . once again , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz seems to have fired too quickly by saying that those who didn ’ t participate in the american war on iraq shouldn ’ t hope to get money and contracts from the iraqi reconstruction fund .
the statement surely was more than just a tactical mistake now that the rift between washington , berlin , paris and moscow has been painfully mended .
a sure sign of that are george w. bush ’ s quick phone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to avert even greater damage .
old europe ’ s hypocrisy but actually wolfowitz didn ’ t do anything the now indignant and angry europeans , who even threatened to invoke international trade law , would not do if put in the same position .
when europeans hand out development aid , they usually require the recipient to do his shopping with them .
" old europe " also sulked less than a year ago when the " new europeans " in warsaw used eu funds to buy u.s. planes .
why should washington do things differently in the case of iraq ?
especially since the money comes from american taxpayers and george w. bush has to make sure that it benefits the domestic economy during his pre-re-election campaign .
to quote international law in this case is more than risky as there is no sign that it would help the spurned europeans : first , there ’ s the hague conventions and the geneva convention , both of which deal with the treatment of occupied territory .
they clearly state that occupying powers have a duty to improve living conditions in the areas they control .
that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .
but the iraqis are unlikely to handle things differently in the future .
they will probably still remember that under different circumstances , germany , france and russia benefited from doing business with iraq - saddam hussein ’ s iraq .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.12.2003 mzoudi decision generates criticism and skepticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi was just one of those stunned by the hamburg court 's decision to release him .
the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .
" we had not counted on it happening this way , however , we are happy about the right decision , " said defense lawyer gül pinar in a statement after the court ’ s announcement . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second hamburg terror trial begins the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.12.2003 opinion : u.s. has right to choose iraq contractors großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction in iraq has begun in earnest , but many european firms are being left out .
the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same . once again , u.s. deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz seems to have fired too quickly by saying that those who didn ’ t participate in the american war on iraq shouldn ’ t hope to get money and contracts from the iraqi reconstruction fund .
the statement surely was more than just a tactical mistake now that the rift between washington , berlin , paris and moscow has been painfully mended .
a sure sign of that are george w. bush ’ s quick phone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to avert even greater damage .
old europe ’ s hypocrisy but actually wolfowitz didn ’ t do anything the now indignant and angry europeans , who even threatened to invoke international trade law , would not do if put in the same position .
when europeans hand out development aid , they usually require the recipient to do his shopping with them .
" old europe " also sulked less than a year ago when the " new europeans " in warsaw used eu funds to buy u.s. planes .
why should washington do things differently in the case of iraq ?
especially since the money comes from american taxpayers and george w. bush has to make sure that it benefits the domestic economy during his pre-re-election campaign .
to quote international law in this case is more than risky as there is no sign that it would help the spurned europeans : first , there ’ s the hague conventions and the geneva convention , both of which deal with the treatment of occupied territory .
they clearly state that occupying powers have a duty to improve living conditions in the areas they control .
that includes reconstructing destroyed infrastructure , creating jobs and making life easier for the people affected .
failing to step up to the plate europeans themselves had reminded the americans of these duties before the latter began waging a war in iraq .
they probably did so to avoid having to shoulder some of the reconstruction costs themselves .
when donor nations gathered in madrid , germany , france and russia shone by holding back .
the u.s. on the other hand took on two-thirds of the agreed upon $ 30 billion -lrb- € 24.6 billion . -rrb-
so why are europeans all of a sudden desperate to get a part of the action , which will overwhelmingly be paid for by the americans ?
the real clever ones even argue that banning european firms will harm iraqis in the end .
as if german , french or even russian phones work better than american ones .
in madrid , a representative of iraq ’ s governing council warned that his countrymen would definitely remember who helped and who didn ’ t .
washington , in accordance with international law , is still making the decisions for the time being .
but the iraqis are unlikely to handle things differently in the future .
they will probably still remember that under different circumstances , germany , france and russia benefited from doing business with iraq - saddam hussein ’ s iraq .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .
“ it would n't be in line with the spirit of looking to the future together and not into the past , ” a spokesman for chancellor schroeder told reuters . both france and the european commission said they would look at the u.s. decision to see whether it complied with traditional international rules on government procurement . bush is also reportedly irked by the pentagon ’ s timing on the matter , since he had been planning to use the calls to encourage france , germany and russia to forgive old iraqi debts .
but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .
“ it would n't be in line with the spirit of looking to the future together and not into the past , ” a spokesman for chancellor schroeder told reuters . both france and the european commission said they would look at the u.s. decision to see whether it complied with traditional international rules on government procurement . bush is also reportedly irked by the pentagon ’ s timing on the matter , since he had been planning to use the calls to encourage france , germany and russia to forgive old iraqi debts .
but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 12.12.2003 mzoudi decision generates criticism and skepticism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdelghani mzoudi was just one of those stunned by the hamburg court 's decision to release him .
the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .

the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .

the release of suspected terrorist abelghani mzoudi has caused concern and disappointment on both sides of the atlantic as the 9/11 prosecution faces its first major setback . the hamburg court ’ s decision to release suspected 9/11 accomplice abelghani mzoudi , the man accused of involvement in the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states and only the second person in the world to stand trial over the attacks , has drawn criticism and skepticism from authority figures involved in the investigation and prosecution of suspected terrorists .
mzoudi , after mzoudi was effectively cleared of complicity in the murder of over 3000 people , chief german federal prosecutor kay nehm came out with comments questioning the decision of the court to base the release on evidence submitted by an unknown witness .
court should have taken more time , says nehm " i do n't think the court was well advised , " nehm told german state broadcaster ard television .
" i think the judge would have been well-advised if he had slept on the decision for a night .
-lrb- the court -rrb- should have reflected on what was really in this statement and then carefully checked how all that fitted in with the evidence in the proceedings so far . " " the -lrb- mzoudi -rrb- release was quite surprising for everyone involved in the process . "
nehm said adding that a similar situation should not happen under the u.s. court system in which al qaeda suspect zacarias moussaoui is facing trial for his alleged role in the 9/11 attacks . he refused to comment on whether the decision of the hamburg court would have any immediate effect on the sentence of mounir al mossadeq who is currently incarcerated in germany on identical charges to mzoudi after being sentenced to 15 years in jail last february for plotting with the 11 september hijackers . al mossadeq ’ s representatives immediately called for his release as the news concerning mzoudi ’ s trial broke .
“ we will make an immediate move to get him out - this is clear , " josef graessle-muenscher told reuters on thursday .
ashcroft expresses concern the decision was expected to infuriate the u.s. which previously praised the germans for their work in the investigation into the hamburg cell and their wider work in the " war on terror . "
however , when u.s. attorney general john ashcroft was asked at a news conference about the hamburg decision , he resisted the urge to condemn , choosing only to express his concern about the decision and to insist it would not jeopardize the prosecution of moussaoui .
" i am disappointed this case in germany has taken the turn it has taken , " ashcroft said .
" our system is literally constructed so that when we encounter a circumstance like they encountered in germany , there are ways in which that is ... resolved at a higher level . "
" we believe our system can work and work effectively , and we 're proceeding forward on that basis , " he added .
suspect freed on anonymous testimony mzoudi was released from his pre-trial custody on thursday to the astonishment of all those gathered in the hamburg courtroom .
judge klaus ruehle , in possession of new evidence provided by the federal criminal investigation bureau -lrb- bka -rrb- , said the testimony of one particular witness in the case " clearly exonerates " mzoudi from the accusations that he was a knowing collaborator of the hamburg al qaeda cell which carried out the attacks in the united states in 2001 . the source of the new evidence continues to stir debate because the only name attached to it is the bka , with no witness explicitly identified in the document .
speculation surrounds the identity of the source , although one of al qaeda 's mastermind planners , ramzi binalshibh , has been implied by the hamburg state prosecutor and an number of media outlets . evidence suggests a four-man cell the new evidence suggests that there were only four people in the hamburg cell , three of whom were suicide pilots in the attacks on new york and washington - mohammed atta , marwan al-shehhi and ziad jarrah - and the fourth being binalshibh himself , currently in u.s. detention charged with being the coordinator of the attack .
while apparently exonerating mzoudi from the alleged four-man cell , the information strongly hints at binalshibh as the source . the release decision , based on evidence supposedly from binalshibh , is all the more surprising due to recent attempts by the defense teams of both mzoudi and mounir al-motassadeq , the only other suspect being held on charges surrounding the attacks , to hear evidence from binalshibh . only last month , the hamburg court rejected an application from mzoudi ’ s defense attorneys to present statements of imprisoned al qaeda members . authority report presents evidence to court half an hour before the hearing was to convene on thursday morning ; the fax machine at the hamburg court burst into life and effectively overruled that decision .
at 8.28 a.m. , a so-called " authority report " from the bka began to churn from the machine containing testimony believed to be from binalshibh . barely three and a half hours later , judge ruehle told the court that the arrest warrant for mzoudi had been lifted as there was no further reason for his detention under the charge of being an accessory in the attacks . " there is the serious possibility that mzoudi was purposefully left out of the attack plans despite his links to the hamburg group and despite his stay in afghanistan and that his supportive actions were not consciously made , " ruehle said . caution over binalshibh evidence state prosecutor walter hemberger , who immediately opposed the request for mzoudi 's release , reacted quickly to the speculation that the evidence that had led to the suspect ’ s release had come from binalshibh .
hemberger said that binalshibh 's word could not be trusted , and was likely to be motivated by a desire to protect others and cover up details of the plot . however , mzoudi 's lawyers have argued that , even without the new evidence , it would have been proved that their client simply helped fellow muslims and had no idea about a hijack plot .
" we had not counted on it happening this way , however , we are happy about the right decision , " said defense lawyer gül pinar in a statement after the court ’ s announcement . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de second hamburg terror trial begins the second trial of a suspected member of the hamburg terror cell involved in the september 11 attacks opened in hamburg on thursday .

u.s. president george bush spoke with the leaders of germany , france and russia on wednesday , one day after washington chose to shut out those countries ’ companies from lucrative iraqi reconstruction contracts . bush had planned to use the pre-scheduled telephone calls to berlin , paris and moscow to push the three leading opponents of the war in iraq to forgive baghdad ’ s debt .
but the pentagon ’ s decision on tuesday to release a memo excluding all the firms from all nations that failed to support washington ’ s military efforts put the white house in damage control mode . according to a u.s. government spokesman , bush told german chancellor gerhard schröder , french president jacques chirac and russian president vladimir putin that he planned “ to keep the lines of communication open ” regarding the contracts .
bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .

bush also reportedly tried to present the new policy as an invitation to other countries to join washington ’ s camp rather than a form of punishment . all three european leaders had been angered by u.s. deputy defense secretary paul wolfowitz ’ s announcement on tuesday that only firms from a list of 63 nations that would able to take part in iraqi reconstruction efforts being funded by the u.s. government worth some $ 18.6 billion -lrb- € 15.2 billion -rrb- . wolfowitz said the action was vital to protecting the united states ’ “ essential ” security interests , but many observers saw it as the bush administration making good on a threat that those nations that opposed the u.s.-led campaign to oust iraqi dictator saddam hussein would not play a large role in the rebuilding of the country . new transatlantic row ? the matter has raised the specter of rekindling the simmering transatlantic row caused by disagreement over the war .
germany , like the countries similarly affected , called the exclusion unacceptable .
“ it would n't be in line with the spirit of looking to the future together and not into the past , ” a spokesman for chancellor schroeder told reuters . both france and the european commission said they would look at the u.s. decision to see whether it complied with traditional international rules on government procurement . bush is also reportedly irked by the pentagon ’ s timing on the matter , since he had been planning to use the calls to encourage france , germany and russia to forgive old iraqi debts .
but he apparently approved the decision and white house press secretary scott mcclellan defended the exclusion policy on wednesday . “ i think it 's only appropriate that those countries that have been involved with the united states from the beginning and the iraqi people and those who are contributing forces to the efforts in iraq would be the ones that would be eligible for the prime contracts funded by u.s. taxpayer dollars , ” mcclellan told a press briefing . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de u.s. bars germany , france from iraqi reconstruction contracts the united states said tuesday only companies from countries that supported the war in iraq would be allowed to bid for large reconstruction contracts , effectively excluding firms from war opponents germany and france .
-lrb- december 10 , 2003 -rrb- opinion : u.s. has right to choose iraq contractors the united states government 's decision to hand iraqi reconstruction contracts to war allies has irked war opponents in " old europe . "
but they probably would have done the same .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 12.12.2003 europe 's constitution takes shape for 16 months , the european convention , led by former french president and master draftsman valéry giscard d 'estaing , set about its work of drafting the european union 's first ever full-fledged constitution .
with the convention 's work completed , the draft must now be finalized by an intergovernmental conference of european leaders that is expected to complete deliberations by the end of the year .
however , quick ratification of the constitution is anything but certain – smaller eu members fear the it will centralize too much power with brussels and larger members like germany and france , and some medium sized countries , like poland and spain , have reservations about the constitution ’ s qualified majority voting method , which they say is " awkward . "
read dw-world 's full coverage of this historic document , the debate that has accompanied it and what the constitution will mean for the future of europe .

sanader , whose center-right hdz party won 66 of 160 parliamentary seats in elections held two weeks ago , must now piece together a ruling coalition .
the hdz has won the backing of six other parties , giving it a slim majority in the new parliament , although it still has to agree on the distribution of cabinet posts .
the hdz says it has abandoned the extremist nationalist policies of its former head , the late ex-president franjo tudjman , who led croatia into international isolation until his death in 1999 .
sanader says his government 's priorities will be raising living standards at home , resolving unsettled issues with neighbors and acquiring eu membership .

rail passengers ' council the most significant problems were on midland mainline services between london , the east midlands and yorkshire .

the company in charge of britain 's railway tracks - network rail - is to get an extra £ 22bn over the next five years .
the money has been approved by the rail regulator - and he says it 's the amount needed to make the system work properly .
tom winsor came in to the breakfast studio to explain why he 's being so generous with tax and fare payers ' cash .
a recording of our interview will be available shortly .
we also want to hear what you think : whether you 're a rail commuter , a day tripper or a motorist who never uses the railways at all. click here to go straight to our e-mail form yesterday , the strategic rail authority reported that long distance rail delays were up 5 % over the summer .
inter-city services were hit as speed limits were introduced to stop buckled rails derailing trains , the strategic rail authority announced on thursday .
despite these problems there was a 4.4 % improvement in punctuality by regional operators between july and september .
overall , eight out of 10 of trains ran on time over the three month period , the same total as last year .
significant problems the " on-time " figure fell 7 % for long-distance operators and 3 % for london and south-east england train companies , the sra said . "
as fares go up , the service that passengers get is not improving so why should they pay more ? "
rail passengers ' council the most significant problems were on midland mainline services between london , the east midlands and yorkshire .
the train operator was the worst performing company , with 63 % of trains on time , compared to 80 % last year .
a third of trains operated by virgin west coast and first great western also ran late .
the best performing company , apart from the tiny isle of wight operator island line , was merseyrail with 94 % of trains running on time .
improvements thursday 's performance figures follow the announcement that some passengers are facing fare rises of up to 9 % in the new year .
train companies and the government said the increases would be necessary to pay for much needed improvements .
most and least punctual most 1 .
island line -lrb- 96.7 % -rrb- 2 .
merseyrail -lrb- 94.2 % -rrb- 3 .
chiltern -lrb- 89.0 % -rrb- least 1 .
midland mainline -lrb- 62.9 % -rrb- 2 .
virgin west coast -lrb- 65.3 % -rrb- 3 .
first great western -lrb- 65.8 % -rrb- -lrb- based on % of trains on time -rrb- but passenger watchdogs are angry that customers are being asked to pay up-front for improvements , which they have yet to see a sign of .
rail passengers ' council chairman stewart francis said : " as fares go up , the service that passengers get is not improving so why should they pay more ?
" passengers want to know when their service is going to get better and by how much . "
' improvements needed ' rail leaders , too , are increasingly concerned about the growing number of delays caused by problems with tracks or signals .
sra chairman richard bowker said the rail industry must strive to improve the static overall performance figures .
he said : " we need to be ruthless in pursuit of improvement and change on behalf of the railway 's customers . "
complaints per 100,000 journeys decreased by 17 % , but overall satisfaction with the reliability and punctuality of trains , measured from autumn 2002 to this autumn , fell by 5 % . "
the overall performance figure remains static and we need to be ruthless in pursuit of improvement and change on behalf of the railway 's customers " sra satisfaction levels were lowest for silverlink and thameslink , both with 64 % .
the highest-rated company was gatwick express with nine out of 10 passengers satisfied .
midland mainline had the biggest fall in satisfaction levels - down 9 % .
the results follow a rail passengers ' conference in london on wednesday at which transport secretary alistair darling warned the rail industry must provide better services and " treat people as valued customers " .
he said there were improvements , but more choice and reliable , comfortable trains were essential .
his comments came as a survey by yougov for the rail passengers council showed growing pessimism among users .

oxford university scientists have suggested they may be able to draw on their namesakes to find a life-saving genetic match .
the human genetics study looked at using the international network of clans to help find suitable donors .
it found that clan members were more closely related to one another than previously thought .
dna tests found that 20 % of macdonalds worldwide were directly descended from their 12th century clan founder .

eight of the twelve members decided that they would resign in march next year after 80 labour members in the south wales constituency voted to select london union official maggie jones on thursday .
local party members insist she is not a legitimate candidate , but the move was taken in an effort to boost the numbers of female labour mps .
following a meeting on friday night , the senior vice chair , don wilcox , said the members who had decided to stand down were " not trying to destroy the constituency " but wanted to make their feelings heard in a " reasonable manner " .
llew smith mp - who will retire at the next general election - said ms jones should not have been selected .
" how can anyone claim to the labour candidate for the blaenau gwent labour party when only 10 % of the membership voted for her , and when 85 % boycotted the election process and refused to vote ? " , he asked .
eight will stand down don wilcox dai davies moira wilcox darren webb jen morgan ann richards peter chambers graham hughes but ms jones has said she is confident the party will get behind her , and hopes she can persuade local assembly member , peter law , not to stand against her as an independent candidate in the next election .
he still has not ruled out that possibility .
he has criticised the selection process and joined protesters outside ebbw vale leisure centre on thursday night .
welsh secretary peter hain described ms jones as " one of the labour and trade union movement 's most promising women trade unionists " .
and , he added : " she will give a powerful national voice to the people of blaenau gwent on issues like low pay and poverty where her union has such a distinguished record of achievement .
" maggie stands in the long socialist tradition of nye bevan and michael foot . "
first minister rhodri morgan added : ms jones is hoping to gain the local party 's support " maggie jones is an outstandingly gifted candidate , with her roots firmly in the valleys .
" her record as a trade unionist stands her in good stead , and i 'm sure she 'll be an outstanding mp for blaenau gwent and for wales . "
ms jones is originally from south wales , but works in london for the public sector union unison .
she told bbc wales she hoped gain the support of all local labour members .
" i think i would have been a good candidate whether or not there was an all-women shortlist , " she said .
" the fact that i was selected on this basis does n't make any difference .
" i will be a good candidate for blaenau gwent and i have got to prove myself now and i hope to do that . "
the blaenau gwent constituency is one of three in wales with retiring mps where welsh labour has decided to have all-women shortlists .

eight of the twelve members decided that they would resign in march next year after 80 labour members in the south wales constituency voted to select london union official maggie jones on thursday .
local party members insist she is not a legitimate candidate , but the move was taken in an effort to boost the numbers of female labour mps .
following a meeting on friday night , the senior vice chair , don wilcox , said the members who had decided to stand down were " not trying to destroy the constituency " but wanted to make their feelings heard in a " reasonable manner " .
llew smith mp - who will retire at the next general election - said ms jones should not have been selected .
" how can anyone claim to the labour candidate for the blaenau gwent labour party when only 10 % of the membership voted for her , and when 85 % boycotted the election process and refused to vote ? " , he asked .
eight will stand down don wilcox dai davies moira wilcox darren webb jen morgan ann richards peter chambers graham hughes but ms jones has said she is confident the party will get behind her , and hopes she can persuade local assembly member , peter law , not to stand against her as an independent candidate in the next election .
he still has not ruled out that possibility .
he has criticised the selection process and joined protesters outside ebbw vale leisure centre on thursday night .
welsh secretary peter hain described ms jones as " one of the labour and trade union movement 's most promising women trade unionists " .
and , he added : " she will give a powerful national voice to the people of blaenau gwent on issues like low pay and poverty where her union has such a distinguished record of achievement .
" maggie stands in the long socialist tradition of nye bevan and michael foot . "
first minister rhodri morgan added : ms jones is hoping to gain the local party 's support " maggie jones is an outstandingly gifted candidate , with her roots firmly in the valleys .
" her record as a trade unionist stands her in good stead , and i 'm sure she 'll be an outstanding mp for blaenau gwent and for wales . "
ms jones is originally from south wales , but works in london for the public sector union unison .
she told bbc wales she hoped gain the support of all local labour members .
" i think i would have been a good candidate whether or not there was an all-women shortlist , " she said .
" the fact that i was selected on this basis does n't make any difference .
" i will be a good candidate for blaenau gwent and i have got to prove myself now and i hope to do that . "
