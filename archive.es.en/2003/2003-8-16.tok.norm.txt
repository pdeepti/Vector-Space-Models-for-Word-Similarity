crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function . it ’ s an abbreviation that saves lives - usv , uninterrupted electricity flow - and it belongs to the standard equipment in every german hospital .
in the event of a total power outage as in the northeastern united states and canada , usv would immediately spring to life , pumping electricity to all the hospital ’ s intensive care machines with juice from a giant battery , but just for a brief moment .
only 15 seconds after a shutdown in the electricity network , the hospital ’ s own emergency power unit kicks into action .
a diesel motor and a generator form a mini power plant and take over the complete electricity production .
in this way an entire hospital complex can function for an extended period without relying on the public energy supply .
a giant three-day-tank holds enough diesel to carry the power unit through an initial emergency period , and every hospital is required to keep a reserve of diesel for at least 24 hours .
every month technicians conduct an hour-long test on the emergency power units , to check for maintenance problems and breaks in the circuitry .
all of this is required by law .
and most other institutions integral to the smooth functioning of german society , such as large banks , the deutsche bahn rail system and the airports , are also outfitted with such equipment .
experts say germany could quickly respond to a widespread blackout , although there has never been a real test of the system .
statistics , however , speak for themselves , they argue , and compared to other industrialized nations , germany has had the lowest number of minutes of electrical failure in the past year , just 15 .
keeping things running unlike in the hospitals , the business conducted in the commerzbank in frankfurt is not about life or death .
but the situation could nevertheless become pretty dramatic for the people working in europe ’ s largest office building .
that ’ s why a special emergency power unit was installed for the unlikely event of a complete blackout .
at the most a couple hundred computers would shut down when the power goes off , but the 2,000 some employees wouldn ’ t have to worry about lost work .
within seconds the building ’ s own power unit springs to life and produces enough electricity for the 300-meter high building , the computer systems and all the work spaces .
the elevators would continue to run and the automatic windows would open – nothing like what happened on thursday on wall street would be occur here .
even frankfurt international airport would be difficult to shut down .
a lot would have to happen before the lights go off and all flights are grounded , says fraport spokesman jürgen harrer .
although he didn ’ t want to rule it out completely , he told reporters that it was " highly unlikely " the rhein-main airport would fail to function and be forced to close as was the case with three airports in new york .
two independent energy providers keep each other in check and ensure that the airport is continuously powered .
if , however , both should break down , the airport ’ s own 57 diesel-powered generators would take over the energy production .
these could supply enough electricity to power everything from the lighting on the runway to the escalators in the terminals .
and germany ’ s largest energy consumer , the deutsche bahn railway , is undaunted by the events in the united states .
the company believes a complete outage on its rail lines is " impossible . "
because the db runs its own power plants and feeds in electricity from several different independent energy consortiums , it would take quite a bit to bring the trains to a halt .
" in an extreme case we could even get electricity from our european neighbors , " company spokesman petra dowdall told spiegel online .
prevention and overproduction are keys the director of the energy consortium energie baden württemberg , utz claassen , attributes germany ’ s stabile energy supply to its focus on prevention and technology .
" germany is the worldwide leader " here , he told ard television .
germany ’ s electricity networks are also considerably closer-knit than in the united states .
there are fewer providers feeding from several different power plants within a regional network , and they are all integrated into the larger european energy network which stretches from norway to sicily .
european power plants always work with a considerable margin of overproduction , unlike in the united states where intense competition has forced providers to be stingy on production , pumping out just what the demand requires , says germany ’ s energy expert klaus traube .
as a whole europe could easily accommodate a loss of 3,000 megawatts of electricity at one time .
wulf bernotat , director of e.on , germany ’ s largest energy provider , is convinced that " whenever and wherever there is a power outage , an alternative plant will immediately kick in and start producing the extra amount required . "
if necessary , the plant can draw on electricity from a distant source outside the country , he was quoted as saying in spiegel magazine .
in order to continue to maintain a stabile energy flow in the future , germany must invest in its electrical lines , says istván erlich , professor for electrical-technology and networks at the university of duisburg .
in an interview with ard , he worries that although germany currently has a tightly regulated energy network and functioning power lines , the transit paths will naturally increase with their integration in the european network .
it will take longer for electricity to flow from the source to demand points and these paths are more susceptible to interruptions .
as a whole , europe also needs to increase the number of power plants it has and its surplus capacity .

to listen to the many voices , it appears to be the music industry ’ s holy grail ; a quest beset with perils and insurmountable odds with a glowing prize at the end .
how do you stop internet piracy and save your business ? in reality , it ’ s more like the search for the goose which lays the golden eggs .
stopping internet piracy is indeed a goal and saving the music industry a much desired by-product but , as highlighted by the discussion panel at cologne ’ s popkomm , the ultimate reward will be getting those who have been downloading music for free to become customers and start paying for the privilege .
the title of the panel gave it away : kazaa ’ s kids as customers .
it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .
declining sales due to the ‘ free lunch ’ phenomena so frequently mentioned would of course turn around if bootleggers were stopped , but with new technology finding new ways to access music , the determined hordes would soon create alternative avenues .
to kill two birds with one stone – severely dent the power of the pirates and return the industry to profitability – the record labels must embrace the generation that threatens them and give it what it wants .
instead of a prolonged and ultimately losing war , the music industry must face up to the fact that it ’ s more a case of ‘ if you can ’ t beat them , join them … but make them pay for it . ’
twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .
" we can solve the problem by making a better service .
it has to be easy – a one stop shop .
and if you charge a monthly subscription fee of € 10 a month for such a service , that ’ s good value .
but it has to be better , faster and easier than the illegal option to work . "
providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .
" providers such as aol and t-online should co-operate with only trustworthy partners and not allow their services to be hijacked by the pirates , " he said .
" by blocking certain addresses and preventing users from reaching these sites , we could provide a virtual shopping mall where only legal sharing takes place . "
challenged by moderator tobias kniebe on the subject of censorship on the internet , schäfer explained , " the internet will remain unaffected .
it would just be a contract between two businesses – the internet provider and the legal sharing portal .
this would create a security wall within the internet .
why should a company want their product out there in the illegal domain ?
an agreement between trustworthy partners would force those who want illegal music to change internet providers , someone less reputable … they aren ’ t going to do that . "
a generation without conscience professor karl-heinz brandenburg , a pioneer in mp3 technology with the fraunhofer group for electronic and media technology , agrees that the internet itself must be controlled as one part of the on-going struggle and that , in principle , improved legal services would tempt users away from bootlegging but believes that the ethical questions must also be addressed .
" we are dealing with a generation of kids with no conscience , who don ’ t believe they are doing anything wrong .
there is a huge question of legality here .
there should be clear definitions about what is unacceptable and it should be clear to people that if they do these things , they will be punished . "
brandenburg added that there are so many gray areas within the music industry , about what is acceptable and what is not , that such confusion is allowing some offenders to claim ignorance .
he called on a uniform agreement to define the boundaries of legality so there could be no excuses in the future .
from there , he said , improved security and service could combine to move the industry closer to controlling internet piracy and closer to turning kazaa ’ s kids into customers . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

a generation without conscience professor karl-heinz brandenburg , a pioneer in mp3 technology with the fraunhofer group for electronic and media technology , agrees that the internet itself must be controlled as one part of the on-going struggle and that , in principle , improved legal services would tempt users away from bootlegging but believes that the ethical questions must also be addressed .

to listen to the many voices , it appears to be the music industry ’ s holy grail ; a quest beset with perils and insurmountable odds with a glowing prize at the end .
how do you stop internet piracy and save your business ? in reality , it ’ s more like the search for the goose which lays the golden eggs .
stopping internet piracy is indeed a goal and saving the music industry a much desired by-product but , as highlighted by the discussion panel at cologne ’ s popkomm , the ultimate reward will be getting those who have been downloading music for free to become customers and start paying for the privilege .
the title of the panel gave it away : kazaa ’ s kids as customers .
it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .
declining sales due to the ‘ free lunch ’ phenomena so frequently mentioned would of course turn around if bootleggers were stopped , but with new technology finding new ways to access music , the determined hordes would soon create alternative avenues .
to kill two birds with one stone – severely dent the power of the pirates and return the industry to profitability – the record labels must embrace the generation that threatens them and give it what it wants .
instead of a prolonged and ultimately losing war , the music industry must face up to the fact that it ’ s more a case of ‘ if you can ’ t beat them , join them … but make them pay for it . ’
twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .
" we can solve the problem by making a better service .
it has to be easy – a one stop shop .
and if you charge a monthly subscription fee of € 10 a month for such a service , that ’ s good value .
but it has to be better , faster and easier than the illegal option to work . "
providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .
" providers such as aol and t-online should co-operate with only trustworthy partners and not allow their services to be hijacked by the pirates , " he said .
" by blocking certain addresses and preventing users from reaching these sites , we could provide a virtual shopping mall where only legal sharing takes place . "
challenged by moderator tobias kniebe on the subject of censorship on the internet , schäfer explained , " the internet will remain unaffected .
it would just be a contract between two businesses – the internet provider and the legal sharing portal .
this would create a security wall within the internet .

to listen to the many voices , it appears to be the music industry ’ s holy grail ; a quest beset with perils and insurmountable odds with a glowing prize at the end .
how do you stop internet piracy and save your business ? in reality , it ’ s more like the search for the goose which lays the golden eggs .
stopping internet piracy is indeed a goal and saving the music industry a much desired by-product but , as highlighted by the discussion panel at cologne ’ s popkomm , the ultimate reward will be getting those who have been downloading music for free to become customers and start paying for the privilege .
the title of the panel gave it away : kazaa ’ s kids as customers .
it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .
declining sales due to the ‘ free lunch ’ phenomena so frequently mentioned would of course turn around if bootleggers were stopped , but with new technology finding new ways to access music , the determined hordes would soon create alternative avenues .
to kill two birds with one stone – severely dent the power of the pirates and return the industry to profitability – the record labels must embrace the generation that threatens them and give it what it wants .
instead of a prolonged and ultimately losing war , the music industry must face up to the fact that it ’ s more a case of ‘ if you can ’ t beat them , join them … but make them pay for it . ’
twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .
" we can solve the problem by making a better service .
it has to be easy – a one stop shop .
and if you charge a monthly subscription fee of € 10 a month for such a service , that ’ s good value .
but it has to be better , faster and easier than the illegal option to work . "
providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .
" providers such as aol and t-online should co-operate with only trustworthy partners and not allow their services to be hijacked by the pirates , " he said .
" by blocking certain addresses and preventing users from reaching these sites , we could provide a virtual shopping mall where only legal sharing takes place . "
challenged by moderator tobias kniebe on the subject of censorship on the internet , schäfer explained , " the internet will remain unaffected .
it would just be a contract between two businesses – the internet provider and the legal sharing portal .
this would create a security wall within the internet .
why should a company want their product out there in the illegal domain ?
an agreement between trustworthy partners would force those who want illegal music to change internet providers , someone less reputable … they aren ’ t going to do that . "
a generation without conscience professor karl-heinz brandenburg , a pioneer in mp3 technology with the fraunhofer group for electronic and media technology , agrees that the internet itself must be controlled as one part of the on-going struggle and that , in principle , improved legal services would tempt users away from bootlegging but believes that the ethical questions must also be addressed .
" we are dealing with a generation of kids with no conscience , who don ’ t believe they are doing anything wrong .
there is a huge question of legality here .
there should be clear definitions about what is unacceptable and it should be clear to people that if they do these things , they will be punished . "
brandenburg added that there are so many gray areas within the music industry , about what is acceptable and what is not , that such confusion is allowing some offenders to claim ignorance .
he called on a uniform agreement to define the boundaries of legality so there could be no excuses in the future .
from there , he said , improved security and service could combine to move the industry closer to controlling internet piracy and closer to turning kazaa ’ s kids into customers . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.08.2003 complete blackout unlikely in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's focus on prevention and surplus energy production ensures not all the lights will go off .
crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function . it ’ s an abbreviation that saves lives - usv , uninterrupted electricity flow - and it belongs to the standard equipment in every german hospital .
in the event of a total power outage as in the northeastern united states and canada , usv would immediately spring to life , pumping electricity to all the hospital ’ s intensive care machines with juice from a giant battery , but just for a brief moment .
only 15 seconds after a shutdown in the electricity network , the hospital ’ s own emergency power unit kicks into action .
a diesel motor and a generator form a mini power plant and take over the complete electricity production .
in this way an entire hospital complex can function for an extended period without relying on the public energy supply .
a giant three-day-tank holds enough diesel to carry the power unit through an initial emergency period , and every hospital is required to keep a reserve of diesel for at least 24 hours .
every month technicians conduct an hour-long test on the emergency power units , to check for maintenance problems and breaks in the circuitry .
all of this is required by law .
and most other institutions integral to the smooth functioning of german society , such as large banks , the deutsche bahn rail system and the airports , are also outfitted with such equipment .
experts say germany could quickly respond to a widespread blackout , although there has never been a real test of the system .
statistics , however , speak for themselves , they argue , and compared to other industrialized nations , germany has had the lowest number of minutes of electrical failure in the past year , just 15 .
keeping things running unlike in the hospitals , the business conducted in the commerzbank in frankfurt is not about life or death .
but the situation could nevertheless become pretty dramatic for the people working in europe ’ s largest office building .
that ’ s why a special emergency power unit was installed for the unlikely event of a complete blackout .
at the most a couple hundred computers would shut down when the power goes off , but the 2,000 some employees wouldn ’ t have to worry about lost work .
within seconds the building ’ s own power unit springs to life and produces enough electricity for the 300-meter high building , the computer systems and all the work spaces .
the elevators would continue to run and the automatic windows would open – nothing like what happened on thursday on wall street would be occur here .
even frankfurt international airport would be difficult to shut down .
a lot would have to happen before the lights go off and all flights are grounded , says fraport spokesman jürgen harrer .
although he didn ’ t want to rule it out completely , he told reporters that it was " highly unlikely " the rhein-main airport would fail to function and be forced to close as was the case with three airports in new york .
two independent energy providers keep each other in check and ensure that the airport is continuously powered .
if , however , both should break down , the airport ’ s own 57 diesel-powered generators would take over the energy production .
these could supply enough electricity to power everything from the lighting on the runway to the escalators in the terminals .
and germany ’ s largest energy consumer , the deutsche bahn railway , is undaunted by the events in the united states .
the company believes a complete outage on its rail lines is " impossible . "
because the db runs its own power plants and feeds in electricity from several different independent energy consortiums , it would take quite a bit to bring the trains to a halt .
" in an extreme case we could even get electricity from our european neighbors , " company spokesman petra dowdall told spiegel online .
prevention and overproduction are keys the director of the energy consortium energie baden württemberg , utz claassen , attributes germany ’ s stabile energy supply to its focus on prevention and technology .
" germany is the worldwide leader " here , he told ard television .
germany ’ s electricity networks are also considerably closer-knit than in the united states .
there are fewer providers feeding from several different power plants within a regional network , and they are all integrated into the larger european energy network which stretches from norway to sicily .
european power plants always work with a considerable margin of overproduction , unlike in the united states where intense competition has forced providers to be stingy on production , pumping out just what the demand requires , says germany ’ s energy expert klaus traube .
as a whole europe could easily accommodate a loss of 3,000 megawatts of electricity at one time .
wulf bernotat , director of e.on , germany ’ s largest energy provider , is convinced that " whenever and wherever there is a power outage , an alternative plant will immediately kick in and start producing the extra amount required . "
if necessary , the plant can draw on electricity from a distant source outside the country , he was quoted as saying in spiegel magazine .
in order to continue to maintain a stabile energy flow in the future , germany must invest in its electrical lines , says istván erlich , professor for electrical-technology and networks at the university of duisburg .
in an interview with ard , he worries that although germany currently has a tightly regulated energy network and functioning power lines , the transit paths will naturally increase with their integration in the european network .
it will take longer for electricity to flow from the source to demand points and these paths are more susceptible to interruptions .
as a whole , europe also needs to increase the number of power plants it has and its surplus capacity .

twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .
" we can solve the problem by making a better service .
it has to be easy – a one stop shop .
and if you charge a monthly subscription fee of € 10 a month for such a service , that ’ s good value .
but it has to be better , faster and easier than the illegal option to work . "
providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .
" providers such as aol and t-online should co-operate with only trustworthy partners and not allow their services to be hijacked by the pirates , " he said .
" by blocking certain addresses and preventing users from reaching these sites , we could provide a virtual shopping mall where only legal sharing takes place . "
challenged by moderator tobias kniebe on the subject of censorship on the internet , schäfer explained , " the internet will remain unaffected .
it would just be a contract between two businesses – the internet provider and the legal sharing portal .
this would create a security wall within the internet .
why should a company want their product out there in the illegal domain ?
an agreement between trustworthy partners would force those who want illegal music to change internet providers , someone less reputable … they aren ’ t going to do that . "
a generation without conscience professor karl-heinz brandenburg , a pioneer in mp3 technology with the fraunhofer group for electronic and media technology , agrees that the internet itself must be controlled as one part of the on-going struggle and that , in principle , improved legal services would tempt users away from bootlegging but believes that the ethical questions must also be addressed .
" we are dealing with a generation of kids with no conscience , who don ’ t believe they are doing anything wrong .
there is a huge question of legality here .
there should be clear definitions about what is unacceptable and it should be clear to people that if they do these things , they will be punished . "
brandenburg added that there are so many gray areas within the music industry , about what is acceptable and what is not , that such confusion is allowing some offenders to claim ignorance .
he called on a uniform agreement to define the boundaries of legality so there could be no excuses in the future .
from there , he said , improved security and service could combine to move the industry closer to controlling internet piracy and closer to turning kazaa ’ s kids into customers . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function . it ’ s an abbreviation that saves lives - usv , uninterrupted electricity flow - and it belongs to the standard equipment in every german hospital .
in the event of a total power outage as in the northeastern united states and canada , usv would immediately spring to life , pumping electricity to all the hospital ’ s intensive care machines with juice from a giant battery , but just for a brief moment .
only 15 seconds after a shutdown in the electricity network , the hospital ’ s own emergency power unit kicks into action .
a diesel motor and a generator form a mini power plant and take over the complete electricity production .
in this way an entire hospital complex can function for an extended period without relying on the public energy supply .
a giant three-day-tank holds enough diesel to carry the power unit through an initial emergency period , and every hospital is required to keep a reserve of diesel for at least 24 hours .
every month technicians conduct an hour-long test on the emergency power units , to check for maintenance problems and breaks in the circuitry .
all of this is required by law .
and most other institutions integral to the smooth functioning of german society , such as large banks , the deutsche bahn rail system and the airports , are also outfitted with such equipment .
experts say germany could quickly respond to a widespread blackout , although there has never been a real test of the system .
statistics , however , speak for themselves , they argue , and compared to other industrialized nations , germany has had the lowest number of minutes of electrical failure in the past year , just 15 .
keeping things running unlike in the hospitals , the business conducted in the commerzbank in frankfurt is not about life or death .
but the situation could nevertheless become pretty dramatic for the people working in europe ’ s largest office building .
that ’ s why a special emergency power unit was installed for the unlikely event of a complete blackout .
at the most a couple hundred computers would shut down when the power goes off , but the 2,000 some employees wouldn ’ t have to worry about lost work .
within seconds the building ’ s own power unit springs to life and produces enough electricity for the 300-meter high building , the computer systems and all the work spaces .
the elevators would continue to run and the automatic windows would open – nothing like what happened on thursday on wall street would be occur here .
even frankfurt international airport would be difficult to shut down .
a lot would have to happen before the lights go off and all flights are grounded , says fraport spokesman jürgen harrer .
although he didn ’ t want to rule it out completely , he told reporters that it was " highly unlikely " the rhein-main airport would fail to function and be forced to close as was the case with three airports in new york .
two independent energy providers keep each other in check and ensure that the airport is continuously powered .
if , however , both should break down , the airport ’ s own 57 diesel-powered generators would take over the energy production .
these could supply enough electricity to power everything from the lighting on the runway to the escalators in the terminals .
and germany ’ s largest energy consumer , the deutsche bahn railway , is undaunted by the events in the united states .
the company believes a complete outage on its rail lines is " impossible . "
because the db runs its own power plants and feeds in electricity from several different independent energy consortiums , it would take quite a bit to bring the trains to a halt .
" in an extreme case we could even get electricity from our european neighbors , " company spokesman petra dowdall told spiegel online .
prevention and overproduction are keys the director of the energy consortium energie baden württemberg , utz claassen , attributes germany ’ s stabile energy supply to its focus on prevention and technology .
" germany is the worldwide leader " here , he told ard television .
germany ’ s electricity networks are also considerably closer-knit than in the united states .
there are fewer providers feeding from several different power plants within a regional network , and they are all integrated into the larger european energy network which stretches from norway to sicily .
european power plants always work with a considerable margin of overproduction , unlike in the united states where intense competition has forced providers to be stingy on production , pumping out just what the demand requires , says germany ’ s energy expert klaus traube .
as a whole europe could easily accommodate a loss of 3,000 megawatts of electricity at one time .
wulf bernotat , director of e.on , germany ’ s largest energy provider , is convinced that " whenever and wherever there is a power outage , an alternative plant will immediately kick in and start producing the extra amount required . "
if necessary , the plant can draw on electricity from a distant source outside the country , he was quoted as saying in spiegel magazine .
in order to continue to maintain a stabile energy flow in the future , germany must invest in its electrical lines , says istván erlich , professor for electrical-technology and networks at the university of duisburg .
in an interview with ard , he worries that although germany currently has a tightly regulated energy network and functioning power lines , the transit paths will naturally increase with their integration in the european network .
it will take longer for electricity to flow from the source to demand points and these paths are more susceptible to interruptions .
as a whole , europe also needs to increase the number of power plants it has and its surplus capacity .
if this doesn ’ t happen , then a power outage could be the result , albeit not to the extent of the current u.s. blackout . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping the lights on in germany large-scale power outages in the united states and canada have germans wondering if the same could happen to them , especially after a week of heat-wave related energy problems -lrb- aug .
15 , 2003 -rrb- .
what will power germany in the future ?
as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary .

it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .

wulf bernotat , director of e.on , germany ’ s largest energy provider , is convinced that " whenever and wherever there is a power outage , an alternative plant will immediately kick in and start producing the extra amount required . "
if necessary , the plant can draw on electricity from a distant source outside the country , he was quoted as saying in spiegel magazine .
in order to continue to maintain a stabile energy flow in the future , germany must invest in its electrical lines , says istván erlich , professor for electrical-technology and networks at the university of duisburg .
in an interview with ard , he worries that although germany currently has a tightly regulated energy network and functioning power lines , the transit paths will naturally increase with their integration in the european network .
it will take longer for electricity to flow from the source to demand points and these paths are more susceptible to interruptions .
as a whole , europe also needs to increase the number of power plants it has and its surplus capacity .

crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function . it ’ s an abbreviation that saves lives - usv , uninterrupted electricity flow - and it belongs to the standard equipment in every german hospital .
in the event of a total power outage as in the northeastern united states and canada , usv would immediately spring to life , pumping electricity to all the hospital ’ s intensive care machines with juice from a giant battery , but just for a brief moment .
only 15 seconds after a shutdown in the electricity network , the hospital ’ s own emergency power unit kicks into action .
a diesel motor and a generator form a mini power plant and take over the complete electricity production .
in this way an entire hospital complex can function for an extended period without relying on the public energy supply .
a giant three-day-tank holds enough diesel to carry the power unit through an initial emergency period , and every hospital is required to keep a reserve of diesel for at least 24 hours .
every month technicians conduct an hour-long test on the emergency power units , to check for maintenance problems and breaks in the circuitry .
all of this is required by law .
and most other institutions integral to the smooth functioning of german society , such as large banks , the deutsche bahn rail system and the airports , are also outfitted with such equipment .
experts say germany could quickly respond to a widespread blackout , although there has never been a real test of the system .
statistics , however , speak for themselves , they argue , and compared to other industrialized nations , germany has had the lowest number of minutes of electrical failure in the past year , just 15 .
keeping things running unlike in the hospitals , the business conducted in the commerzbank in frankfurt is not about life or death .
but the situation could nevertheless become pretty dramatic for the people working in europe ’ s largest office building .
that ’ s why a special emergency power unit was installed for the unlikely event of a complete blackout .
at the most a couple hundred computers would shut down when the power goes off , but the 2,000 some employees wouldn ’ t have to worry about lost work .
within seconds the building ’ s own power unit springs to life and produces enough electricity for the 300-meter high building , the computer systems and all the work spaces .
the elevators would continue to run and the automatic windows would open – nothing like what happened on thursday on wall street would be occur here .
even frankfurt international airport would be difficult to shut down .
a lot would have to happen before the lights go off and all flights are grounded , says fraport spokesman jürgen harrer .
although he didn ’ t want to rule it out completely , he told reporters that it was " highly unlikely " the rhein-main airport would fail to function and be forced to close as was the case with three airports in new york .
two independent energy providers keep each other in check and ensure that the airport is continuously powered .
if , however , both should break down , the airport ’ s own 57 diesel-powered generators would take over the energy production .
these could supply enough electricity to power everything from the lighting on the runway to the escalators in the terminals .
and germany ’ s largest energy consumer , the deutsche bahn railway , is undaunted by the events in the united states .
the company believes a complete outage on its rail lines is " impossible . "
because the db runs its own power plants and feeds in electricity from several different independent energy consortiums , it would take quite a bit to bring the trains to a halt .
" in an extreme case we could even get electricity from our european neighbors , " company spokesman petra dowdall told spiegel online .
prevention and overproduction are keys the director of the energy consortium energie baden württemberg , utz claassen , attributes germany ’ s stabile energy supply to its focus on prevention and technology .
" germany is the worldwide leader " here , he told ard television .
germany ’ s electricity networks are also considerably closer-knit than in the united states .
there are fewer providers feeding from several different power plants within a regional network , and they are all integrated into the larger european energy network which stretches from norway to sicily .
european power plants always work with a considerable margin of overproduction , unlike in the united states where intense competition has forced providers to be stingy on production , pumping out just what the demand requires , says germany ’ s energy expert klaus traube .
as a whole europe could easily accommodate a loss of 3,000 megawatts of electricity at one time .

to listen to the many voices , it appears to be the music industry ’ s holy grail ; a quest beset with perils and insurmountable odds with a glowing prize at the end .
how do you stop internet piracy and save your business ? in reality , it ’ s more like the search for the goose which lays the golden eggs .
stopping internet piracy is indeed a goal and saving the music industry a much desired by-product but , as highlighted by the discussion panel at cologne ’ s popkomm , the ultimate reward will be getting those who have been downloading music for free to become customers and start paying for the privilege .
the title of the panel gave it away : kazaa ’ s kids as customers .
it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .
declining sales due to the ‘ free lunch ’ phenomena so frequently mentioned would of course turn around if bootleggers were stopped , but with new technology finding new ways to access music , the determined hordes would soon create alternative avenues .
to kill two birds with one stone – severely dent the power of the pirates and return the industry to profitability – the record labels must embrace the generation that threatens them and give it what it wants .
instead of a prolonged and ultimately losing war , the music industry must face up to the fact that it ’ s more a case of ‘ if you can ’ t beat them , join them … but make them pay for it . ’
twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .
" we can solve the problem by making a better service .
it has to be easy – a one stop shop .
and if you charge a monthly subscription fee of € 10 a month for such a service , that ’ s good value .
but it has to be better , faster and easier than the illegal option to work . "
providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .
" providers such as aol and t-online should co-operate with only trustworthy partners and not allow their services to be hijacked by the pirates , " he said .
" by blocking certain addresses and preventing users from reaching these sites , we could provide a virtual shopping mall where only legal sharing takes place . "
challenged by moderator tobias kniebe on the subject of censorship on the internet , schäfer explained , " the internet will remain unaffected .
it would just be a contract between two businesses – the internet provider and the legal sharing portal .
this would create a security wall within the internet .
why should a company want their product out there in the illegal domain ?
an agreement between trustworthy partners would force those who want illegal music to change internet providers , someone less reputable … they aren ’ t going to do that . "
a generation without conscience professor karl-heinz brandenburg , a pioneer in mp3 technology with the fraunhofer group for electronic and media technology , agrees that the internet itself must be controlled as one part of the on-going struggle and that , in principle , improved legal services would tempt users away from bootlegging but believes that the ethical questions must also be addressed .
" we are dealing with a generation of kids with no conscience , who don ’ t believe they are doing anything wrong .
there is a huge question of legality here .
there should be clear definitions about what is unacceptable and it should be clear to people that if they do these things , they will be punished . "
brandenburg added that there are so many gray areas within the music industry , about what is acceptable and what is not , that such confusion is allowing some offenders to claim ignorance .
he called on a uniform agreement to define the boundaries of legality so there could be no excuses in the future .
from there , he said , improved security and service could combine to move the industry closer to controlling internet piracy and closer to turning kazaa ’ s kids into customers . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

to listen to the many voices , it appears to be the music industry ’ s holy grail ; a quest beset with perils and insurmountable odds with a glowing prize at the end .
how do you stop internet piracy and save your business ? in reality , it ’ s more like the search for the goose which lays the golden eggs .
stopping internet piracy is indeed a goal and saving the music industry a much desired by-product but , as highlighted by the discussion panel at cologne ’ s popkomm , the ultimate reward will be getting those who have been downloading music for free to become customers and start paying for the privilege .

it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .
declining sales due to the ‘ free lunch ’ phenomena so frequently mentioned would of course turn around if bootleggers were stopped , but with new technology finding new ways to access music , the determined hordes would soon create alternative avenues .
to kill two birds with one stone – severely dent the power of the pirates and return the industry to profitability – the record labels must embrace the generation that threatens them and give it what it wants .
instead of a prolonged and ultimately losing war , the music industry must face up to the fact that it ’ s more a case of ‘ if you can ’ t beat them , join them … but make them pay for it . ’
twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .

providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de current affairs -pipe- 16.08.2003 complete blackout unlikely in germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's focus on prevention and surplus energy production ensures not all the lights will go off .
crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function . it ’ s an abbreviation that saves lives - usv , uninterrupted electricity flow - and it belongs to the standard equipment in every german hospital .
in the event of a total power outage as in the northeastern united states and canada , usv would immediately spring to life , pumping electricity to all the hospital ’ s intensive care machines with juice from a giant battery , but just for a brief moment .
only 15 seconds after a shutdown in the electricity network , the hospital ’ s own emergency power unit kicks into action .
a diesel motor and a generator form a mini power plant and take over the complete electricity production .
in this way an entire hospital complex can function for an extended period without relying on the public energy supply .
a giant three-day-tank holds enough diesel to carry the power unit through an initial emergency period , and every hospital is required to keep a reserve of diesel for at least 24 hours .
every month technicians conduct an hour-long test on the emergency power units , to check for maintenance problems and breaks in the circuitry .
all of this is required by law .
and most other institutions integral to the smooth functioning of german society , such as large banks , the deutsche bahn rail system and the airports , are also outfitted with such equipment .
experts say germany could quickly respond to a widespread blackout , although there has never been a real test of the system .
statistics , however , speak for themselves , they argue , and compared to other industrialized nations , germany has had the lowest number of minutes of electrical failure in the past year , just 15 .
keeping things running unlike in the hospitals , the business conducted in the commerzbank in frankfurt is not about life or death .
but the situation could nevertheless become pretty dramatic for the people working in europe ’ s largest office building .
that ’ s why a special emergency power unit was installed for the unlikely event of a complete blackout .
at the most a couple hundred computers would shut down when the power goes off , but the 2,000 some employees wouldn ’ t have to worry about lost work .
within seconds the building ’ s own power unit springs to life and produces enough electricity for the 300-meter high building , the computer systems and all the work spaces .
the elevators would continue to run and the automatic windows would open – nothing like what happened on thursday on wall street would be occur here .
even frankfurt international airport would be difficult to shut down .
a lot would have to happen before the lights go off and all flights are grounded , says fraport spokesman jürgen harrer .
although he didn ’ t want to rule it out completely , he told reporters that it was " highly unlikely " the rhein-main airport would fail to function and be forced to close as was the case with three airports in new york .
two independent energy providers keep each other in check and ensure that the airport is continuously powered .
if , however , both should break down , the airport ’ s own 57 diesel-powered generators would take over the energy production .
these could supply enough electricity to power everything from the lighting on the runway to the escalators in the terminals .
and germany ’ s largest energy consumer , the deutsche bahn railway , is undaunted by the events in the united states .
the company believes a complete outage on its rail lines is " impossible . "
because the db runs its own power plants and feeds in electricity from several different independent energy consortiums , it would take quite a bit to bring the trains to a halt .
" in an extreme case we could even get electricity from our european neighbors , " company spokesman petra dowdall told spiegel online .
prevention and overproduction are keys the director of the energy consortium energie baden württemberg , utz claassen , attributes germany ’ s stabile energy supply to its focus on prevention and technology .
" germany is the worldwide leader " here , he told ard television .
germany ’ s electricity networks are also considerably closer-knit than in the united states .
there are fewer providers feeding from several different power plants within a regional network , and they are all integrated into the larger european energy network which stretches from norway to sicily .
european power plants always work with a considerable margin of overproduction , unlike in the united states where intense competition has forced providers to be stingy on production , pumping out just what the demand requires , says germany ’ s energy expert klaus traube .
as a whole europe could easily accommodate a loss of 3,000 megawatts of electricity at one time .
wulf bernotat , director of e.on , germany ’ s largest energy provider , is convinced that " whenever and wherever there is a power outage , an alternative plant will immediately kick in and start producing the extra amount required . "
if necessary , the plant can draw on electricity from a distant source outside the country , he was quoted as saying in spiegel magazine .
in order to continue to maintain a stabile energy flow in the future , germany must invest in its electrical lines , says istván erlich , professor for electrical-technology and networks at the university of duisburg .
in an interview with ard , he worries that although germany currently has a tightly regulated energy network and functioning power lines , the transit paths will naturally increase with their integration in the european network .
it will take longer for electricity to flow from the source to demand points and these paths are more susceptible to interruptions .
as a whole , europe also needs to increase the number of power plants it has and its surplus capacity .
if this doesn ’ t happen , then a power outage could be the result , albeit not to the extent of the current u.s. blackout . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping the lights on in germany large-scale power outages in the united states and canada have germans wondering if the same could happen to them , especially after a week of heat-wave related energy problems -lrb- aug .

to listen to the many voices , it appears to be the music industry ’ s holy grail ; a quest beset with perils and insurmountable odds with a glowing prize at the end .
how do you stop internet piracy and save your business ? in reality , it ’ s more like the search for the goose which lays the golden eggs .
stopping internet piracy is indeed a goal and saving the music industry a much desired by-product but , as highlighted by the discussion panel at cologne ’ s popkomm , the ultimate reward will be getting those who have been downloading music for free to become customers and start paying for the privilege .
the title of the panel gave it away : kazaa ’ s kids as customers .
it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .
declining sales due to the ‘ free lunch ’ phenomena so frequently mentioned would of course turn around if bootleggers were stopped , but with new technology finding new ways to access music , the determined hordes would soon create alternative avenues .
to kill two birds with one stone – severely dent the power of the pirates and return the industry to profitability – the record labels must embrace the generation that threatens them and give it what it wants .
instead of a prolonged and ultimately losing war , the music industry must face up to the fact that it ’ s more a case of ‘ if you can ’ t beat them , join them … but make them pay for it . ’
twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .
" we can solve the problem by making a better service .
it has to be easy – a one stop shop .
and if you charge a monthly subscription fee of € 10 a month for such a service , that ’ s good value .
but it has to be better , faster and easier than the illegal option to work . "
providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .
" providers such as aol and t-online should co-operate with only trustworthy partners and not allow their services to be hijacked by the pirates , " he said .
" by blocking certain addresses and preventing users from reaching these sites , we could provide a virtual shopping mall where only legal sharing takes place . "
challenged by moderator tobias kniebe on the subject of censorship on the internet , schäfer explained , " the internet will remain unaffected .
it would just be a contract between two businesses – the internet provider and the legal sharing portal .
this would create a security wall within the internet .
why should a company want their product out there in the illegal domain ?
an agreement between trustworthy partners would force those who want illegal music to change internet providers , someone less reputable … they aren ’ t going to do that . "
a generation without conscience professor karl-heinz brandenburg , a pioneer in mp3 technology with the fraunhofer group for electronic and media technology , agrees that the internet itself must be controlled as one part of the on-going struggle and that , in principle , improved legal services would tempt users away from bootlegging but believes that the ethical questions must also be addressed .
" we are dealing with a generation of kids with no conscience , who don ’ t believe they are doing anything wrong .
there is a huge question of legality here .
there should be clear definitions about what is unacceptable and it should be clear to people that if they do these things , they will be punished . "
brandenburg added that there are so many gray areas within the music industry , about what is acceptable and what is not , that such confusion is allowing some offenders to claim ignorance .
he called on a uniform agreement to define the boundaries of legality so there could be no excuses in the future .
from there , he said , improved security and service could combine to move the industry closer to controlling internet piracy and closer to turning kazaa ’ s kids into customers . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

to listen to the many voices , it appears to be the music industry ’ s holy grail ; a quest beset with perils and insurmountable odds with a glowing prize at the end .
how do you stop internet piracy and save your business ? in reality , it ’ s more like the search for the goose which lays the golden eggs .
stopping internet piracy is indeed a goal and saving the music industry a much desired by-product but , as highlighted by the discussion panel at cologne ’ s popkomm , the ultimate reward will be getting those who have been downloading music for free to become customers and start paying for the privilege .
the title of the panel gave it away : kazaa ’ s kids as customers .
it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .
declining sales due to the ‘ free lunch ’ phenomena so frequently mentioned would of course turn around if bootleggers were stopped , but with new technology finding new ways to access music , the determined hordes would soon create alternative avenues .
to kill two birds with one stone – severely dent the power of the pirates and return the industry to profitability – the record labels must embrace the generation that threatens them and give it what it wants .
instead of a prolonged and ultimately losing war , the music industry must face up to the fact that it ’ s more a case of ‘ if you can ’ t beat them , join them … but make them pay for it . ’
twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .
" we can solve the problem by making a better service .
it has to be easy – a one stop shop .
and if you charge a monthly subscription fee of € 10 a month for such a service , that ’ s good value .
but it has to be better , faster and easier than the illegal option to work . "
providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .
" providers such as aol and t-online should co-operate with only trustworthy partners and not allow their services to be hijacked by the pirates , " he said .
" by blocking certain addresses and preventing users from reaching these sites , we could provide a virtual shopping mall where only legal sharing takes place . "
challenged by moderator tobias kniebe on the subject of censorship on the internet , schäfer explained , " the internet will remain unaffected .
it would just be a contract between two businesses – the internet provider and the legal sharing portal .
this would create a security wall within the internet .
why should a company want their product out there in the illegal domain ?
an agreement between trustworthy partners would force those who want illegal music to change internet providers , someone less reputable … they aren ’ t going to do that . "
a generation without conscience professor karl-heinz brandenburg , a pioneer in mp3 technology with the fraunhofer group for electronic and media technology , agrees that the internet itself must be controlled as one part of the on-going struggle and that , in principle , improved legal services would tempt users away from bootlegging but believes that the ethical questions must also be addressed .
" we are dealing with a generation of kids with no conscience , who don ’ t believe they are doing anything wrong .

crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function . it ’ s an abbreviation that saves lives - usv , uninterrupted electricity flow - and it belongs to the standard equipment in every german hospital .
in the event of a total power outage as in the northeastern united states and canada , usv would immediately spring to life , pumping electricity to all the hospital ’ s intensive care machines with juice from a giant battery , but just for a brief moment .
only 15 seconds after a shutdown in the electricity network , the hospital ’ s own emergency power unit kicks into action .
a diesel motor and a generator form a mini power plant and take over the complete electricity production .
in this way an entire hospital complex can function for an extended period without relying on the public energy supply .
a giant three-day-tank holds enough diesel to carry the power unit through an initial emergency period , and every hospital is required to keep a reserve of diesel for at least 24 hours .
every month technicians conduct an hour-long test on the emergency power units , to check for maintenance problems and breaks in the circuitry .
all of this is required by law .
and most other institutions integral to the smooth functioning of german society , such as large banks , the deutsche bahn rail system and the airports , are also outfitted with such equipment .
experts say germany could quickly respond to a widespread blackout , although there has never been a real test of the system .
statistics , however , speak for themselves , they argue , and compared to other industrialized nations , germany has had the lowest number of minutes of electrical failure in the past year , just 15 .
keeping things running unlike in the hospitals , the business conducted in the commerzbank in frankfurt is not about life or death .
but the situation could nevertheless become pretty dramatic for the people working in europe ’ s largest office building .
that ’ s why a special emergency power unit was installed for the unlikely event of a complete blackout .
at the most a couple hundred computers would shut down when the power goes off , but the 2,000 some employees wouldn ’ t have to worry about lost work .
within seconds the building ’ s own power unit springs to life and produces enough electricity for the 300-meter high building , the computer systems and all the work spaces .
the elevators would continue to run and the automatic windows would open – nothing like what happened on thursday on wall street would be occur here .
even frankfurt international airport would be difficult to shut down .
a lot would have to happen before the lights go off and all flights are grounded , says fraport spokesman jürgen harrer .
although he didn ’ t want to rule it out completely , he told reporters that it was " highly unlikely " the rhein-main airport would fail to function and be forced to close as was the case with three airports in new york .
two independent energy providers keep each other in check and ensure that the airport is continuously powered .
if , however , both should break down , the airport ’ s own 57 diesel-powered generators would take over the energy production .
these could supply enough electricity to power everything from the lighting on the runway to the escalators in the terminals .
and germany ’ s largest energy consumer , the deutsche bahn railway , is undaunted by the events in the united states .
the company believes a complete outage on its rail lines is " impossible . "
because the db runs its own power plants and feeds in electricity from several different independent energy consortiums , it would take quite a bit to bring the trains to a halt .
" in an extreme case we could even get electricity from our european neighbors , " company spokesman petra dowdall told spiegel online .
prevention and overproduction are keys the director of the energy consortium energie baden württemberg , utz claassen , attributes germany ’ s stabile energy supply to its focus on prevention and technology .
" germany is the worldwide leader " here , he told ard television .
germany ’ s electricity networks are also considerably closer-knit than in the united states .
there are fewer providers feeding from several different power plants within a regional network , and they are all integrated into the larger european energy network which stretches from norway to sicily .
european power plants always work with a considerable margin of overproduction , unlike in the united states where intense competition has forced providers to be stingy on production , pumping out just what the demand requires , says germany ’ s energy expert klaus traube .
as a whole europe could easily accommodate a loss of 3,000 megawatts of electricity at one time .
wulf bernotat , director of e.on , germany ’ s largest energy provider , is convinced that " whenever and wherever there is a power outage , an alternative plant will immediately kick in and start producing the extra amount required . "
if necessary , the plant can draw on electricity from a distant source outside the country , he was quoted as saying in spiegel magazine .
in order to continue to maintain a stabile energy flow in the future , germany must invest in its electrical lines , says istván erlich , professor for electrical-technology and networks at the university of duisburg .
in an interview with ard , he worries that although germany currently has a tightly regulated energy network and functioning power lines , the transit paths will naturally increase with their integration in the european network .
it will take longer for electricity to flow from the source to demand points and these paths are more susceptible to interruptions .
as a whole , europe also needs to increase the number of power plants it has and its surplus capacity .

crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function . it ’ s an abbreviation that saves lives - usv , uninterrupted electricity flow - and it belongs to the standard equipment in every german hospital .
in the event of a total power outage as in the northeastern united states and canada , usv would immediately spring to life , pumping electricity to all the hospital ’ s intensive care machines with juice from a giant battery , but just for a brief moment .
only 15 seconds after a shutdown in the electricity network , the hospital ’ s own emergency power unit kicks into action .
a diesel motor and a generator form a mini power plant and take over the complete electricity production .
in this way an entire hospital complex can function for an extended period without relying on the public energy supply .
a giant three-day-tank holds enough diesel to carry the power unit through an initial emergency period , and every hospital is required to keep a reserve of diesel for at least 24 hours .
every month technicians conduct an hour-long test on the emergency power units , to check for maintenance problems and breaks in the circuitry .
all of this is required by law .
and most other institutions integral to the smooth functioning of german society , such as large banks , the deutsche bahn rail system and the airports , are also outfitted with such equipment .
experts say germany could quickly respond to a widespread blackout , although there has never been a real test of the system .
statistics , however , speak for themselves , they argue , and compared to other industrialized nations , germany has had the lowest number of minutes of electrical failure in the past year , just 15 .
keeping things running unlike in the hospitals , the business conducted in the commerzbank in frankfurt is not about life or death .
but the situation could nevertheless become pretty dramatic for the people working in europe ’ s largest office building .
that ’ s why a special emergency power unit was installed for the unlikely event of a complete blackout .
at the most a couple hundred computers would shut down when the power goes off , but the 2,000 some employees wouldn ’ t have to worry about lost work .
within seconds the building ’ s own power unit springs to life and produces enough electricity for the 300-meter high building , the computer systems and all the work spaces .
the elevators would continue to run and the automatic windows would open – nothing like what happened on thursday on wall street would be occur here .
even frankfurt international airport would be difficult to shut down .
a lot would have to happen before the lights go off and all flights are grounded , says fraport spokesman jürgen harrer .
although he didn ’ t want to rule it out completely , he told reporters that it was " highly unlikely " the rhein-main airport would fail to function and be forced to close as was the case with three airports in new york .
two independent energy providers keep each other in check and ensure that the airport is continuously powered .
if , however , both should break down , the airport ’ s own 57 diesel-powered generators would take over the energy production .
these could supply enough electricity to power everything from the lighting on the runway to the escalators in the terminals .

there are fewer providers feeding from several different power plants within a regional network , and they are all integrated into the larger european energy network which stretches from norway to sicily .

in order to continue to maintain a stabile energy flow in the future , germany must invest in its electrical lines , says istván erlich , professor for electrical-technology and networks at the university of duisburg .
in an interview with ard , he worries that although germany currently has a tightly regulated energy network and functioning power lines , the transit paths will naturally increase with their integration in the european network .
it will take longer for electricity to flow from the source to demand points and these paths are more susceptible to interruptions .

to listen to the many voices , it appears to be the music industry ’ s holy grail ; a quest beset with perils and insurmountable odds with a glowing prize at the end .
how do you stop internet piracy and save your business ? in reality , it ’ s more like the search for the goose which lays the golden eggs .
stopping internet piracy is indeed a goal and saving the music industry a much desired by-product but , as highlighted by the discussion panel at cologne ’ s popkomm , the ultimate reward will be getting those who have been downloading music for free to become customers and start paying for the privilege .
the title of the panel gave it away : kazaa ’ s kids as customers .
it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .
declining sales due to the ‘ free lunch ’ phenomena so frequently mentioned would of course turn around if bootleggers were stopped , but with new technology finding new ways to access music , the determined hordes would soon create alternative avenues .
to kill two birds with one stone – severely dent the power of the pirates and return the industry to profitability – the record labels must embrace the generation that threatens them and give it what it wants .
instead of a prolonged and ultimately losing war , the music industry must face up to the fact that it ’ s more a case of ‘ if you can ’ t beat them , join them … but make them pay for it . ’
twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .
" we can solve the problem by making a better service .
it has to be easy – a one stop shop .
and if you charge a monthly subscription fee of € 10 a month for such a service , that ’ s good value .
but it has to be better , faster and easier than the illegal option to work . "
providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .
" providers such as aol and t-online should co-operate with only trustworthy partners and not allow their services to be hijacked by the pirates , " he said .
" by blocking certain addresses and preventing users from reaching these sites , we could provide a virtual shopping mall where only legal sharing takes place . "
challenged by moderator tobias kniebe on the subject of censorship on the internet , schäfer explained , " the internet will remain unaffected .
it would just be a contract between two businesses – the internet provider and the legal sharing portal .
this would create a security wall within the internet .
why should a company want their product out there in the illegal domain ?
an agreement between trustworthy partners would force those who want illegal music to change internet providers , someone less reputable … they aren ’ t going to do that . "
a generation without conscience professor karl-heinz brandenburg , a pioneer in mp3 technology with the fraunhofer group for electronic and media technology , agrees that the internet itself must be controlled as one part of the on-going struggle and that , in principle , improved legal services would tempt users away from bootlegging but believes that the ethical questions must also be addressed .
" we are dealing with a generation of kids with no conscience , who don ’ t believe they are doing anything wrong .
there is a huge question of legality here .
there should be clear definitions about what is unacceptable and it should be clear to people that if they do these things , they will be punished . "
brandenburg added that there are so many gray areas within the music industry , about what is acceptable and what is not , that such confusion is allowing some offenders to claim ignorance .
he called on a uniform agreement to define the boundaries of legality so there could be no excuses in the future .
from there , he said , improved security and service could combine to move the industry closer to controlling internet piracy and closer to turning kazaa ’ s kids into customers . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .

brandenburg added that there are so many gray areas within the music industry , about what is acceptable and what is not , that such confusion is allowing some offenders to claim ignorance .

crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function . it ’ s an abbreviation that saves lives - usv , uninterrupted electricity flow - and it belongs to the standard equipment in every german hospital .
in the event of a total power outage as in the northeastern united states and canada , usv would immediately spring to life , pumping electricity to all the hospital ’ s intensive care machines with juice from a giant battery , but just for a brief moment .
only 15 seconds after a shutdown in the electricity network , the hospital ’ s own emergency power unit kicks into action .
a diesel motor and a generator form a mini power plant and take over the complete electricity production .
in this way an entire hospital complex can function for an extended period without relying on the public energy supply .
a giant three-day-tank holds enough diesel to carry the power unit through an initial emergency period , and every hospital is required to keep a reserve of diesel for at least 24 hours .
every month technicians conduct an hour-long test on the emergency power units , to check for maintenance problems and breaks in the circuitry .
all of this is required by law .
and most other institutions integral to the smooth functioning of german society , such as large banks , the deutsche bahn rail system and the airports , are also outfitted with such equipment .
experts say germany could quickly respond to a widespread blackout , although there has never been a real test of the system .
statistics , however , speak for themselves , they argue , and compared to other industrialized nations , germany has had the lowest number of minutes of electrical failure in the past year , just 15 .
keeping things running unlike in the hospitals , the business conducted in the commerzbank in frankfurt is not about life or death .
but the situation could nevertheless become pretty dramatic for the people working in europe ’ s largest office building .
that ’ s why a special emergency power unit was installed for the unlikely event of a complete blackout .
at the most a couple hundred computers would shut down when the power goes off , but the 2,000 some employees wouldn ’ t have to worry about lost work .
within seconds the building ’ s own power unit springs to life and produces enough electricity for the 300-meter high building , the computer systems and all the work spaces .
the elevators would continue to run and the automatic windows would open – nothing like what happened on thursday on wall street would be occur here .
even frankfurt international airport would be difficult to shut down .
a lot would have to happen before the lights go off and all flights are grounded , says fraport spokesman jürgen harrer .
although he didn ’ t want to rule it out completely , he told reporters that it was " highly unlikely " the rhein-main airport would fail to function and be forced to close as was the case with three airports in new york .
two independent energy providers keep each other in check and ensure that the airport is continuously powered .
if , however , both should break down , the airport ’ s own 57 diesel-powered generators would take over the energy production .
these could supply enough electricity to power everything from the lighting on the runway to the escalators in the terminals .
and germany ’ s largest energy consumer , the deutsche bahn railway , is undaunted by the events in the united states .
the company believes a complete outage on its rail lines is " impossible . "
because the db runs its own power plants and feeds in electricity from several different independent energy consortiums , it would take quite a bit to bring the trains to a halt .
" in an extreme case we could even get electricity from our european neighbors , " company spokesman petra dowdall told spiegel online .
prevention and overproduction are keys the director of the energy consortium energie baden württemberg , utz claassen , attributes germany ’ s stabile energy supply to its focus on prevention and technology .
" germany is the worldwide leader " here , he told ard television .
germany ’ s electricity networks are also considerably closer-knit than in the united states .
there are fewer providers feeding from several different power plants within a regional network , and they are all integrated into the larger european energy network which stretches from norway to sicily .
european power plants always work with a considerable margin of overproduction , unlike in the united states where intense competition has forced providers to be stingy on production , pumping out just what the demand requires , says germany ’ s energy expert klaus traube .
as a whole europe could easily accommodate a loss of 3,000 megawatts of electricity at one time .
wulf bernotat , director of e.on , germany ’ s largest energy provider , is convinced that " whenever and wherever there is a power outage , an alternative plant will immediately kick in and start producing the extra amount required . "
if necessary , the plant can draw on electricity from a distant source outside the country , he was quoted as saying in spiegel magazine .
in order to continue to maintain a stabile energy flow in the future , germany must invest in its electrical lines , says istván erlich , professor for electrical-technology and networks at the university of duisburg .
in an interview with ard , he worries that although germany currently has a tightly regulated energy network and functioning power lines , the transit paths will naturally increase with their integration in the european network .
it will take longer for electricity to flow from the source to demand points and these paths are more susceptible to interruptions .
as a whole , europe also needs to increase the number of power plants it has and its surplus capacity .
if this doesn ’ t happen , then a power outage could be the result , albeit not to the extent of the current u.s. blackout . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de keeping the lights on in germany large-scale power outages in the united states and canada have germans wondering if the same could happen to them , especially after a week of heat-wave related energy problems -lrb- aug .
15 , 2003 -rrb- .
what will power germany in the future ?
as much of north america experienced its biggest ever blackout on thursday , chancellor schröder met with the bosses of europe 's largest energy concerns to discuss german power .
but the environmental minister is wary .

" we are dealing with a generation of kids with no conscience , who don ’ t believe they are doing anything wrong .
there is a huge question of legality here .
there should be clear definitions about what is unacceptable and it should be clear to people that if they do these things , they will be punished . "
brandenburg added that there are so many gray areas within the music industry , about what is acceptable and what is not , that such confusion is allowing some offenders to claim ignorance .
he called on a uniform agreement to define the boundaries of legality so there could be no excuses in the future .
from there , he said , improved security and service could combine to move the industry closer to controlling internet piracy and closer to turning kazaa ’ s kids into customers . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.08.2003 capturing kazaa 's kids as customers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kazaa 's free file sharing sounds great , but it 's illegal say music industry leaders .
to listen to the many voices , it appears to be the music industry ’ s holy grail ; a quest beset with perils and insurmountable odds with a glowing prize at the end .
how do you stop internet piracy and save your business ? in reality , it ’ s more like the search for the goose which lays the golden eggs .
stopping internet piracy is indeed a goal and saving the music industry a much desired by-product but , as highlighted by the discussion panel at cologne ’ s popkomm , the ultimate reward will be getting those who have been downloading music for free to become customers and start paying for the privilege .
the title of the panel gave it away : kazaa ’ s kids as customers .
it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .
declining sales due to the ‘ free lunch ’ phenomena so frequently mentioned would of course turn around if bootleggers were stopped , but with new technology finding new ways to access music , the determined hordes would soon create alternative avenues .
to kill two birds with one stone – severely dent the power of the pirates and return the industry to profitability – the record labels must embrace the generation that threatens them and give it what it wants .
instead of a prolonged and ultimately losing war , the music industry must face up to the fact that it ’ s more a case of ‘ if you can ’ t beat them , join them … but make them pay for it . ’
twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .
" we can solve the problem by making a better service .
it has to be easy – a one stop shop .
and if you charge a monthly subscription fee of € 10 a month for such a service , that ’ s good value .
but it has to be better , faster and easier than the illegal option to work . "
providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .
" providers such as aol and t-online should co-operate with only trustworthy partners and not allow their services to be hijacked by the pirates , " he said .
" by blocking certain addresses and preventing users from reaching these sites , we could provide a virtual shopping mall where only legal sharing takes place . "
challenged by moderator tobias kniebe on the subject of censorship on the internet , schäfer explained , " the internet will remain unaffected .
it would just be a contract between two businesses – the internet provider and the legal sharing portal .
this would create a security wall within the internet .
why should a company want their product out there in the illegal domain ?
an agreement between trustworthy partners would force those who want illegal music to change internet providers , someone less reputable … they aren ’ t going to do that . "
a generation without conscience professor karl-heinz brandenburg , a pioneer in mp3 technology with the fraunhofer group for electronic and media technology , agrees that the internet itself must be controlled as one part of the on-going struggle and that , in principle , improved legal services would tempt users away from bootlegging but believes that the ethical questions must also be addressed .
" we are dealing with a generation of kids with no conscience , who don ’ t believe they are doing anything wrong .
there is a huge question of legality here .
there should be clear definitions about what is unacceptable and it should be clear to people that if they do these things , they will be punished . "
brandenburg added that there are so many gray areas within the music industry , about what is acceptable and what is not , that such confusion is allowing some offenders to claim ignorance .
he called on a uniform agreement to define the boundaries of legality so there could be no excuses in the future .
from there , he said , improved security and service could combine to move the industry closer to controlling internet piracy and closer to turning kazaa ’ s kids into customers . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

to listen to the many voices , it appears to be the music industry ’ s holy grail ; a quest beset with perils and insurmountable odds with a glowing prize at the end .
how do you stop internet piracy and save your business ? in reality , it ’ s more like the search for the goose which lays the golden eggs .
stopping internet piracy is indeed a goal and saving the music industry a much desired by-product but , as highlighted by the discussion panel at cologne ’ s popkomm , the ultimate reward will be getting those who have been downloading music for free to become customers and start paying for the privilege .
the title of the panel gave it away : kazaa ’ s kids as customers .
it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .
declining sales due to the ‘ free lunch ’ phenomena so frequently mentioned would of course turn around if bootleggers were stopped , but with new technology finding new ways to access music , the determined hordes would soon create alternative avenues .
to kill two birds with one stone – severely dent the power of the pirates and return the industry to profitability – the record labels must embrace the generation that threatens them and give it what it wants .
instead of a prolonged and ultimately losing war , the music industry must face up to the fact that it ’ s more a case of ‘ if you can ’ t beat them , join them … but make them pay for it . ’
twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .
" we can solve the problem by making a better service .
it has to be easy – a one stop shop .
and if you charge a monthly subscription fee of € 10 a month for such a service , that ’ s good value .
but it has to be better , faster and easier than the illegal option to work . "
providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .
" providers such as aol and t-online should co-operate with only trustworthy partners and not allow their services to be hijacked by the pirates , " he said .
" by blocking certain addresses and preventing users from reaching these sites , we could provide a virtual shopping mall where only legal sharing takes place . "
challenged by moderator tobias kniebe on the subject of censorship on the internet , schäfer explained , " the internet will remain unaffected .
it would just be a contract between two businesses – the internet provider and the legal sharing portal .
this would create a security wall within the internet .
why should a company want their product out there in the illegal domain ?
an agreement between trustworthy partners would force those who want illegal music to change internet providers , someone less reputable … they aren ’ t going to do that . "
a generation without conscience professor karl-heinz brandenburg , a pioneer in mp3 technology with the fraunhofer group for electronic and media technology , agrees that the internet itself must be controlled as one part of the on-going struggle and that , in principle , improved legal services would tempt users away from bootlegging but believes that the ethical questions must also be addressed .
" we are dealing with a generation of kids with no conscience , who don ’ t believe they are doing anything wrong .
there is a huge question of legality here .
there should be clear definitions about what is unacceptable and it should be clear to people that if they do these things , they will be punished . "
brandenburg added that there are so many gray areas within the music industry , about what is acceptable and what is not , that such confusion is allowing some offenders to claim ignorance .
he called on a uniform agreement to define the boundaries of legality so there could be no excuses in the future .
from there , he said , improved security and service could combine to move the industry closer to controlling internet piracy and closer to turning kazaa ’ s kids into customers . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de idols , superstars , rock gods and ravers ...

crippled infrastructure , darkened hospitals , stalled elevators – is the chaos in the u.s. possible in germany ?
no , say experts , even in the event of power outages , the country would still function . it ’ s an abbreviation that saves lives - usv , uninterrupted electricity flow - and it belongs to the standard equipment in every german hospital .
in the event of a total power outage as in the northeastern united states and canada , usv would immediately spring to life , pumping electricity to all the hospital ’ s intensive care machines with juice from a giant battery , but just for a brief moment .
only 15 seconds after a shutdown in the electricity network , the hospital ’ s own emergency power unit kicks into action .
a diesel motor and a generator form a mini power plant and take over the complete electricity production .
in this way an entire hospital complex can function for an extended period without relying on the public energy supply .
a giant three-day-tank holds enough diesel to carry the power unit through an initial emergency period , and every hospital is required to keep a reserve of diesel for at least 24 hours .
every month technicians conduct an hour-long test on the emergency power units , to check for maintenance problems and breaks in the circuitry .
all of this is required by law .
and most other institutions integral to the smooth functioning of german society , such as large banks , the deutsche bahn rail system and the airports , are also outfitted with such equipment .
experts say germany could quickly respond to a widespread blackout , although there has never been a real test of the system .
statistics , however , speak for themselves , they argue , and compared to other industrialized nations , germany has had the lowest number of minutes of electrical failure in the past year , just 15 .
keeping things running unlike in the hospitals , the business conducted in the commerzbank in frankfurt is not about life or death .
but the situation could nevertheless become pretty dramatic for the people working in europe ’ s largest office building .
that ’ s why a special emergency power unit was installed for the unlikely event of a complete blackout .
at the most a couple hundred computers would shut down when the power goes off , but the 2,000 some employees wouldn ’ t have to worry about lost work .
within seconds the building ’ s own power unit springs to life and produces enough electricity for the 300-meter high building , the computer systems and all the work spaces .
the elevators would continue to run and the automatic windows would open – nothing like what happened on thursday on wall street would be occur here .
even frankfurt international airport would be difficult to shut down .
a lot would have to happen before the lights go off and all flights are grounded , says fraport spokesman jürgen harrer .
although he didn ’ t want to rule it out completely , he told reporters that it was " highly unlikely " the rhein-main airport would fail to function and be forced to close as was the case with three airports in new york .
two independent energy providers keep each other in check and ensure that the airport is continuously powered .
if , however , both should break down , the airport ’ s own 57 diesel-powered generators would take over the energy production .
these could supply enough electricity to power everything from the lighting on the runway to the escalators in the terminals .
and germany ’ s largest energy consumer , the deutsche bahn railway , is undaunted by the events in the united states .
the company believes a complete outage on its rail lines is " impossible . "
because the db runs its own power plants and feeds in electricity from several different independent energy consortiums , it would take quite a bit to bring the trains to a halt .
" in an extreme case we could even get electricity from our european neighbors , " company spokesman petra dowdall told spiegel online .
prevention and overproduction are keys the director of the energy consortium energie baden württemberg , utz claassen , attributes germany ’ s stabile energy supply to its focus on prevention and technology .
" germany is the worldwide leader " here , he told ard television .
germany ’ s electricity networks are also considerably closer-knit than in the united states .
there are fewer providers feeding from several different power plants within a regional network , and they are all integrated into the larger european energy network which stretches from norway to sicily .
european power plants always work with a considerable margin of overproduction , unlike in the united states where intense competition has forced providers to be stingy on production , pumping out just what the demand requires , says germany ’ s energy expert klaus traube .
as a whole europe could easily accommodate a loss of 3,000 megawatts of electricity at one time .
wulf bernotat , director of e.on , germany ’ s largest energy provider , is convinced that " whenever and wherever there is a power outage , an alternative plant will immediately kick in and start producing the extra amount required . "
if necessary , the plant can draw on electricity from a distant source outside the country , he was quoted as saying in spiegel magazine .
in order to continue to maintain a stabile energy flow in the future , germany must invest in its electrical lines , says istván erlich , professor for electrical-technology and networks at the university of duisburg .
in an interview with ard , he worries that although germany currently has a tightly regulated energy network and functioning power lines , the transit paths will naturally increase with their integration in the european network .
it will take longer for electricity to flow from the source to demand points and these paths are more susceptible to interruptions .
as a whole , europe also needs to increase the number of power plants it has and its surplus capacity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 16.08.2003 capturing kazaa 's kids as customers großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kazaa 's free file sharing sounds great , but it 's illegal say music industry leaders .
to listen to the many voices , it appears to be the music industry ’ s holy grail ; a quest beset with perils and insurmountable odds with a glowing prize at the end .
how do you stop internet piracy and save your business ? in reality , it ’ s more like the search for the goose which lays the golden eggs .
stopping internet piracy is indeed a goal and saving the music industry a much desired by-product but , as highlighted by the discussion panel at cologne ’ s popkomm , the ultimate reward will be getting those who have been downloading music for free to become customers and start paying for the privilege .
the title of the panel gave it away : kazaa ’ s kids as customers .
it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .
declining sales due to the ‘ free lunch ’ phenomena so frequently mentioned would of course turn around if bootleggers were stopped , but with new technology finding new ways to access music , the determined hordes would soon create alternative avenues .
to kill two birds with one stone – severely dent the power of the pirates and return the industry to profitability – the record labels must embrace the generation that threatens them and give it what it wants .
instead of a prolonged and ultimately losing war , the music industry must face up to the fact that it ’ s more a case of ‘ if you can ’ t beat them , join them … but make them pay for it . ’
twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .
" we can solve the problem by making a better service .
it has to be easy – a one stop shop .
and if you charge a monthly subscription fee of € 10 a month for such a service , that ’ s good value .
but it has to be better , faster and easier than the illegal option to work . "
providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .
" providers such as aol and t-online should co-operate with only trustworthy partners and not allow their services to be hijacked by the pirates , " he said .
" by blocking certain addresses and preventing users from reaching these sites , we could provide a virtual shopping mall where only legal sharing takes place . "
challenged by moderator tobias kniebe on the subject of censorship on the internet , schäfer explained , " the internet will remain unaffected .
it would just be a contract between two businesses – the internet provider and the legal sharing portal .

to listen to the many voices , it appears to be the music industry ’ s holy grail ; a quest beset with perils and insurmountable odds with a glowing prize at the end .
how do you stop internet piracy and save your business ? in reality , it ’ s more like the search for the goose which lays the golden eggs .
stopping internet piracy is indeed a goal and saving the music industry a much desired by-product but , as highlighted by the discussion panel at cologne ’ s popkomm , the ultimate reward will be getting those who have been downloading music for free to become customers and start paying for the privilege .
the title of the panel gave it away : kazaa ’ s kids as customers .
it would be naive to think that the quashing of internet piracy alone would save the music industry .
declining sales due to the ‘ free lunch ’ phenomena so frequently mentioned would of course turn around if bootleggers were stopped , but with new technology finding new ways to access music , the determined hordes would soon create alternative avenues .
to kill two birds with one stone – severely dent the power of the pirates and return the industry to profitability – the record labels must embrace the generation that threatens them and give it what it wants .
instead of a prolonged and ultimately losing war , the music industry must face up to the fact that it ’ s more a case of ‘ if you can ’ t beat them , join them … but make them pay for it . ’
twofold challenge : stop piracy and attract customers the german record labels have already announced a cross-industry platform which intends to provide downloadable music files for a fee .
this is , in itself , the easy part .
similar set ups are already in place such as musicnet at aol , while universal music and apple have attempted pioneering projects to the same end .
that technology is already here .
the twofold challenge currently facing the industry requires the creation of new technology which hits the pirates where it hurts and improved services which attract users from the illegal sector to a framework protected and maintained by the music industry .
mark mooradian , musicnet ’ s european consultant , believes users of such file sharing portals as kazaa could be harnessed as customers if the alternative was better .
" we can solve the problem by making a better service .
it has to be easy – a one stop shop .
and if you charge a monthly subscription fee of € 10 a month for such a service , that ’ s good value .
but it has to be better , faster and easier than the illegal option to work . "
providers need to combat piracy this is a fact long accepted by the industry itself .
however , a better service alone won ’ t stop the profits from plummeting while file sharing devices continue to operate on the blurry boundaries of the law .
dr. martin schäfer from bmg germany says that a more concerted effort by internet providers to combat piracy would be the perfect foil to the music industry ’ s attempts to bring kazaa ’ s kids into the fold .
" providers such as aol and t-online should co-operate with only trustworthy partners and not allow their services to be hijacked by the pirates , " he said .
" by blocking certain addresses and preventing users from reaching these sites , we could provide a virtual shopping mall where only legal sharing takes place . "
challenged by moderator tobias kniebe on the subject of censorship on the internet , schäfer explained , " the internet will remain unaffected .
it would just be a contract between two businesses – the internet provider and the legal sharing portal .
this would create a security wall within the internet .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- 1xtra celebrates birthday presence bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture saturday , 16 august , 2003 , 05:25 gmt 06:25 uk 1xtra celebrates birthday presence by ian youngs bbc news online entertainment staff the bbc 's black music digital radio station , 1xtra , celebrated its first birthday on saturday .
bbc news online looks at how it has fared in its first year .
victoria beckham does not seem like the type of artist to get her records played on 1xtra , the bbc 's home of hip-hop , r & b and garage .
but it was one of her first ports of call when she wanted to promote her new track , it 's that simple - a collaboration with hip-hop mogul damon dash .
the pair were in the building in july when they heard a dj not " being overly kind " to the song on air - so demanded to go into the studio to defend it .
as a result , they gave the station an exclusive impromptu interview and some welcome publicity .
it also proved that the station has carved out a reputation as an influential destination where trends are set .
beckham was there in the hope that some of the station 's street cred would rub off on her - not because millions of people were listening .
because they were not .
in fact , nobody knows how many people listen because its first official audience figures from research company rajar are not released until october .
jason mitchell , who hosts the 0600-0900 slot with iyare igiehon , says he has " no clue " how many people are tuning in .
" i just know there are people out there from emails , texts and people who we get on the line , " he said .
" sometimes we get dry days where there 's absolutely nothing - -lsb- they are -rsb- very few and far between , but it has happened . "
but he can not take that to mean no-one is listening , he says .
" you just get on with it and make it sound like there are people there . "
but after just one year , the pressure of audience figures is not crippling because it is guaranteed to grow in popularity as more and more people get digital radios .
and its position as one of the main weapons in the bbc 's battle to hold on to younger , ethnic audiences means it is important to the corporation .
in its first 12 months , 1xtra has slotted in between the sister station radio 1 , with its professionalism , and the illegal pirate stations , with their cutting-edge talent and credibility .
few of the 1xtra daytime djs or songs would sound out of place on radio 1 - its slick links , news bulletins and competitions follow the same style .
but eating into the bbc 's budget at £ 800 per hour , it is more than three times cheaper than radio 1 .
and the night-times are given over to more specialist , free-flowing shows dedicated to new music in the different scenes .
the station 's achievements include championing artists such as 50 cent , dizzee rascal and terri walker before the mainstream caught on .
and with large-scale live broadcasts coming from miami , jamaica , new york and trinidad , it has proved to listeners that it is serious about offering quality and originality .
one uk garage promoter , muks from nuthing sorted , said the station had a high profile and good reputation among fans .
but because digital radios were not common in hi-fis or cars , many never had the chance to listen , he said .
" it has n't had a great effect on the large proportion of the urban listeners just because it 's not as accessible as radio or tapes or tv , " he said .
" when digital radios become more popular it will get even better . "
the station has had to dodge its share of controversy over the last 12 months , becoming a target for criticism over gun crime and racism .
gun accusations in january , reggae producer neil fraser - aka the mad professor - said radio 1 and 1xtra " should share some of the guilt every time a black youth dies by the gun in britain " .
" bbc 1xtra has several programmes that encourage gun violence and a general ignorant agro within the black community , " he said .
but a bbc spokesman argued that the stations " do a great deal to inform and educate their audience on a variety of issues including violence and racism " .
" we make every effort to encourage positive and constructive attitudes to such issues , " he said .
the station has tackled such serious topics in its daily hour-long news programme , tx unlimited .
dj reshuffle but it failed to meet a commitment that at least 10 % of its output should be news , documentaries and " social action programmes " , according to the latest bbc annual report .
the station only hit 6.9 % , prompting tx 's length to be doubled to a two-hour daily show as part of a wider schedule reshuffle from monday .
" 1xtra prides itself on leading the pack when it comes to spotting new music and we like to do the same thing with our on air talent too , " programmes editor , willber willberforce said .
jason mitchell , who will keep his early breakfast slot , said the station was " going in the right direction " .
" i do n't think there should be much change .
i think we 've started off really strong and we 'll only get better from here , " he said .

jason mitchell , who hosts the 0600-0900 slot with iyare igiehon , says he has " no clue " how many people are tuning in .

one uk garage promoter , muks from nuthing sorted , said the station had a high profile and good reputation among fans .

" it has n't had a great effect on the large proportion of the urban listeners just because it 's not as accessible as radio or tapes or tv , " he said .
" when digital radios become more popular it will get even better . "
the station has had to dodge its share of controversy over the last 12 months , becoming a target for criticism over gun crime and racism .
gun accusations in january , reggae producer neil fraser - aka the mad professor - said radio 1 and 1xtra " should share some of the guilt every time a black youth dies by the gun in britain " .
" bbc 1xtra has several programmes that encourage gun violence and a general ignorant agro within the black community , " he said .

the pair were in the building in july when they heard a dj not " being overly kind " to the song on air - so demanded to go into the studio to defend it .
as a result , they gave the station an exclusive impromptu interview and some welcome publicity .
it also proved that the station has carved out a reputation as an influential destination where trends are set .
beckham was there in the hope that some of the station 's street cred would rub off on her - not because millions of people were listening .
because they were not .
jason mitchell -lrb- right -rrb- with early breakfast co-host iyare igiehon in fact , nobody knows how many people listen because its first official audience figures from research company rajar are not released until october .
jason mitchell , who hosts the 0600-0900 slot with iyare igiehon , says he has " no clue " how many people are tuning in .
" i just know there are people out there from emails , texts and people who we get on the line , " he said .
" sometimes we get dry days where there 's absolutely nothing - -lsb- they are -rsb- very few and far between , but it has happened . "
but he can not take that to mean no-one is listening , he says .
" you just get on with it and make it sound like there are people there . "
but after just one year , the pressure of audience figures is not crippling because it is guaranteed to grow in popularity as more and more people get digital radios .
the station has broadcast from events in locations like jamaica and miami and its position as one of the main weapons in the bbc 's battle to hold on to younger , ethnic audiences means it is important to the corporation .
in its first 12 months , 1xtra has slotted in between the sister station radio 1 , with its professionalism , and the illegal pirate stations , with their cutting-edge talent and credibility .
few of the 1xtra daytime djs or songs would sound out of place on radio 1 - its slick links , news bulletins and competitions follow the same style .
but eating into the bbc 's budget at £ 800 per hour , it is more than three times cheaper than radio 1 .
and the night-times are given over to more specialist , free-flowing shows dedicated to new music in the different scenes .
the station 's achievements include championing artists such as 50 cent , dizzee rascal and terri walker before the mainstream caught on .
the heartless crew are one of the station 's big-name signings and with large-scale live broadcasts coming from miami , jamaica , new york and trinidad , it has proved to listeners that it is serious about offering quality and originality .
one uk garage promoter , muks from nuthing sorted , said the station had a high profile and good reputation among fans .
but because digital radios were not common in hi-fis or cars , many never had the chance to listen , he said .
" it has n't had a great effect on the large proportion of the urban listeners just because it 's not as accessible as radio or tapes or tv , " he said .
" when digital radios become more popular it will get even better . "
the station has had to dodge its share of controversy over the last 12 months , becoming a target for criticism over gun crime and racism .
gun accusations in january , reggae producer neil fraser - aka the mad professor - said radio 1 and 1xtra " should share some of the guilt every time a black youth dies by the gun in britain " .
" bbc 1xtra has several programmes that encourage gun violence and a general ignorant agro within the black community , " he said .
but a bbc spokesman argued that the stations " do a great deal to inform and educate their audience on a variety of issues including violence and racism " .
" we make every effort to encourage positive and constructive attitudes to such issues , " he said .
the station has tackled such serious topics in its daily hour-long news programme , tx unlimited .
dj reshuffle but it failed to meet a commitment that at least 10 % of its output should be news , documentaries and " social action programmes " , according to the latest bbc annual report .
the station only hit 6.9 % , prompting tx 's length to be doubled to a two-hour daily show as part of a wider schedule reshuffle from monday .
" 1xtra prides itself on leading the pack when it comes to spotting new music and we like to do the same thing with our on air talent too , " programmes editor , willber willberforce said .
jason mitchell , who will keep his early breakfast slot , said the station was " going in the right direction " .
" i do n't think there should be much change .
i think we 've started off really strong and we 'll only get better from here , " he said .

he was challenged by bbc radio 4 's inside money over the lack of information sent to with-profits customers who use their policies purely as a savings vehicle .
mr naismith was speaking to bbc radio 4 's inside money although the company sends annual bonus statements to all customers , at no stage during the life of the " savings-only " policies does it send illustrations of what they might pay out at maturity .
this means customers may cherish unrealistic expectations , raised by initial projections when the policy is taken out .
twenty years later when it matures , they may be shocked by a lower than expected return .
it is not possible to do everything at once , and give everybody maximum information kate flavell , abi mr naismith told the programme , " the situation we are in at the moment is , if it is a pension policy we provide it every year .
" if it is a policy tied to a mortgage then the fsa has required us to do illustrations regularly .
" we do not as yet for other policies produce illustrations regularly .
it is something we can consider , but we do not at present do it . "
when pressed by inside money , he did say scottish widows would consider writing to all customers with regular illustrations .
industry-wide problem the association of british insurers has confirmed that across the industry , information has been inadequate in the past .
insurance companies have got these old systems with old policies kate flavell , abi kate flavell of the abi conceded : " it is not possible to do everything at once , and give everybody maximum information . "
she blamed elderly computer systems .
" insurance companies have got these old systems with old policies and it is just not possible for them to press a button and say right , from tomorrow we are going to tell everybody these things . "
the abi said it has made a start with its " raising standards initiative " , where new policyholders will get regular updates on the progress of their policy .
but the abi was unable to predict how long it would be before all existing policyholders get the same level of information .
bonus cuts millions of us have with-profits policies , the driving force behind many of our long-term investments .
but every major insurance company which sells with-profits , has reduced its payouts to customers in the last few years .
a large proportion of the final amount policyholders receive relies on the final bonus that their insurer decides to pay .
however in some cases , companies have already stopped paying final bonuses on some policies , and it is a trend that is thought likely to continue .
bbc radio 4 's inside money was broadcast on saturday , 16 august , and monday , 18 august , 2003 .
