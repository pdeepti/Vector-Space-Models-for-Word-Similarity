german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected in washington early this week .

dw-world takes a look at his expected agenda . this week , foreign minister joschka fischer becomes the fifth german cabinet member to travel to washington since the end of the u.s. military invasion of iraq .
following post-war visits by germany 's economic , finance , defense and interior ministers , fischer is heading to the beltway at a time when america could use a little international help in iraq .
since the official end of major fighting in may , 31 american gis have been killed in guerrilla or suicide attacks . earlier this week , the u.s. senate called for the bush administration to appeal to nato for military help in securing the peace in iraq .
germany , one of the most vocal war opponents and a nato member , might get the opportunity to lobby for a more central role for the united nations in postwar iraq in exchange for its assistance . sending soldiers to iraq after all ? a story in sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted unnamed sources in the government saying the overstretched german army might be able to send soldiers to iraq if it reduced its troop commitment in the balkans .

more than 2,000 german soldiers are taking part in the afghanistan force .
in total , more than 8,000 german soldiers are in deployment on three different continents , according to the defense ministry . " they wo n't confront fischer directly with demands , " bob livingston of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington told deutsche welle .
" the germans would be overstretched and they know that in the pentagon . " the americans might also tap into germany and the european union 's working relationship with iran , with tensions between teheran and washington high because of iran 's nuclear program . " germany as a nuclear weapons-free country has of course a great interest in ensuring other countries also do n't have nuclear weapons , " said livingston .

in the decade since the fall of the iron curtain , an unusual piece of real estate at the edge of germany has become the backdrop for an economic success story on the fringe of the european union . zittau - on the way to a german factory in the czech border town hrádek , holger knüpfer finishes a conversation on his mobile phone and presses the off button .
" that was saxony 's economics minister , " says knüpfer , the economic promoter of the neighboring german town of zittau .
" i 'm now waiting on a call from the czech minister . "
after 13 years on the job , knüpfer , who looks a lot younger than his 58 years , has earned a well-deserved reputation as the man who makes things happen at the intersection of the german , czech and polish borders once labeled the " black triangle . "
with europe looking to stretch its borders south and east next year , knüpfer is trying to maneouver the economically depressed region back onto the map . there already signs of progress . in recent years , dozens of new companies have set up shop in zittau , attracted by its concentration of highly qualified workers and its proximity to what economists predict will be a booming eastern european market .
saxon charm and old-fashioned hustle “ as soon as the people there start making more money as a result of eu membership , they are going to buy a new car , ” said david schaefer , the head of american engine part manufacturer cloyes , which delivers to companies like opel and skoda and opened in zittau in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david schaefer , managing director of cloyes europe , points the way to the future “ the market is going to grow in the east , but the infrastructure is still not there for small and mid-sized companies , " said schaefer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the infrastructure is here in germany , the education is here and there was a real desire to make us feel welcome here in zittau . ” so far , knüpfer has used his saxon charm and good old fashioned sales hustle to bring 27 companies to zittau since 1990 . when he started the job , he faced a city devastated by the fall of the wall .
the textile industry that once employed 5,000 workers , now only employed 600 .
businesses were closing everywhere , including an east german truck manufacturer that left more than 5,000 unemployed . “ we said at the beginning that we never wanted a big company again .
we needed to attract small companies in order to have an industrial presence here once again , " said knüpfer .
" this industrial presence is still too small , we know that .
but we can at least now say that zittau is once again an industrial center . ” brains in the west , hands in the east keeping the brains of the company in the west while eyeing up the market and drawing on a workforce in the east has attracted other investors to zittau as well . chemical coating company techno-coat came to zittau to draw on the brain pool of science graduates from the technical university liberec and the technical university wroclaw across the border in the czech republic and poland .
because their business is highly specialized , techno-coat can benefit from the research being done at the universities . knüpfer is already working on a network of cross-border contacts .
he wants to stretch the business park across the border from zittau in germany to include hrádek in the czech republic and bogatynia in poland . a tiny sliver of poland lies just across the river from zittau that is only about a mile wide and is flanked by the czech republic on its other side . next page : polish gas station , german employees 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2003 germany to get first u.s.-style tobacco suit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's 18 million smokers beginning to turn on the tobacco industry ?
the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma . in a legal development that evokes memories of the billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuits in the united states , a 55-year-old german man is suing cigarette manufacturer reemtsma , claiming the company 's products caused him to have a heart attack . plaintiff wolfgang heine says that chain smoking caused his heart failure , which ultimately led him to undergo two expensive bypass operations .
heine now wants reemtsma to pay , saying the company failed to inform him of the dangers of smoking in the 1980s .
according to the newsmagazine focus , which first report the case over the weekend , a court in the state of north-rhine westphalia has agreed to hear the € 400,000 -lrb- $ 451,400 -rrb- lawsuit .
the first proceedings are expected to begin in november . little impact expected so far , germany 's tobacco industry has been sheltered from lawsuits like those that have rocked tobacco companies in the u.s. that 's why tobacco companies here fear that if the plaintiff is awarded damages by the court , it could open the floodgates for tobacco lawsuits . but some say heine has little chance of succeeding with his suit .
a spokesman at public health insurance giant barmer told deutsche welle that he was " skeptical " about the case " fundamentally changing anything . "
he said medical files in the case would have to " without a doubt " trace heine 's illness to his smoking . together with other health insurance companies , barmer planned to launch a similar lawsuit toward the end of the 1990s , but then dropped it after the federal court of justice -lrb- bgh -rrb- threw out germany 's only other anti-tobacco case in may 2000 . at the time a smoker suffering from cancer sued two tobacco companies , but the plaintiff 's application for legal aid worth 100,000 deutsche marks was rejected on account of its low chances of success .
barmer then decided it was too risky to continue with its claim . tobacco litigation common in u.s. with close to 18 million smokers who spend an estimated € 21 billion yearly to support their habit , the stakes would be enormous if a wave of litigation were to strike . in the united states , this is already familiar territory for tobacco companies . the first lawsuit by a lung-cancer victim in 1954 in america proved to be the tip of an iceberg .
u.s. tobacco companies have since been hard hit by an avalanche of complaints by ill smokers hoping to recoup billions of dollars worth of medical bills .
there , plaintiffs allege that the tobacco companies target young people in order to hook them early and that they conduct research aimed at finding ways of reinforcing nicotine addiction . the disclosure of tobacco company secrets by dr. jeffrey wigand , a top u.s. tobacco scientist in 1993 , was turned into the gripping plot of the oscar-winning hollywood movie " the insider . "
his testimony led in part to a record $ 145 billion fine imposed on five u.s. tobacco companies - including philip morris , rj reynolds , lorillard tobacco , brown & williamson and liggett group - in july 2000 for misleading some 700,000 florida residents on the health risks of smoking . although a u.s. appeals court overturned the ruling in may this year - saying the plaintiffs should have been required to file individual lawsuits rather than a class action suit - the case remains a prominent example of the financial muscle involved in tobacco litigation in the states .
the plaintiffs of the original case are now seeking to challenge big tobacco once again in court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans expect layoffs in wake of eu tobacco ruling despite vehement opposition from germany , the european union moved to ban tobacco advertising on monday .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .
that seems pretty far off the mark to me , " blix said .
" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
" in fact , i was the one who was skeptical and critical , and said that i did n't think that the evidence was so strong , and said so to the security council , " blix said . during his visit to britain , blix has conducted a number of interviews with the media and has reiterated on every occasion that , in his opinion , tony blair over-interpreted the intelligence britain had . speaking on the bbc ’ s current affairs program panorama on sunday night , blix said it was a " serious matter " when the basis of the case for war " sort of crumbles , or becomes shaky at least . " when pressed on the question of whether he believed the united states and britain were determined to go to war and read the intelligence they had compiled accordingly , blix said : " i think there was an element of that ... the main justification after all , which we were told , and the american people were told , and united nations were told , was weapons of mass destruction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an al samoud 2 missile , capable of delivering a wmd .
three months after the main conflict ended , no concrete evidence has been uncovered that iraq was in possession of operational biological , chemical and nuclear material in contravention of un resolution 1441 . mounting pressure the lack of proof and the alleged “ sexed up ” dossier that was used to convince the british parliament of the justification for war has ratcheted up the pressure on both blair ’ s government and the bush administration . blix admitted that the absence of solid evidence was disturbing but added that he expected the search for weapons of mass destruction to eventually show results .
" there is a lot of frenzy about some of the detail at the moment and i do n't feel comfortable with the fact that no more than was discovered early on of additional evidence of weapons of mass destruction has been uncovered yet , but i believe it will because i believe it is there . " the round of interviews with the former head of the united nations monitoring verification and inspection commission -lrb- unmovic -rrb- will not be welcomed by blair .
the prime minister is already facing sustained examination by a cross-party committee of members of parliament which continues to sift through testimonies and paperwork in an attempt to discover the true basis behind the government ’ s case for war . britains feel misled the ongoing inquiry is doing little to boost blair ’ s image at home .
an opinion poll published in the british daily tabloid the mirror on monday showed that the majority of britons thought blair had misled the country over iraq .
the survey found that 66 percent of those asked believed the prime minister misled them , either knowingly or unknowingly , over the facts before he sent british troops into action . only 29 percent of voters said blair did not mislead the country - only slightly more than the 27 percent who said he knowingly gave them false information .
the rest thought he did not mean to mislead them , but did .
however , almost half of the 1,012 adults questioned still said blair was justified in going to war . uranium storm awaits blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair .
things are likely to get worse for blair before they get better .
he travels to washington on thursday into the eye of another related storm - the row over whether saddam hussein was trying to buy uranium from niger .
the claim , used as evidence by both the u.s. and britain in their cases for military action against iraq , was later revealed by the cia as coming from forged documents .
despite national security advisor condoleezza rice defending the controversial claim , saying it was substantiated by several sources , cia chief george tenet has admitted his organisation was wrong to let president george w bush include the information in january ’ s state of the union address . the cia director has said that the claims did not satisfy the level of certainty required for presidential speeches . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british government exonerated of " sexing up " report a report released on monday by the british parliament dismisses claims a senior blair aide tampered with intelligence information in an iraq report .
but it also accuses the government of relying on shaky intelligence .

a mock vote on poland 's accession to the eu took place in prudnik ahead of the june 7-8 eu referendum .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- the gas station on the polish side is busy .
fuel is much cheaper here and it ’ s only a ten minute trip by car from the center of zittau .
the petrol station attendant is bernd schneider from germany .
he couldn ’ t find work in his hometown of zittau , where unemployment runs at 23.5 % . “ i knew very few people were going to apply .
germans have these stupid prejudices about polish people and working in poland , ” says scheider .
he finds his polish customers quite easy-going and relaxed .
though he ’ d much rather work somewhere else , he says “ there are simply no jobs here . ” just a mile from the gas station on the other side of the czech-polish border crossing lies the modest town of hrádek .
only a few old buildings are renovated , with fresh coats of colorful paint on the outside .
the town square is busy , but muted .
people sit at the square café drinking coffee , others window-shop on the short street . hrádek mayor martin puda talks fast and energetically when it comes to multinational cooperation in the region . “ hrádek is one of the cities where you can see the big difference .
there were not many businesses or restaurants before , ” said puda .
“ the difference now is that the borders are more open and the cooperation works . ” the mirrored facade of the thyssen-krupp plant at hradek is a shining example of what he is talking about .
by way of a joint venture between germany ’ s thyssen-krupp ag and the czech company ferrex s.r.o. , a new company was set up in hrádek in 1996 , just across the border in the czech republic .
but ownership is now entirely in the hands of thyssen-krupp ag , pavel gorčica , the general manager of thyssen-ferex says . thyssen-krupp benefits from lower wage costs in the czech republic .
but to eva svobodova , 42 , a job is a job , even if her thyssen-krupp colleagues in germany earn more .
“ i ’ m just a small person , ” she said .
“ i was working at another company before , but it was corrupt . ” but things are changing fast .
as a result of joining europe ’ s top club , the czech republic is being forced to clean up its act . and that is one of the reasons knüpfer sees a bright future in this remote part of the world .
a cooperation pact between the three cities is intended as a roadmap that will pull the region back to economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer , wirtschaftsförderer in zittau in hradek , die tscheschische stadt auf der andere seite der grenze the booming business park is a first sign of that cross-border cooperation taking shape .
knüpfer -lrb- photo -rrb- and others are hoping zittau serves as a scaled-down model of how the bigger picture may develop in the wake of european enlargement in 2004 . arne woll back to first page back 2/2 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

an opinion poll published in the british daily tabloid the mirror on monday showed that the majority of britons thought blair had misled the country over iraq .
the survey found that 66 percent of those asked believed the prime minister misled them , either knowingly or unknowingly , over the facts before he sent british troops into action . only 29 percent of voters said blair did not mislead the country - only slightly more than the 27 percent who said he knowingly gave them false information .

a government commission has been charged with the controversial task of tracking down and returning art stolen by the nazis to its rightful owners .
but critics are casting doubt on the commission 's chances for success . rather than give herself over to the nazis , the wife of wealthy jewish patron gustav kirstein killed herself the day before the gestapo came to knock down her door in 1939 . the nazis looted the kirstein home , taking more than 80 pieces of art that only turned up 60 years later in a leipzig art museum . embarrassed that it housed works stolen by the nazis in its collection , the museum 's directors returned the works to kirstein descendants in the united states. in 2000 .
" the city of leipzig is giving back what does n't belong to it , " said the city 's mayor at the time . but the incident was anything but isolated and a new commission that meets for the first time in monday has been created to avoid such embarrassments in the future .
the commission , made up of eight members including former german president richard von weizsäcker , is charged with tracking down remaining pieces of art stolen by the nazi regime from jewish families in the 1930s and 1940s . chances for resolution increased though not given any legal authority , the hope is that the commission will nevertheless be able to solve art custody disputes between museums and the descendants of the works ' original owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss , 48 " with the possibility , in difficult cases , to call upon the commission … the chances of finding a fair and correct solution are increased , " said christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , the state secretary for media and culture in gerhard schröder 's chancellery . others are less certain about the prospects for the commission 's work .
the return of stolen nazi art has been a controversial topic for museums , which in some cases fear losing large parts of their collection .
legal channels have failed to resolve numerous art ownership disputes in the past and many feel that a commission without any legal authority wo n't have much of an impact . skeptics say commission lacks teeth " i 'm skeptical of what sort of an effect such a commission can have , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , president of the foundation for prussian cultural heritage , in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the topic will be elevated to such a high level that the process will only take longer … the most the commission can do is to add to overall awareness of the problem . " lehmann 's foundation , which operates a handful of berlin 's largest museums , made headlines in 1999 when it decided to return works including a van gogh drawing and a self-portrait of the painter hans von marées to the descendants of a jewish collector . but such moves have proven the exception rather than the rule .
there are more than 46,000 pieces of art currently hanging in museums worldwide whose provenance is in dispute according to a database set up by the german federal and state governments .
the works were all stolen or were sold in forced auctions after 1933 , the year in which the free art trade ceased to exist in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de collection of " persecuted art " finds permanent home the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2003 germany to get first u.s.-style tobacco suit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's 18 million smokers beginning to turn on the tobacco industry ?
the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma . in a legal development that evokes memories of the billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuits in the united states , a 55-year-old german man is suing cigarette manufacturer reemtsma , claiming the company 's products caused him to have a heart attack . plaintiff wolfgang heine says that chain smoking caused his heart failure , which ultimately led him to undergo two expensive bypass operations .
heine now wants reemtsma to pay , saying the company failed to inform him of the dangers of smoking in the 1980s .
according to the newsmagazine focus , which first report the case over the weekend , a court in the state of north-rhine westphalia has agreed to hear the € 400,000 -lrb- $ 451,400 -rrb- lawsuit .
the first proceedings are expected to begin in november . little impact expected so far , germany 's tobacco industry has been sheltered from lawsuits like those that have rocked tobacco companies in the u.s. that 's why tobacco companies here fear that if the plaintiff is awarded damages by the court , it could open the floodgates for tobacco lawsuits . but some say heine has little chance of succeeding with his suit .
a spokesman at public health insurance giant barmer told deutsche welle that he was " skeptical " about the case " fundamentally changing anything . "
he said medical files in the case would have to " without a doubt " trace heine 's illness to his smoking . together with other health insurance companies , barmer planned to launch a similar lawsuit toward the end of the 1990s , but then dropped it after the federal court of justice -lrb- bgh -rrb- threw out germany 's only other anti-tobacco case in may 2000 . at the time a smoker suffering from cancer sued two tobacco companies , but the plaintiff 's application for legal aid worth 100,000 deutsche marks was rejected on account of its low chances of success .
barmer then decided it was too risky to continue with its claim . tobacco litigation common in u.s. with close to 18 million smokers who spend an estimated € 21 billion yearly to support their habit , the stakes would be enormous if a wave of litigation were to strike . in the united states , this is already familiar territory for tobacco companies . the first lawsuit by a lung-cancer victim in 1954 in america proved to be the tip of an iceberg .
u.s. tobacco companies have since been hard hit by an avalanche of complaints by ill smokers hoping to recoup billions of dollars worth of medical bills .
there , plaintiffs allege that the tobacco companies target young people in order to hook them early and that they conduct research aimed at finding ways of reinforcing nicotine addiction . the disclosure of tobacco company secrets by dr. jeffrey wigand , a top u.s. tobacco scientist in 1993 , was turned into the gripping plot of the oscar-winning hollywood movie " the insider . "
his testimony led in part to a record $ 145 billion fine imposed on five u.s. tobacco companies - including philip morris , rj reynolds , lorillard tobacco , brown & williamson and liggett group - in july 2000 for misleading some 700,000 florida residents on the health risks of smoking . although a u.s. appeals court overturned the ruling in may this year - saying the plaintiffs should have been required to file individual lawsuits rather than a class action suit - the case remains a prominent example of the financial muscle involved in tobacco litigation in the states .
the plaintiffs of the original case are now seeking to challenge big tobacco once again in court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans expect layoffs in wake of eu tobacco ruling despite vehement opposition from germany , the european union moved to ban tobacco advertising on monday .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .
that seems pretty far off the mark to me , " blix said .
" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
" in fact , i was the one who was skeptical and critical , and said that i did n't think that the evidence was so strong , and said so to the security council , " blix said . during his visit to britain , blix has conducted a number of interviews with the media and has reiterated on every occasion that , in his opinion , tony blair over-interpreted the intelligence britain had . speaking on the bbc ’ s current affairs program panorama on sunday night , blix said it was a " serious matter " when the basis of the case for war " sort of crumbles , or becomes shaky at least . " when pressed on the question of whether he believed the united states and britain were determined to go to war and read the intelligence they had compiled accordingly , blix said : " i think there was an element of that ... the main justification after all , which we were told , and the american people were told , and united nations were told , was weapons of mass destruction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an al samoud 2 missile , capable of delivering a wmd .
three months after the main conflict ended , no concrete evidence has been uncovered that iraq was in possession of operational biological , chemical and nuclear material in contravention of un resolution 1441 . mounting pressure the lack of proof and the alleged “ sexed up ” dossier that was used to convince the british parliament of the justification for war has ratcheted up the pressure on both blair ’ s government and the bush administration . blix admitted that the absence of solid evidence was disturbing but added that he expected the search for weapons of mass destruction to eventually show results .
" there is a lot of frenzy about some of the detail at the moment and i do n't feel comfortable with the fact that no more than was discovered early on of additional evidence of weapons of mass destruction has been uncovered yet , but i believe it will because i believe it is there . " the round of interviews with the former head of the united nations monitoring verification and inspection commission -lrb- unmovic -rrb- will not be welcomed by blair .

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .
" we recognize that the new threats ... require effective action , in accordance with the un 's founding principals , " read the communiqué .
rise and fall of the third way it is the fifth such conference since the third way was called into action by blair and his close friend and ally , the then president of the united states bill clinton .
and when it began , the prospects looked good for modern socialism .
the third way had swept blair to power in 1997 on a wave of post-thatcher ' cool britannia . '
gerhard schröder was elected in the same year on the neue mitte -lrb- " new center " -rrb- ticket - the german version of the third way .
clinton 's democrat administration was actively practicing the word of giddens ' and eleven of the fifteen governments in the european union were social democratic .
six years on , things have moved on .
europe is trying to repair the cracks that appeared after the u.s. war against iraq split the union down the middle .
blair , once chummy with gerhard schröder is now often seen with italy 's right-wing , media mogul premier silvio berlusconi , also appears to have carved out an exceptionally close relationship with the now u.s. president , republican george w. bush , after the successful military campaign to remove the saddam hussein regime from power .
in germany , gerhard schröder is desperately reconciling running the trade union gauntlet to push through his center left reform package " agenda 2010 " , intended to revive the stagnant germany economy and keep the flagging social welfare state alive with the neue mitte philosophy .
blair , too , is begin to hear whispers of discontent from both the british electorate and uk trade unions as public services , which include the much-maligned national health service -lrb- nhs -rrb- continue on a downward slide .
a way forward speaking at the conference on sunday , blair told journalists : " we can make mistakes as progressives , as modern social democrats … it is important to realize that whilst we are reforming and changing we 've never got to give up on the basic values of solidarity , social justice and social democracy . "
whether he and his fellow modern day comrades can come up with concrete solutions to get the third way out of its current rut will be seen in the joint communiqué the conference is due to produce when it ends on monday evening .

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .
" we recognize that the new threats ... require effective action , in accordance with the un 's founding principals , " read the communiqué .
rise and fall of the third way it is the fifth such conference since the third way was called into action by blair and his close friend and ally , the then president of the united states bill clinton .
and when it began , the prospects looked good for modern socialism .
the third way had swept blair to power in 1997 on a wave of post-thatcher ' cool britannia . '
gerhard schröder was elected in the same year on the neue mitte -lrb- " new center " -rrb- ticket - the german version of the third way .
clinton 's democrat administration was actively practicing the word of giddens ' and eleven of the fifteen governments in the european union were social democratic .
six years on , things have moved on .
europe is trying to repair the cracks that appeared after the u.s. war against iraq split the union down the middle .
blair , once chummy with gerhard schröder is now often seen with italy 's right-wing , media mogul premier silvio berlusconi , also appears to have carved out an exceptionally close relationship with the now u.s. president , republican george w. bush , after the successful military campaign to remove the saddam hussein regime from power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2003 germany to get first u.s.-style tobacco suit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's 18 million smokers beginning to turn on the tobacco industry ?
the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma . in a legal development that evokes memories of the billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuits in the united states , a 55-year-old german man is suing cigarette manufacturer reemtsma , claiming the company 's products caused him to have a heart attack . plaintiff wolfgang heine says that chain smoking caused his heart failure , which ultimately led him to undergo two expensive bypass operations .
heine now wants reemtsma to pay , saying the company failed to inform him of the dangers of smoking in the 1980s .
according to the newsmagazine focus , which first report the case over the weekend , a court in the state of north-rhine westphalia has agreed to hear the € 400,000 -lrb- $ 451,400 -rrb- lawsuit .
the first proceedings are expected to begin in november . little impact expected so far , germany 's tobacco industry has been sheltered from lawsuits like those that have rocked tobacco companies in the u.s. that 's why tobacco companies here fear that if the plaintiff is awarded damages by the court , it could open the floodgates for tobacco lawsuits . but some say heine has little chance of succeeding with his suit .
a spokesman at public health insurance giant barmer told deutsche welle that he was " skeptical " about the case " fundamentally changing anything . "
he said medical files in the case would have to " without a doubt " trace heine 's illness to his smoking . together with other health insurance companies , barmer planned to launch a similar lawsuit toward the end of the 1990s , but then dropped it after the federal court of justice -lrb- bgh -rrb- threw out germany 's only other anti-tobacco case in may 2000 . at the time a smoker suffering from cancer sued two tobacco companies , but the plaintiff 's application for legal aid worth 100,000 deutsche marks was rejected on account of its low chances of success .
barmer then decided it was too risky to continue with its claim . tobacco litigation common in u.s. with close to 18 million smokers who spend an estimated € 21 billion yearly to support their habit , the stakes would be enormous if a wave of litigation were to strike . in the united states , this is already familiar territory for tobacco companies . the first lawsuit by a lung-cancer victim in 1954 in america proved to be the tip of an iceberg .
u.s. tobacco companies have since been hard hit by an avalanche of complaints by ill smokers hoping to recoup billions of dollars worth of medical bills .
there , plaintiffs allege that the tobacco companies target young people in order to hook them early and that they conduct research aimed at finding ways of reinforcing nicotine addiction . the disclosure of tobacco company secrets by dr. jeffrey wigand , a top u.s. tobacco scientist in 1993 , was turned into the gripping plot of the oscar-winning hollywood movie " the insider . "
his testimony led in part to a record $ 145 billion fine imposed on five u.s. tobacco companies - including philip morris , rj reynolds , lorillard tobacco , brown & williamson and liggett group - in july 2000 for misleading some 700,000 florida residents on the health risks of smoking . although a u.s. appeals court overturned the ruling in may this year - saying the plaintiffs should have been required to file individual lawsuits rather than a class action suit - the case remains a prominent example of the financial muscle involved in tobacco litigation in the states .
the plaintiffs of the original case are now seeking to challenge big tobacco once again in court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans expect layoffs in wake of eu tobacco ruling despite vehement opposition from germany , the european union moved to ban tobacco advertising on monday .

a government commission has been charged with the controversial task of tracking down and returning art stolen by the nazis to its rightful owners .
but critics are casting doubt on the commission 's chances for success . rather than give herself over to the nazis , the wife of wealthy jewish patron gustav kirstein killed herself the day before the gestapo came to knock down her door in 1939 . the nazis looted the kirstein home , taking more than 80 pieces of art that only turned up 60 years later in a leipzig art museum . embarrassed that it housed works stolen by the nazis in its collection , the museum 's directors returned the works to kirstein descendants in the united states. in 2000 .
" the city of leipzig is giving back what does n't belong to it , " said the city 's mayor at the time . but the incident was anything but isolated and a new commission that meets for the first time in monday has been created to avoid such embarrassments in the future .
the commission , made up of eight members including former german president richard von weizsäcker , is charged with tracking down remaining pieces of art stolen by the nazi regime from jewish families in the 1930s and 1940s . chances for resolution increased though not given any legal authority , the hope is that the commission will nevertheless be able to solve art custody disputes between museums and the descendants of the works ' original owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss , 48 " with the possibility , in difficult cases , to call upon the commission … the chances of finding a fair and correct solution are increased , " said christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , the state secretary for media and culture in gerhard schröder 's chancellery . others are less certain about the prospects for the commission 's work .
the return of stolen nazi art has been a controversial topic for museums , which in some cases fear losing large parts of their collection .
legal channels have failed to resolve numerous art ownership disputes in the past and many feel that a commission without any legal authority wo n't have much of an impact . skeptics say commission lacks teeth " i 'm skeptical of what sort of an effect such a commission can have , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , president of the foundation for prussian cultural heritage , in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the topic will be elevated to such a high level that the process will only take longer … the most the commission can do is to add to overall awareness of the problem . " lehmann 's foundation , which operates a handful of berlin 's largest museums , made headlines in 1999 when it decided to return works including a van gogh drawing and a self-portrait of the painter hans von marées to the descendants of a jewish collector . but such moves have proven the exception rather than the rule .
there are more than 46,000 pieces of art currently hanging in museums worldwide whose provenance is in dispute according to a database set up by the german federal and state governments .

the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma . in a legal development that evokes memories of the billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuits in the united states , a 55-year-old german man is suing cigarette manufacturer reemtsma , claiming the company 's products caused him to have a heart attack . plaintiff wolfgang heine says that chain smoking caused his heart failure , which ultimately led him to undergo two expensive bypass operations .
heine now wants reemtsma to pay , saying the company failed to inform him of the dangers of smoking in the 1980s .
according to the newsmagazine focus , which first report the case over the weekend , a court in the state of north-rhine westphalia has agreed to hear the € 400,000 -lrb- $ 451,400 -rrb- lawsuit .
the first proceedings are expected to begin in november . little impact expected so far , germany 's tobacco industry has been sheltered from lawsuits like those that have rocked tobacco companies in the u.s. that 's why tobacco companies here fear that if the plaintiff is awarded damages by the court , it could open the floodgates for tobacco lawsuits . but some say heine has little chance of succeeding with his suit .
a spokesman at public health insurance giant barmer told deutsche welle that he was " skeptical " about the case " fundamentally changing anything . "
he said medical files in the case would have to " without a doubt " trace heine 's illness to his smoking . together with other health insurance companies , barmer planned to launch a similar lawsuit toward the end of the 1990s , but then dropped it after the federal court of justice -lrb- bgh -rrb- threw out germany 's only other anti-tobacco case in may 2000 . at the time a smoker suffering from cancer sued two tobacco companies , but the plaintiff 's application for legal aid worth 100,000 deutsche marks was rejected on account of its low chances of success .
barmer then decided it was too risky to continue with its claim . tobacco litigation common in u.s. with close to 18 million smokers who spend an estimated € 21 billion yearly to support their habit , the stakes would be enormous if a wave of litigation were to strike . in the united states , this is already familiar territory for tobacco companies . the first lawsuit by a lung-cancer victim in 1954 in america proved to be the tip of an iceberg .
u.s. tobacco companies have since been hard hit by an avalanche of complaints by ill smokers hoping to recoup billions of dollars worth of medical bills .
there , plaintiffs allege that the tobacco companies target young people in order to hook them early and that they conduct research aimed at finding ways of reinforcing nicotine addiction . the disclosure of tobacco company secrets by dr. jeffrey wigand , a top u.s. tobacco scientist in 1993 , was turned into the gripping plot of the oscar-winning hollywood movie " the insider . "
his testimony led in part to a record $ 145 billion fine imposed on five u.s. tobacco companies - including philip morris , rj reynolds , lorillard tobacco , brown & williamson and liggett group - in july 2000 for misleading some 700,000 florida residents on the health risks of smoking . although a u.s. appeals court overturned the ruling in may this year - saying the plaintiffs should have been required to file individual lawsuits rather than a class action suit - the case remains a prominent example of the financial muscle involved in tobacco litigation in the states .

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .
" we recognize that the new threats ... require effective action , in accordance with the un 's founding principals , " read the communiqué .
rise and fall of the third way it is the fifth such conference since the third way was called into action by blair and his close friend and ally , the then president of the united states bill clinton .
and when it began , the prospects looked good for modern socialism .
the third way had swept blair to power in 1997 on a wave of post-thatcher ' cool britannia . '
gerhard schröder was elected in the same year on the neue mitte -lrb- " new center " -rrb- ticket - the german version of the third way .
clinton 's democrat administration was actively practicing the word of giddens ' and eleven of the fifteen governments in the european union were social democratic .
six years on , things have moved on .

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .
" we recognize that the new threats ... require effective action , in accordance with the un 's founding principals , " read the communiqué .
rise and fall of the third way it is the fifth such conference since the third way was called into action by blair and his close friend and ally , the then president of the united states bill clinton .
and when it began , the prospects looked good for modern socialism .
the third way had swept blair to power in 1997 on a wave of post-thatcher ' cool britannia . '
gerhard schröder was elected in the same year on the neue mitte -lrb- " new center " -rrb- ticket - the german version of the third way .
clinton 's democrat administration was actively practicing the word of giddens ' and eleven of the fifteen governments in the european union were social democratic .
six years on , things have moved on .
europe is trying to repair the cracks that appeared after the u.s. war against iraq split the union down the middle .
blair , once chummy with gerhard schröder is now often seen with italy 's right-wing , media mogul premier silvio berlusconi , also appears to have carved out an exceptionally close relationship with the now u.s. president , republican george w. bush , after the successful military campaign to remove the saddam hussein regime from power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2003 mr. fischer heads to washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state colin powell and joschka fischer are friends even if they do n't always see eye to eye .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected in washington early this week .
topic number one is likely to be nato and germany 's role in postwar iraq .
dw-world takes a look at his expected agenda . this week , foreign minister joschka fischer becomes the fifth german cabinet member to travel to washington since the end of the u.s. military invasion of iraq .
following post-war visits by germany 's economic , finance , defense and interior ministers , fischer is heading to the beltway at a time when america could use a little international help in iraq .
since the official end of major fighting in may , 31 american gis have been killed in guerrilla or suicide attacks . earlier this week , the u.s. senate called for the bush administration to appeal to nato for military help in securing the peace in iraq .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .
that seems pretty far off the mark to me , " blix said .
" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .

the survey found that 66 percent of those asked believed the prime minister misled them , either knowingly or unknowingly , over the facts before he sent british troops into action . only 29 percent of voters said blair did not mislead the country - only slightly more than the 27 percent who said he knowingly gave them false information .

the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma . in a legal development that evokes memories of the billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuits in the united states , a 55-year-old german man is suing cigarette manufacturer reemtsma , claiming the company 's products caused him to have a heart attack . plaintiff wolfgang heine says that chain smoking caused his heart failure , which ultimately led him to undergo two expensive bypass operations .
heine now wants reemtsma to pay , saying the company failed to inform him of the dangers of smoking in the 1980s .
according to the newsmagazine focus , which first report the case over the weekend , a court in the state of north-rhine westphalia has agreed to hear the € 400,000 -lrb- $ 451,400 -rrb- lawsuit .
the first proceedings are expected to begin in november . little impact expected so far , germany 's tobacco industry has been sheltered from lawsuits like those that have rocked tobacco companies in the u.s. that 's why tobacco companies here fear that if the plaintiff is awarded damages by the court , it could open the floodgates for tobacco lawsuits . but some say heine has little chance of succeeding with his suit .
a spokesman at public health insurance giant barmer told deutsche welle that he was " skeptical " about the case " fundamentally changing anything . "
he said medical files in the case would have to " without a doubt " trace heine 's illness to his smoking . together with other health insurance companies , barmer planned to launch a similar lawsuit toward the end of the 1990s , but then dropped it after the federal court of justice -lrb- bgh -rrb- threw out germany 's only other anti-tobacco case in may 2000 . at the time a smoker suffering from cancer sued two tobacco companies , but the plaintiff 's application for legal aid worth 100,000 deutsche marks was rejected on account of its low chances of success .
barmer then decided it was too risky to continue with its claim . tobacco litigation common in u.s. with close to 18 million smokers who spend an estimated € 21 billion yearly to support their habit , the stakes would be enormous if a wave of litigation were to strike . in the united states , this is already familiar territory for tobacco companies . the first lawsuit by a lung-cancer victim in 1954 in america proved to be the tip of an iceberg .
u.s. tobacco companies have since been hard hit by an avalanche of complaints by ill smokers hoping to recoup billions of dollars worth of medical bills .
there , plaintiffs allege that the tobacco companies target young people in order to hook them early and that they conduct research aimed at finding ways of reinforcing nicotine addiction . the disclosure of tobacco company secrets by dr. jeffrey wigand , a top u.s. tobacco scientist in 1993 , was turned into the gripping plot of the oscar-winning hollywood movie " the insider . "
his testimony led in part to a record $ 145 billion fine imposed on five u.s. tobacco companies - including philip morris , rj reynolds , lorillard tobacco , brown & williamson and liggett group - in july 2000 for misleading some 700,000 florida residents on the health risks of smoking . although a u.s. appeals court overturned the ruling in may this year - saying the plaintiffs should have been required to file individual lawsuits rather than a class action suit - the case remains a prominent example of the financial muscle involved in tobacco litigation in the states .

the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma . in a legal development that evokes memories of the billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuits in the united states , a 55-year-old german man is suing cigarette manufacturer reemtsma , claiming the company 's products caused him to have a heart attack . plaintiff wolfgang heine says that chain smoking caused his heart failure , which ultimately led him to undergo two expensive bypass operations .
heine now wants reemtsma to pay , saying the company failed to inform him of the dangers of smoking in the 1980s .
according to the newsmagazine focus , which first report the case over the weekend , a court in the state of north-rhine westphalia has agreed to hear the € 400,000 -lrb- $ 451,400 -rrb- lawsuit .
the first proceedings are expected to begin in november . little impact expected so far , germany 's tobacco industry has been sheltered from lawsuits like those that have rocked tobacco companies in the u.s. that 's why tobacco companies here fear that if the plaintiff is awarded damages by the court , it could open the floodgates for tobacco lawsuits . but some say heine has little chance of succeeding with his suit .
a spokesman at public health insurance giant barmer told deutsche welle that he was " skeptical " about the case " fundamentally changing anything . "
he said medical files in the case would have to " without a doubt " trace heine 's illness to his smoking . together with other health insurance companies , barmer planned to launch a similar lawsuit toward the end of the 1990s , but then dropped it after the federal court of justice -lrb- bgh -rrb- threw out germany 's only other anti-tobacco case in may 2000 . at the time a smoker suffering from cancer sued two tobacco companies , but the plaintiff 's application for legal aid worth 100,000 deutsche marks was rejected on account of its low chances of success .
barmer then decided it was too risky to continue with its claim . tobacco litigation common in u.s. with close to 18 million smokers who spend an estimated € 21 billion yearly to support their habit , the stakes would be enormous if a wave of litigation were to strike . in the united states , this is already familiar territory for tobacco companies . the first lawsuit by a lung-cancer victim in 1954 in america proved to be the tip of an iceberg .
u.s. tobacco companies have since been hard hit by an avalanche of complaints by ill smokers hoping to recoup billions of dollars worth of medical bills .
there , plaintiffs allege that the tobacco companies target young people in order to hook them early and that they conduct research aimed at finding ways of reinforcing nicotine addiction . the disclosure of tobacco company secrets by dr. jeffrey wigand , a top u.s. tobacco scientist in 1993 , was turned into the gripping plot of the oscar-winning hollywood movie " the insider . "
his testimony led in part to a record $ 145 billion fine imposed on five u.s. tobacco companies - including philip morris , rj reynolds , lorillard tobacco , brown & williamson and liggett group - in july 2000 for misleading some 700,000 florida residents on the health risks of smoking . although a u.s. appeals court overturned the ruling in may this year - saying the plaintiffs should have been required to file individual lawsuits rather than a class action suit - the case remains a prominent example of the financial muscle involved in tobacco litigation in the states .

a government commission has been charged with the controversial task of tracking down and returning art stolen by the nazis to its rightful owners .
but critics are casting doubt on the commission 's chances for success . rather than give herself over to the nazis , the wife of wealthy jewish patron gustav kirstein killed herself the day before the gestapo came to knock down her door in 1939 . the nazis looted the kirstein home , taking more than 80 pieces of art that only turned up 60 years later in a leipzig art museum . embarrassed that it housed works stolen by the nazis in its collection , the museum 's directors returned the works to kirstein descendants in the united states. in 2000 .
" the city of leipzig is giving back what does n't belong to it , " said the city 's mayor at the time . but the incident was anything but isolated and a new commission that meets for the first time in monday has been created to avoid such embarrassments in the future .
the commission , made up of eight members including former german president richard von weizsäcker , is charged with tracking down remaining pieces of art stolen by the nazi regime from jewish families in the 1930s and 1940s . chances for resolution increased though not given any legal authority , the hope is that the commission will nevertheless be able to solve art custody disputes between museums and the descendants of the works ' original owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss , 48 " with the possibility , in difficult cases , to call upon the commission … the chances of finding a fair and correct solution are increased , " said christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , the state secretary for media and culture in gerhard schröder 's chancellery . others are less certain about the prospects for the commission 's work .
the return of stolen nazi art has been a controversial topic for museums , which in some cases fear losing large parts of their collection .
legal channels have failed to resolve numerous art ownership disputes in the past and many feel that a commission without any legal authority wo n't have much of an impact . skeptics say commission lacks teeth " i 'm skeptical of what sort of an effect such a commission can have , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , president of the foundation for prussian cultural heritage , in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the topic will be elevated to such a high level that the process will only take longer … the most the commission can do is to add to overall awareness of the problem . " lehmann 's foundation , which operates a handful of berlin 's largest museums , made headlines in 1999 when it decided to return works including a van gogh drawing and a self-portrait of the painter hans von marées to the descendants of a jewish collector . but such moves have proven the exception rather than the rule .
there are more than 46,000 pieces of art currently hanging in museums worldwide whose provenance is in dispute according to a database set up by the german federal and state governments .
the works were all stolen or were sold in forced auctions after 1933 , the year in which the free art trade ceased to exist in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de collection of " persecuted art " finds permanent home the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .
" we recognize that the new threats ... require effective action , in accordance with the un 's founding principals , " read the communiqué .
rise and fall of the third way it is the fifth such conference since the third way was called into action by blair and his close friend and ally , the then president of the united states bill clinton .
and when it began , the prospects looked good for modern socialism .
the third way had swept blair to power in 1997 on a wave of post-thatcher ' cool britannia . '
gerhard schröder was elected in the same year on the neue mitte -lrb- " new center " -rrb- ticket - the german version of the third way .

europe is trying to repair the cracks that appeared after the u.s. war against iraq split the union down the middle .
blair , once chummy with gerhard schröder is now often seen with italy 's right-wing , media mogul premier silvio berlusconi , also appears to have carved out an exceptionally close relationship with the now u.s. president , republican george w. bush , after the successful military campaign to remove the saddam hussein regime from power .
in germany , gerhard schröder is desperately reconciling running the trade union gauntlet to push through his center left reform package " agenda 2010 " , intended to revive the stagnant germany economy and keep the flagging social welfare state alive with the neue mitte philosophy .
blair , too , is begin to hear whispers of discontent from both the british electorate and uk trade unions as public services , which include the much-maligned national health service -lrb- nhs -rrb- continue on a downward slide .

"
whether he and his fellow modern day comrades can come up with concrete solutions to get the third way out of its current rut will be seen in the joint communiqué the conference is due to produce when it ends on monday evening .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .
that seems pretty far off the mark to me , " blix said .
" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
" in fact , i was the one who was skeptical and critical , and said that i did n't think that the evidence was so strong , and said so to the security council , " blix said . during his visit to britain , blix has conducted a number of interviews with the media and has reiterated on every occasion that , in his opinion , tony blair over-interpreted the intelligence britain had . speaking on the bbc ’ s current affairs program panorama on sunday night , blix said it was a " serious matter " when the basis of the case for war " sort of crumbles , or becomes shaky at least . " when pressed on the question of whether he believed the united states and britain were determined to go to war and read the intelligence they had compiled accordingly , blix said : " i think there was an element of that ... the main justification after all , which we were told , and the american people were told , and united nations were told , was weapons of mass destruction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an al samoud 2 missile , capable of delivering a wmd .
three months after the main conflict ended , no concrete evidence has been uncovered that iraq was in possession of operational biological , chemical and nuclear material in contravention of un resolution 1441 . mounting pressure the lack of proof and the alleged “ sexed up ” dossier that was used to convince the british parliament of the justification for war has ratcheted up the pressure on both blair ’ s government and the bush administration . blix admitted that the absence of solid evidence was disturbing but added that he expected the search for weapons of mass destruction to eventually show results .
" there is a lot of frenzy about some of the detail at the moment and i do n't feel comfortable with the fact that no more than was discovered early on of additional evidence of weapons of mass destruction has been uncovered yet , but i believe it will because i believe it is there . " the round of interviews with the former head of the united nations monitoring verification and inspection commission -lrb- unmovic -rrb- will not be welcomed by blair .
the prime minister is already facing sustained examination by a cross-party committee of members of parliament which continues to sift through testimonies and paperwork in an attempt to discover the true basis behind the government ’ s case for war . britains feel misled the ongoing inquiry is doing little to boost blair ’ s image at home .
an opinion poll published in the british daily tabloid the mirror on monday showed that the majority of britons thought blair had misled the country over iraq .
the survey found that 66 percent of those asked believed the prime minister misled them , either knowingly or unknowingly , over the facts before he sent british troops into action . only 29 percent of voters said blair did not mislead the country - only slightly more than the 27 percent who said he knowingly gave them false information .
the rest thought he did not mean to mislead them , but did .
however , almost half of the 1,012 adults questioned still said blair was justified in going to war . uranium storm awaits blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair .
things are likely to get worse for blair before they get better .
he travels to washington on thursday into the eye of another related storm - the row over whether saddam hussein was trying to buy uranium from niger .
the claim , used as evidence by both the u.s. and britain in their cases for military action against iraq , was later revealed by the cia as coming from forged documents .
despite national security advisor condoleezza rice defending the controversial claim , saying it was substantiated by several sources , cia chief george tenet has admitted his organisation was wrong to let president george w bush include the information in january ’ s state of the union address . the cia director has said that the claims did not satisfy the level of certainty required for presidential speeches . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british government exonerated of " sexing up " report a report released on monday by the british parliament dismisses claims a senior blair aide tampered with intelligence information in an iraq report .

a government commission has been charged with the controversial task of tracking down and returning art stolen by the nazis to its rightful owners .
but critics are casting doubt on the commission 's chances for success . rather than give herself over to the nazis , the wife of wealthy jewish patron gustav kirstein killed herself the day before the gestapo came to knock down her door in 1939 . the nazis looted the kirstein home , taking more than 80 pieces of art that only turned up 60 years later in a leipzig art museum . embarrassed that it housed works stolen by the nazis in its collection , the museum 's directors returned the works to kirstein descendants in the united states. in 2000 .
" the city of leipzig is giving back what does n't belong to it , " said the city 's mayor at the time . but the incident was anything but isolated and a new commission that meets for the first time in monday has been created to avoid such embarrassments in the future .
the commission , made up of eight members including former german president richard von weizsäcker , is charged with tracking down remaining pieces of art stolen by the nazi regime from jewish families in the 1930s and 1940s . chances for resolution increased though not given any legal authority , the hope is that the commission will nevertheless be able to solve art custody disputes between museums and the descendants of the works ' original owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss , 48 " with the possibility , in difficult cases , to call upon the commission … the chances of finding a fair and correct solution are increased , " said christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , the state secretary for media and culture in gerhard schröder 's chancellery . others are less certain about the prospects for the commission 's work .
the return of stolen nazi art has been a controversial topic for museums , which in some cases fear losing large parts of their collection .
legal channels have failed to resolve numerous art ownership disputes in the past and many feel that a commission without any legal authority wo n't have much of an impact . skeptics say commission lacks teeth " i 'm skeptical of what sort of an effect such a commission can have , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , president of the foundation for prussian cultural heritage , in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the topic will be elevated to such a high level that the process will only take longer … the most the commission can do is to add to overall awareness of the problem . " lehmann 's foundation , which operates a handful of berlin 's largest museums , made headlines in 1999 when it decided to return works including a van gogh drawing and a self-portrait of the painter hans von marées to the descendants of a jewish collector . but such moves have proven the exception rather than the rule .
there are more than 46,000 pieces of art currently hanging in museums worldwide whose provenance is in dispute according to a database set up by the german federal and state governments .
the works were all stolen or were sold in forced auctions after 1933 , the year in which the free art trade ceased to exist in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de collection of " persecuted art " finds permanent home the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .

a government commission has been charged with the controversial task of tracking down and returning art stolen by the nazis to its rightful owners .
but critics are casting doubt on the commission 's chances for success . rather than give herself over to the nazis , the wife of wealthy jewish patron gustav kirstein killed herself the day before the gestapo came to knock down her door in 1939 . the nazis looted the kirstein home , taking more than 80 pieces of art that only turned up 60 years later in a leipzig art museum . embarrassed that it housed works stolen by the nazis in its collection , the museum 's directors returned the works to kirstein descendants in the united states. in 2000 .
" the city of leipzig is giving back what does n't belong to it , " said the city 's mayor at the time . but the incident was anything but isolated and a new commission that meets for the first time in monday has been created to avoid such embarrassments in the future .
the commission , made up of eight members including former german president richard von weizsäcker , is charged with tracking down remaining pieces of art stolen by the nazi regime from jewish families in the 1930s and 1940s . chances for resolution increased though not given any legal authority , the hope is that the commission will nevertheless be able to solve art custody disputes between museums and the descendants of the works ' original owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss , 48 " with the possibility , in difficult cases , to call upon the commission … the chances of finding a fair and correct solution are increased , " said christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , the state secretary for media and culture in gerhard schröder 's chancellery . others are less certain about the prospects for the commission 's work .
the return of stolen nazi art has been a controversial topic for museums , which in some cases fear losing large parts of their collection .
legal channels have failed to resolve numerous art ownership disputes in the past and many feel that a commission without any legal authority wo n't have much of an impact . skeptics say commission lacks teeth " i 'm skeptical of what sort of an effect such a commission can have , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , president of the foundation for prussian cultural heritage , in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the topic will be elevated to such a high level that the process will only take longer … the most the commission can do is to add to overall awareness of the problem . " lehmann 's foundation , which operates a handful of berlin 's largest museums , made headlines in 1999 when it decided to return works including a van gogh drawing and a self-portrait of the painter hans von marées to the descendants of a jewish collector . but such moves have proven the exception rather than the rule .
there are more than 46,000 pieces of art currently hanging in museums worldwide whose provenance is in dispute according to a database set up by the german federal and state governments .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected in washington early this week .
topic number one is likely to be nato and germany 's role in postwar iraq .
dw-world takes a look at his expected agenda . this week , foreign minister joschka fischer becomes the fifth german cabinet member to travel to washington since the end of the u.s. military invasion of iraq .
following post-war visits by germany 's economic , finance , defense and interior ministers , fischer is heading to the beltway at a time when america could use a little international help in iraq .
since the official end of major fighting in may , 31 american gis have been killed in guerrilla or suicide attacks . earlier this week , the u.s. senate called for the bush administration to appeal to nato for military help in securing the peace in iraq .
germany , one of the most vocal war opponents and a nato member , might get the opportunity to lobby for a more central role for the united nations in postwar iraq in exchange for its assistance . sending soldiers to iraq after all ? a story in sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted unnamed sources in the government saying the overstretched german army might be able to send soldiers to iraq if it reduced its troop commitment in the balkans .
the paper reported washington , berlin and war opponent france are looking to find a " face-saving solution . " chancellor gerhard schröder told german television on friday that the government 's position had not changed . analysts expect iraq to be the topic a when fischer meets this week with counterpart secretary of state colin powell , security adviser condolleezza rice and vice president dick cheney . german , european diplomatic help in iran though needing help , washington also realizes the german army does n't have much room to maneouver . plus , the united states would like to see its ally extend its presence in afghanistan as part of the united nations security force outside of kabul .
more than 2,000 german soldiers are taking part in the afghanistan force .
in total , more than 8,000 german soldiers are in deployment on three different continents , according to the defense ministry . " they wo n't confront fischer directly with demands , " bob livingston of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington told deutsche welle .
" the germans would be overstretched and they know that in the pentagon . " the americans might also tap into germany and the european union 's working relationship with iran , with tensions between teheran and washington high because of iran 's nuclear program . " germany as a nuclear weapons-free country has of course a great interest in ensuring other countries also do n't have nuclear weapons , " said livingston .
" i 'm always surprised that the germans do n't assume a stronger role . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : no nato in iraq without un if the united states hopes to get nato soldiers side-by-side with their own in iraq , they will have to involve the united nations .
that message came loud and clear out of berlin on friday .

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .
" we recognize that the new threats ... require effective action , in accordance with the un 's founding principals , " read the communiqué .
rise and fall of the third way it is the fifth such conference since the third way was called into action by blair and his close friend and ally , the then president of the united states bill clinton .
and when it began , the prospects looked good for modern socialism .
the third way had swept blair to power in 1997 on a wave of post-thatcher ' cool britannia . '
gerhard schröder was elected in the same year on the neue mitte -lrb- " new center " -rrb- ticket - the german version of the third way .
clinton 's democrat administration was actively practicing the word of giddens ' and eleven of the fifteen governments in the european union were social democratic .
six years on , things have moved on .
europe is trying to repair the cracks that appeared after the u.s. war against iraq split the union down the middle .
blair , once chummy with gerhard schröder is now often seen with italy 's right-wing , media mogul premier silvio berlusconi , also appears to have carved out an exceptionally close relationship with the now u.s. president , republican george w. bush , after the successful military campaign to remove the saddam hussein regime from power .
in germany , gerhard schröder is desperately reconciling running the trade union gauntlet to push through his center left reform package " agenda 2010 " , intended to revive the stagnant germany economy and keep the flagging social welfare state alive with the neue mitte philosophy .
blair , too , is begin to hear whispers of discontent from both the british electorate and uk trade unions as public services , which include the much-maligned national health service -lrb- nhs -rrb- continue on a downward slide .
a way forward speaking at the conference on sunday , blair told journalists : " we can make mistakes as progressives , as modern social democrats … it is important to realize that whilst we are reforming and changing we 've never got to give up on the basic values of solidarity , social justice and social democracy . "
whether he and his fellow modern day comrades can come up with concrete solutions to get the third way out of its current rut will be seen in the joint communiqué the conference is due to produce when it ends on monday evening .
but giddens - who will step down as lse director in october - does not believe his philosophy is defunct , saying he believes the third way is not dead and that the ideas it encapsulates are still relevant . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder pushes opposition onto defensive over reforms with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice .

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .
" we recognize that the new threats ... require effective action , in accordance with the un 's founding principals , " read the communiqué .
rise and fall of the third way it is the fifth such conference since the third way was called into action by blair and his close friend and ally , the then president of the united states bill clinton .
and when it began , the prospects looked good for modern socialism .
the third way had swept blair to power in 1997 on a wave of post-thatcher ' cool britannia . '
gerhard schröder was elected in the same year on the neue mitte -lrb- " new center " -rrb- ticket - the german version of the third way .

because their business is highly specialized , techno-coat can benefit from the research being done at the universities . knüpfer is already working on a network of cross-border contacts .
he wants to stretch the business park across the border from zittau in germany to include hrádek in the czech republic and bogatynia in poland . a tiny sliver of poland lies just across the river from zittau that is only about a mile wide and is flanked by the czech republic on its other side . next page : polish gas station , german employees 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma . in a legal development that evokes memories of the billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuits in the united states , a 55-year-old german man is suing cigarette manufacturer reemtsma , claiming the company 's products caused him to have a heart attack . plaintiff wolfgang heine says that chain smoking caused his heart failure , which ultimately led him to undergo two expensive bypass operations .
heine now wants reemtsma to pay , saying the company failed to inform him of the dangers of smoking in the 1980s .
according to the newsmagazine focus , which first report the case over the weekend , a court in the state of north-rhine westphalia has agreed to hear the € 400,000 -lrb- $ 451,400 -rrb- lawsuit .
the first proceedings are expected to begin in november . little impact expected so far , germany 's tobacco industry has been sheltered from lawsuits like those that have rocked tobacco companies in the u.s. that 's why tobacco companies here fear that if the plaintiff is awarded damages by the court , it could open the floodgates for tobacco lawsuits . but some say heine has little chance of succeeding with his suit .
a spokesman at public health insurance giant barmer told deutsche welle that he was " skeptical " about the case " fundamentally changing anything . "
he said medical files in the case would have to " without a doubt " trace heine 's illness to his smoking . together with other health insurance companies , barmer planned to launch a similar lawsuit toward the end of the 1990s , but then dropped it after the federal court of justice -lrb- bgh -rrb- threw out germany 's only other anti-tobacco case in may 2000 . at the time a smoker suffering from cancer sued two tobacco companies , but the plaintiff 's application for legal aid worth 100,000 deutsche marks was rejected on account of its low chances of success .
barmer then decided it was too risky to continue with its claim . tobacco litigation common in u.s. with close to 18 million smokers who spend an estimated € 21 billion yearly to support their habit , the stakes would be enormous if a wave of litigation were to strike . in the united states , this is already familiar territory for tobacco companies . the first lawsuit by a lung-cancer victim in 1954 in america proved to be the tip of an iceberg .
u.s. tobacco companies have since been hard hit by an avalanche of complaints by ill smokers hoping to recoup billions of dollars worth of medical bills .
there , plaintiffs allege that the tobacco companies target young people in order to hook them early and that they conduct research aimed at finding ways of reinforcing nicotine addiction . the disclosure of tobacco company secrets by dr. jeffrey wigand , a top u.s. tobacco scientist in 1993 , was turned into the gripping plot of the oscar-winning hollywood movie " the insider . "
his testimony led in part to a record $ 145 billion fine imposed on five u.s. tobacco companies - including philip morris , rj reynolds , lorillard tobacco , brown & williamson and liggett group - in july 2000 for misleading some 700,000 florida residents on the health risks of smoking . although a u.s. appeals court overturned the ruling in may this year - saying the plaintiffs should have been required to file individual lawsuits rather than a class action suit - the case remains a prominent example of the financial muscle involved in tobacco litigation in the states .

the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma . in a legal development that evokes memories of the billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuits in the united states , a 55-year-old german man is suing cigarette manufacturer reemtsma , claiming the company 's products caused him to have a heart attack . plaintiff wolfgang heine says that chain smoking caused his heart failure , which ultimately led him to undergo two expensive bypass operations .
heine now wants reemtsma to pay , saying the company failed to inform him of the dangers of smoking in the 1980s .
according to the newsmagazine focus , which first report the case over the weekend , a court in the state of north-rhine westphalia has agreed to hear the € 400,000 -lrb- $ 451,400 -rrb- lawsuit .
the first proceedings are expected to begin in november . little impact expected so far , germany 's tobacco industry has been sheltered from lawsuits like those that have rocked tobacco companies in the u.s. that 's why tobacco companies here fear that if the plaintiff is awarded damages by the court , it could open the floodgates for tobacco lawsuits . but some say heine has little chance of succeeding with his suit .
a spokesman at public health insurance giant barmer told deutsche welle that he was " skeptical " about the case " fundamentally changing anything . "
he said medical files in the case would have to " without a doubt " trace heine 's illness to his smoking . together with other health insurance companies , barmer planned to launch a similar lawsuit toward the end of the 1990s , but then dropped it after the federal court of justice -lrb- bgh -rrb- threw out germany 's only other anti-tobacco case in may 2000 . at the time a smoker suffering from cancer sued two tobacco companies , but the plaintiff 's application for legal aid worth 100,000 deutsche marks was rejected on account of its low chances of success .
barmer then decided it was too risky to continue with its claim . tobacco litigation common in u.s. with close to 18 million smokers who spend an estimated € 21 billion yearly to support their habit , the stakes would be enormous if a wave of litigation were to strike . in the united states , this is already familiar territory for tobacco companies . the first lawsuit by a lung-cancer victim in 1954 in america proved to be the tip of an iceberg .
u.s. tobacco companies have since been hard hit by an avalanche of complaints by ill smokers hoping to recoup billions of dollars worth of medical bills .
there , plaintiffs allege that the tobacco companies target young people in order to hook them early and that they conduct research aimed at finding ways of reinforcing nicotine addiction . the disclosure of tobacco company secrets by dr. jeffrey wigand , a top u.s. tobacco scientist in 1993 , was turned into the gripping plot of the oscar-winning hollywood movie " the insider . "
his testimony led in part to a record $ 145 billion fine imposed on five u.s. tobacco companies - including philip morris , rj reynolds , lorillard tobacco , brown & williamson and liggett group - in july 2000 for misleading some 700,000 florida residents on the health risks of smoking . although a u.s. appeals court overturned the ruling in may this year - saying the plaintiffs should have been required to file individual lawsuits rather than a class action suit - the case remains a prominent example of the financial muscle involved in tobacco litigation in the states .
the plaintiffs of the original case are now seeking to challenge big tobacco once again in court . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans expect layoffs in wake of eu tobacco ruling despite vehement opposition from germany , the european union moved to ban tobacco advertising on monday .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .
that seems pretty far off the mark to me , " blix said .
" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
" in fact , i was the one who was skeptical and critical , and said that i did n't think that the evidence was so strong , and said so to the security council , " blix said . during his visit to britain , blix has conducted a number of interviews with the media and has reiterated on every occasion that , in his opinion , tony blair over-interpreted the intelligence britain had . speaking on the bbc ’ s current affairs program panorama on sunday night , blix said it was a " serious matter " when the basis of the case for war " sort of crumbles , or becomes shaky at least . " when pressed on the question of whether he believed the united states and britain were determined to go to war and read the intelligence they had compiled accordingly , blix said : " i think there was an element of that ... the main justification after all , which we were told , and the american people were told , and united nations were told , was weapons of mass destruction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an al samoud 2 missile , capable of delivering a wmd .
three months after the main conflict ended , no concrete evidence has been uncovered that iraq was in possession of operational biological , chemical and nuclear material in contravention of un resolution 1441 . mounting pressure the lack of proof and the alleged “ sexed up ” dossier that was used to convince the british parliament of the justification for war has ratcheted up the pressure on both blair ’ s government and the bush administration . blix admitted that the absence of solid evidence was disturbing but added that he expected the search for weapons of mass destruction to eventually show results .
" there is a lot of frenzy about some of the detail at the moment and i do n't feel comfortable with the fact that no more than was discovered early on of additional evidence of weapons of mass destruction has been uncovered yet , but i believe it will because i believe it is there . " the round of interviews with the former head of the united nations monitoring verification and inspection commission -lrb- unmovic -rrb- will not be welcomed by blair .
the prime minister is already facing sustained examination by a cross-party committee of members of parliament which continues to sift through testimonies and paperwork in an attempt to discover the true basis behind the government ’ s case for war . britains feel misled the ongoing inquiry is doing little to boost blair ’ s image at home .
an opinion poll published in the british daily tabloid the mirror on monday showed that the majority of britons thought blair had misled the country over iraq .
the survey found that 66 percent of those asked believed the prime minister misled them , either knowingly or unknowingly , over the facts before he sent british troops into action . only 29 percent of voters said blair did not mislead the country - only slightly more than the 27 percent who said he knowingly gave them false information .
the rest thought he did not mean to mislead them , but did .
however , almost half of the 1,012 adults questioned still said blair was justified in going to war . uranium storm awaits blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair .

the claim , used as evidence by both the u.s. and britain in their cases for military action against iraq , was later revealed by the cia as coming from forged documents .
despite national security advisor condoleezza rice defending the controversial claim , saying it was substantiated by several sources , cia chief george tenet has admitted his organisation was wrong to let president george w bush include the information in january ’ s state of the union address . the cia director has said that the claims did not satisfy the level of certainty required for presidential speeches . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british government exonerated of " sexing up " report a report released on monday by the british parliament dismisses claims a senior blair aide tampered with intelligence information in an iraq report .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .
that seems pretty far off the mark to me , " blix said .
" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
" in fact , i was the one who was skeptical and critical , and said that i did n't think that the evidence was so strong , and said so to the security council , " blix said . during his visit to britain , blix has conducted a number of interviews with the media and has reiterated on every occasion that , in his opinion , tony blair over-interpreted the intelligence britain had . speaking on the bbc ’ s current affairs program panorama on sunday night , blix said it was a " serious matter " when the basis of the case for war " sort of crumbles , or becomes shaky at least . " when pressed on the question of whether he believed the united states and britain were determined to go to war and read the intelligence they had compiled accordingly , blix said : " i think there was an element of that ... the main justification after all , which we were told , and the american people were told , and united nations were told , was weapons of mass destruction .

a government commission has been charged with the controversial task of tracking down and returning art stolen by the nazis to its rightful owners .
but critics are casting doubt on the commission 's chances for success . rather than give herself over to the nazis , the wife of wealthy jewish patron gustav kirstein killed herself the day before the gestapo came to knock down her door in 1939 . the nazis looted the kirstein home , taking more than 80 pieces of art that only turned up 60 years later in a leipzig art museum . embarrassed that it housed works stolen by the nazis in its collection , the museum 's directors returned the works to kirstein descendants in the united states. in 2000 .
" the city of leipzig is giving back what does n't belong to it , " said the city 's mayor at the time . but the incident was anything but isolated and a new commission that meets for the first time in monday has been created to avoid such embarrassments in the future .
the commission , made up of eight members including former german president richard von weizsäcker , is charged with tracking down remaining pieces of art stolen by the nazi regime from jewish families in the 1930s and 1940s . chances for resolution increased though not given any legal authority , the hope is that the commission will nevertheless be able to solve art custody disputes between museums and the descendants of the works ' original owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss , 48 " with the possibility , in difficult cases , to call upon the commission … the chances of finding a fair and correct solution are increased , " said christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , the state secretary for media and culture in gerhard schröder 's chancellery . others are less certain about the prospects for the commission 's work .
the return of stolen nazi art has been a controversial topic for museums , which in some cases fear losing large parts of their collection .
legal channels have failed to resolve numerous art ownership disputes in the past and many feel that a commission without any legal authority wo n't have much of an impact . skeptics say commission lacks teeth " i 'm skeptical of what sort of an effect such a commission can have , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , president of the foundation for prussian cultural heritage , in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit .

there are more than 46,000 pieces of art currently hanging in museums worldwide whose provenance is in dispute according to a database set up by the german federal and state governments .

a mock vote on poland 's accession to the eu took place in prudnik ahead of the june 7-8 eu referendum .
-lrb- ap photo / czarek sokolowski -rrb- the gas station on the polish side is busy .
fuel is much cheaper here and it ’ s only a ten minute trip by car from the center of zittau .
the petrol station attendant is bernd schneider from germany .
he couldn ’ t find work in his hometown of zittau , where unemployment runs at 23.5 % . “ i knew very few people were going to apply .
germans have these stupid prejudices about polish people and working in poland , ” says scheider .
he finds his polish customers quite easy-going and relaxed .
though he ’ d much rather work somewhere else , he says “ there are simply no jobs here . ” just a mile from the gas station on the other side of the czech-polish border crossing lies the modest town of hrádek .
only a few old buildings are renovated , with fresh coats of colorful paint on the outside .
the town square is busy , but muted .
people sit at the square café drinking coffee , others window-shop on the short street . hrádek mayor martin puda talks fast and energetically when it comes to multinational cooperation in the region . “ hrádek is one of the cities where you can see the big difference .
there were not many businesses or restaurants before , ” said puda .
“ the difference now is that the borders are more open and the cooperation works . ” the mirrored facade of the thyssen-krupp plant at hradek is a shining example of what he is talking about .
by way of a joint venture between germany ’ s thyssen-krupp ag and the czech company ferrex s.r.o. , a new company was set up in hrádek in 1996 , just across the border in the czech republic .
but ownership is now entirely in the hands of thyssen-krupp ag , pavel gorčica , the general manager of thyssen-ferex says . thyssen-krupp benefits from lower wage costs in the czech republic .
but to eva svobodova , 42 , a job is a job , even if her thyssen-krupp colleagues in germany earn more .
“ i ’ m just a small person , ” she said .
“ i was working at another company before , but it was corrupt . ” but things are changing fast .
as a result of joining europe ’ s top club , the czech republic is being forced to clean up its act . and that is one of the reasons knüpfer sees a bright future in this remote part of the world .
a cooperation pact between the three cities is intended as a roadmap that will pull the region back to economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer , wirtschaftsförderer in zittau in hradek , die tscheschische stadt auf der andere seite der grenze the booming business park is a first sign of that cross-border cooperation taking shape .

the commission , made up of eight members including former german president richard von weizsäcker , is charged with tracking down remaining pieces of art stolen by the nazi regime from jewish families in the 1930s and 1940s . chances for resolution increased though not given any legal authority , the hope is that the commission will nevertheless be able to solve art custody disputes between museums and the descendants of the works ' original owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss , 48 " with the possibility , in difficult cases , to call upon the commission … the chances of finding a fair and correct solution are increased , " said christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , the state secretary for media and culture in gerhard schröder 's chancellery . others are less certain about the prospects for the commission 's work .
the return of stolen nazi art has been a controversial topic for museums , which in some cases fear losing large parts of their collection .
legal channels have failed to resolve numerous art ownership disputes in the past and many feel that a commission without any legal authority wo n't have much of an impact . skeptics say commission lacks teeth " i 'm skeptical of what sort of an effect such a commission can have , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , president of the foundation for prussian cultural heritage , in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the topic will be elevated to such a high level that the process will only take longer … the most the commission can do is to add to overall awareness of the problem . " lehmann 's foundation , which operates a handful of berlin 's largest museums , made headlines in 1999 when it decided to return works including a van gogh drawing and a self-portrait of the painter hans von marées to the descendants of a jewish collector . but such moves have proven the exception rather than the rule .
there are more than 46,000 pieces of art currently hanging in museums worldwide whose provenance is in dispute according to a database set up by the german federal and state governments .
the works were all stolen or were sold in forced auctions after 1933 , the year in which the free art trade ceased to exist in germany . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de collection of " persecuted art " finds permanent home the world ’ s first museum for “ persecuted art ” has opened its doors in the israeli city of ashdod , near tel aviv .

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .
" we recognize that the new threats ... require effective action , in accordance with the un 's founding principals , " read the communiqué .
rise and fall of the third way it is the fifth such conference since the third way was called into action by blair and his close friend and ally , the then president of the united states bill clinton .
and when it began , the prospects looked good for modern socialism .
the third way had swept blair to power in 1997 on a wave of post-thatcher ' cool britannia . '
gerhard schröder was elected in the same year on the neue mitte -lrb- " new center " -rrb- ticket - the german version of the third way .
clinton 's democrat administration was actively practicing the word of giddens ' and eleven of the fifteen governments in the european union were social democratic .
six years on , things have moved on .
europe is trying to repair the cracks that appeared after the u.s. war against iraq split the union down the middle .
blair , once chummy with gerhard schröder is now often seen with italy 's right-wing , media mogul premier silvio berlusconi , also appears to have carved out an exceptionally close relationship with the now u.s. president , republican george w. bush , after the successful military campaign to remove the saddam hussein regime from power .
in germany , gerhard schröder is desperately reconciling running the trade union gauntlet to push through his center left reform package " agenda 2010 " , intended to revive the stagnant germany economy and keep the flagging social welfare state alive with the neue mitte philosophy .
blair , too , is begin to hear whispers of discontent from both the british electorate and uk trade unions as public services , which include the much-maligned national health service -lrb- nhs -rrb- continue on a downward slide .
a way forward speaking at the conference on sunday , blair told journalists : " we can make mistakes as progressives , as modern social democrats … it is important to realize that whilst we are reforming and changing we 've never got to give up on the basic values of solidarity , social justice and social democracy . "

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .
" we recognize that the new threats ... require effective action , in accordance with the un 's founding principals , " read the communiqué .
rise and fall of the third way it is the fifth such conference since the third way was called into action by blair and his close friend and ally , the then president of the united states bill clinton .
and when it began , the prospects looked good for modern socialism .
the third way had swept blair to power in 1997 on a wave of post-thatcher ' cool britannia . '
gerhard schröder was elected in the same year on the neue mitte -lrb- " new center " -rrb- ticket - the german version of the third way .
clinton 's democrat administration was actively practicing the word of giddens ' and eleven of the fifteen governments in the european union were social democratic .
six years on , things have moved on .
europe is trying to repair the cracks that appeared after the u.s. war against iraq split the union down the middle .
blair , once chummy with gerhard schröder is now often seen with italy 's right-wing , media mogul premier silvio berlusconi , also appears to have carved out an exceptionally close relationship with the now u.s. president , republican george w. bush , after the successful military campaign to remove the saddam hussein regime from power .
in germany , gerhard schröder is desperately reconciling running the trade union gauntlet to push through his center left reform package " agenda 2010 " , intended to revive the stagnant germany economy and keep the flagging social welfare state alive with the neue mitte philosophy .
blair , too , is begin to hear whispers of discontent from both the british electorate and uk trade unions as public services , which include the much-maligned national health service -lrb- nhs -rrb- continue on a downward slide .
a way forward speaking at the conference on sunday , blair told journalists : " we can make mistakes as progressives , as modern social democrats … it is important to realize that whilst we are reforming and changing we 've never got to give up on the basic values of solidarity , social justice and social democracy . "
whether he and his fellow modern day comrades can come up with concrete solutions to get the third way out of its current rut will be seen in the joint communiqué the conference is due to produce when it ends on monday evening .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected in washington early this week .
topic number one is likely to be nato and germany 's role in postwar iraq .
dw-world takes a look at his expected agenda . this week , foreign minister joschka fischer becomes the fifth german cabinet member to travel to washington since the end of the u.s. military invasion of iraq .
following post-war visits by germany 's economic , finance , defense and interior ministers , fischer is heading to the beltway at a time when america could use a little international help in iraq .
since the official end of major fighting in may , 31 american gis have been killed in guerrilla or suicide attacks . earlier this week , the u.s. senate called for the bush administration to appeal to nato for military help in securing the peace in iraq .
germany , one of the most vocal war opponents and a nato member , might get the opportunity to lobby for a more central role for the united nations in postwar iraq in exchange for its assistance . sending soldiers to iraq after all ? a story in sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted unnamed sources in the government saying the overstretched german army might be able to send soldiers to iraq if it reduced its troop commitment in the balkans .
the paper reported washington , berlin and war opponent france are looking to find a " face-saving solution . " chancellor gerhard schröder told german television on friday that the government 's position had not changed . analysts expect iraq to be the topic a when fischer meets this week with counterpart secretary of state colin powell , security adviser condolleezza rice and vice president dick cheney . german , european diplomatic help in iran though needing help , washington also realizes the german army does n't have much room to maneouver . plus , the united states would like to see its ally extend its presence in afghanistan as part of the united nations security force outside of kabul .
more than 2,000 german soldiers are taking part in the afghanistan force .
in total , more than 8,000 german soldiers are in deployment on three different continents , according to the defense ministry . " they wo n't confront fischer directly with demands , " bob livingston of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington told deutsche welle .
" the germans would be overstretched and they know that in the pentagon . " the americans might also tap into germany and the european union 's working relationship with iran , with tensions between teheran and washington high because of iran 's nuclear program . " germany as a nuclear weapons-free country has of course a great interest in ensuring other countries also do n't have nuclear weapons , " said livingston .
" i 'm always surprised that the germans do n't assume a stronger role . " send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany : no nato in iraq without un if the united states hopes to get nato soldiers side-by-side with their own in iraq , they will have to involve the united nations .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .
that seems pretty far off the mark to me , " blix said .
" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
" in fact , i was the one who was skeptical and critical , and said that i did n't think that the evidence was so strong , and said so to the security council , " blix said . during his visit to britain , blix has conducted a number of interviews with the media and has reiterated on every occasion that , in his opinion , tony blair over-interpreted the intelligence britain had . speaking on the bbc ’ s current affairs program panorama on sunday night , blix said it was a " serious matter " when the basis of the case for war " sort of crumbles , or becomes shaky at least . " when pressed on the question of whether he believed the united states and britain were determined to go to war and read the intelligence they had compiled accordingly , blix said : " i think there was an element of that ... the main justification after all , which we were told , and the american people were told , and united nations were told , was weapons of mass destruction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an al samoud 2 missile , capable of delivering a wmd .
three months after the main conflict ended , no concrete evidence has been uncovered that iraq was in possession of operational biological , chemical and nuclear material in contravention of un resolution 1441 . mounting pressure the lack of proof and the alleged “ sexed up ” dossier that was used to convince the british parliament of the justification for war has ratcheted up the pressure on both blair ’ s government and the bush administration . blix admitted that the absence of solid evidence was disturbing but added that he expected the search for weapons of mass destruction to eventually show results .
" there is a lot of frenzy about some of the detail at the moment and i do n't feel comfortable with the fact that no more than was discovered early on of additional evidence of weapons of mass destruction has been uncovered yet , but i believe it will because i believe it is there . " the round of interviews with the former head of the united nations monitoring verification and inspection commission -lrb- unmovic -rrb- will not be welcomed by blair .
the prime minister is already facing sustained examination by a cross-party committee of members of parliament which continues to sift through testimonies and paperwork in an attempt to discover the true basis behind the government ’ s case for war . britains feel misled the ongoing inquiry is doing little to boost blair ’ s image at home .
an opinion poll published in the british daily tabloid the mirror on monday showed that the majority of britons thought blair had misled the country over iraq .
the survey found that 66 percent of those asked believed the prime minister misled them , either knowingly or unknowingly , over the facts before he sent british troops into action . only 29 percent of voters said blair did not mislead the country - only slightly more than the 27 percent who said he knowingly gave them false information .
the rest thought he did not mean to mislead them , but did .
however , almost half of the 1,012 adults questioned still said blair was justified in going to war . uranium storm awaits blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair .
things are likely to get worse for blair before they get better .
he travels to washington on thursday into the eye of another related storm - the row over whether saddam hussein was trying to buy uranium from niger .
the claim , used as evidence by both the u.s. and britain in their cases for military action against iraq , was later revealed by the cia as coming from forged documents .
despite national security advisor condoleezza rice defending the controversial claim , saying it was substantiated by several sources , cia chief george tenet has admitted his organisation was wrong to let president george w bush include the information in january ’ s state of the union address . the cia director has said that the claims did not satisfy the level of certainty required for presidential speeches . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british government exonerated of " sexing up " report a report released on monday by the british parliament dismisses claims a senior blair aide tampered with intelligence information in an iraq report .

germans have these stupid prejudices about polish people and working in poland , ” says scheider .
he finds his polish customers quite easy-going and relaxed .
though he ’ d much rather work somewhere else , he says “ there are simply no jobs here . ” just a mile from the gas station on the other side of the czech-polish border crossing lies the modest town of hrádek .
only a few old buildings are renovated , with fresh coats of colorful paint on the outside .
the town square is busy , but muted .
people sit at the square café drinking coffee , others window-shop on the short street . hrádek mayor martin puda talks fast and energetically when it comes to multinational cooperation in the region . “ hrádek is one of the cities where you can see the big difference .
there were not many businesses or restaurants before , ” said puda .
“ the difference now is that the borders are more open and the cooperation works . ” the mirrored facade of the thyssen-krupp plant at hradek is a shining example of what he is talking about .
by way of a joint venture between germany ’ s thyssen-krupp ag and the czech company ferrex s.r.o. , a new company was set up in hrádek in 1996 , just across the border in the czech republic .
but ownership is now entirely in the hands of thyssen-krupp ag , pavel gorčica , the general manager of thyssen-ferex says . thyssen-krupp benefits from lower wage costs in the czech republic .
but to eva svobodova , 42 , a job is a job , even if her thyssen-krupp colleagues in germany earn more .
“ i ’ m just a small person , ” she said .
“ i was working at another company before , but it was corrupt . ” but things are changing fast .
as a result of joining europe ’ s top club , the czech republic is being forced to clean up its act . and that is one of the reasons knüpfer sees a bright future in this remote part of the world .
a cooperation pact between the three cities is intended as a roadmap that will pull the region back to economic prosperity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : holger knüpfer , wirtschaftsförderer in zittau in hradek , die tscheschische stadt auf der andere seite der grenze the booming business park is a first sign of that cross-border cooperation taking shape .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .

" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .

an opinion poll published in the british daily tabloid the mirror on monday showed that the majority of britons thought blair had misled the country over iraq .
the survey found that 66 percent of those asked believed the prime minister misled them , either knowingly or unknowingly , over the facts before he sent british troops into action . only 29 percent of voters said blair did not mislead the country - only slightly more than the 27 percent who said he knowingly gave them false information .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected in washington early this week .
topic number one is likely to be nato and germany 's role in postwar iraq .
dw-world takes a look at his expected agenda . this week , foreign minister joschka fischer becomes the fifth german cabinet member to travel to washington since the end of the u.s. military invasion of iraq .
following post-war visits by germany 's economic , finance , defense and interior ministers , fischer is heading to the beltway at a time when america could use a little international help in iraq .
since the official end of major fighting in may , 31 american gis have been killed in guerrilla or suicide attacks . earlier this week , the u.s. senate called for the bush administration to appeal to nato for military help in securing the peace in iraq .
germany , one of the most vocal war opponents and a nato member , might get the opportunity to lobby for a more central role for the united nations in postwar iraq in exchange for its assistance . sending soldiers to iraq after all ? a story in sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted unnamed sources in the government saying the overstretched german army might be able to send soldiers to iraq if it reduced its troop commitment in the balkans .
the paper reported washington , berlin and war opponent france are looking to find a " face-saving solution . " chancellor gerhard schröder told german television on friday that the government 's position had not changed . analysts expect iraq to be the topic a when fischer meets this week with counterpart secretary of state colin powell , security adviser condolleezza rice and vice president dick cheney . german , european diplomatic help in iran though needing help , washington also realizes the german army does n't have much room to maneouver . plus , the united states would like to see its ally extend its presence in afghanistan as part of the united nations security force outside of kabul .
more than 2,000 german soldiers are taking part in the afghanistan force .
in total , more than 8,000 german soldiers are in deployment on three different continents , according to the defense ministry . " they wo n't confront fischer directly with demands , " bob livingston of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington told deutsche welle .
" the germans would be overstretched and they know that in the pentagon . " the americans might also tap into germany and the european union 's working relationship with iran , with tensions between teheran and washington high because of iran 's nuclear program . " germany as a nuclear weapons-free country has of course a great interest in ensuring other countries also do n't have nuclear weapons , " said livingston .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2003 germany to get first u.s.-style tobacco suit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are germany 's 18 million smokers beginning to turn on the tobacco industry ?
the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma . in a legal development that evokes memories of the billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuits in the united states , a 55-year-old german man is suing cigarette manufacturer reemtsma , claiming the company 's products caused him to have a heart attack . plaintiff wolfgang heine says that chain smoking caused his heart failure , which ultimately led him to undergo two expensive bypass operations .
heine now wants reemtsma to pay , saying the company failed to inform him of the dangers of smoking in the 1980s .
according to the newsmagazine focus , which first report the case over the weekend , a court in the state of north-rhine westphalia has agreed to hear the € 400,000 -lrb- $ 451,400 -rrb- lawsuit .
the first proceedings are expected to begin in november . little impact expected so far , germany 's tobacco industry has been sheltered from lawsuits like those that have rocked tobacco companies in the u.s. that 's why tobacco companies here fear that if the plaintiff is awarded damages by the court , it could open the floodgates for tobacco lawsuits . but some say heine has little chance of succeeding with his suit .
a spokesman at public health insurance giant barmer told deutsche welle that he was " skeptical " about the case " fundamentally changing anything . "
he said medical files in the case would have to " without a doubt " trace heine 's illness to his smoking . together with other health insurance companies , barmer planned to launch a similar lawsuit toward the end of the 1990s , but then dropped it after the federal court of justice -lrb- bgh -rrb- threw out germany 's only other anti-tobacco case in may 2000 . at the time a smoker suffering from cancer sued two tobacco companies , but the plaintiff 's application for legal aid worth 100,000 deutsche marks was rejected on account of its low chances of success .
barmer then decided it was too risky to continue with its claim . tobacco litigation common in u.s. with close to 18 million smokers who spend an estimated € 21 billion yearly to support their habit , the stakes would be enormous if a wave of litigation were to strike . in the united states , this is already familiar territory for tobacco companies . the first lawsuit by a lung-cancer victim in 1954 in america proved to be the tip of an iceberg .
u.s. tobacco companies have since been hard hit by an avalanche of complaints by ill smokers hoping to recoup billions of dollars worth of medical bills .
there , plaintiffs allege that the tobacco companies target young people in order to hook them early and that they conduct research aimed at finding ways of reinforcing nicotine addiction . the disclosure of tobacco company secrets by dr. jeffrey wigand , a top u.s. tobacco scientist in 1993 , was turned into the gripping plot of the oscar-winning hollywood movie " the insider . "
his testimony led in part to a record $ 145 billion fine imposed on five u.s. tobacco companies - including philip morris , rj reynolds , lorillard tobacco , brown & williamson and liggett group - in july 2000 for misleading some 700,000 florida residents on the health risks of smoking . although a u.s. appeals court overturned the ruling in may this year - saying the plaintiffs should have been required to file individual lawsuits rather than a class action suit - the case remains a prominent example of the financial muscle involved in tobacco litigation in the states .

the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma . in a legal development that evokes memories of the billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuits in the united states , a 55-year-old german man is suing cigarette manufacturer reemtsma , claiming the company 's products caused him to have a heart attack . plaintiff wolfgang heine says that chain smoking caused his heart failure , which ultimately led him to undergo two expensive bypass operations .
heine now wants reemtsma to pay , saying the company failed to inform him of the dangers of smoking in the 1980s .
according to the newsmagazine focus , which first report the case over the weekend , a court in the state of north-rhine westphalia has agreed to hear the € 400,000 -lrb- $ 451,400 -rrb- lawsuit .
the first proceedings are expected to begin in november . little impact expected so far , germany 's tobacco industry has been sheltered from lawsuits like those that have rocked tobacco companies in the u.s. that 's why tobacco companies here fear that if the plaintiff is awarded damages by the court , it could open the floodgates for tobacco lawsuits . but some say heine has little chance of succeeding with his suit .
a spokesman at public health insurance giant barmer told deutsche welle that he was " skeptical " about the case " fundamentally changing anything . "
he said medical files in the case would have to " without a doubt " trace heine 's illness to his smoking . together with other health insurance companies , barmer planned to launch a similar lawsuit toward the end of the 1990s , but then dropped it after the federal court of justice -lrb- bgh -rrb- threw out germany 's only other anti-tobacco case in may 2000 . at the time a smoker suffering from cancer sued two tobacco companies , but the plaintiff 's application for legal aid worth 100,000 deutsche marks was rejected on account of its low chances of success .
barmer then decided it was too risky to continue with its claim . tobacco litigation common in u.s. with close to 18 million smokers who spend an estimated € 21 billion yearly to support their habit , the stakes would be enormous if a wave of litigation were to strike . in the united states , this is already familiar territory for tobacco companies . the first lawsuit by a lung-cancer victim in 1954 in america proved to be the tip of an iceberg .
u.s. tobacco companies have since been hard hit by an avalanche of complaints by ill smokers hoping to recoup billions of dollars worth of medical bills .
there , plaintiffs allege that the tobacco companies target young people in order to hook them early and that they conduct research aimed at finding ways of reinforcing nicotine addiction . the disclosure of tobacco company secrets by dr. jeffrey wigand , a top u.s. tobacco scientist in 1993 , was turned into the gripping plot of the oscar-winning hollywood movie " the insider . "
his testimony led in part to a record $ 145 billion fine imposed on five u.s. tobacco companies - including philip morris , rj reynolds , lorillard tobacco , brown & williamson and liggett group - in july 2000 for misleading some 700,000 florida residents on the health risks of smoking . although a u.s. appeals court overturned the ruling in may this year - saying the plaintiffs should have been required to file individual lawsuits rather than a class action suit - the case remains a prominent example of the financial muscle involved in tobacco litigation in the states .

a government commission has been charged with the controversial task of tracking down and returning art stolen by the nazis to its rightful owners .
but critics are casting doubt on the commission 's chances for success . rather than give herself over to the nazis , the wife of wealthy jewish patron gustav kirstein killed herself the day before the gestapo came to knock down her door in 1939 . the nazis looted the kirstein home , taking more than 80 pieces of art that only turned up 60 years later in a leipzig art museum . embarrassed that it housed works stolen by the nazis in its collection , the museum 's directors returned the works to kirstein descendants in the united states. in 2000 .
" the city of leipzig is giving back what does n't belong to it , " said the city 's mayor at the time . but the incident was anything but isolated and a new commission that meets for the first time in monday has been created to avoid such embarrassments in the future .
the commission , made up of eight members including former german president richard von weizsäcker , is charged with tracking down remaining pieces of art stolen by the nazi regime from jewish families in the 1930s and 1940s . chances for resolution increased though not given any legal authority , the hope is that the commission will nevertheless be able to solve art custody disputes between museums and the descendants of the works ' original owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss , 48 " with the possibility , in difficult cases , to call upon the commission … the chances of finding a fair and correct solution are increased , " said christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , the state secretary for media and culture in gerhard schröder 's chancellery . others are less certain about the prospects for the commission 's work .
the return of stolen nazi art has been a controversial topic for museums , which in some cases fear losing large parts of their collection .
legal channels have failed to resolve numerous art ownership disputes in the past and many feel that a commission without any legal authority wo n't have much of an impact . skeptics say commission lacks teeth " i 'm skeptical of what sort of an effect such a commission can have , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , president of the foundation for prussian cultural heritage , in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the topic will be elevated to such a high level that the process will only take longer … the most the commission can do is to add to overall awareness of the problem . " lehmann 's foundation , which operates a handful of berlin 's largest museums , made headlines in 1999 when it decided to return works including a van gogh drawing and a self-portrait of the painter hans von marées to the descendants of a jewish collector . but such moves have proven the exception rather than the rule .
there are more than 46,000 pieces of art currently hanging in museums worldwide whose provenance is in dispute according to a database set up by the german federal and state governments .

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .
" we recognize that the new threats ... require effective action , in accordance with the un 's founding principals , " read the communiqué .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected in washington early this week .
topic number one is likely to be nato and germany 's role in postwar iraq .
dw-world takes a look at his expected agenda . this week , foreign minister joschka fischer becomes the fifth german cabinet member to travel to washington since the end of the u.s. military invasion of iraq .
following post-war visits by germany 's economic , finance , defense and interior ministers , fischer is heading to the beltway at a time when america could use a little international help in iraq .
since the official end of major fighting in may , 31 american gis have been killed in guerrilla or suicide attacks . earlier this week , the u.s. senate called for the bush administration to appeal to nato for military help in securing the peace in iraq .
germany , one of the most vocal war opponents and a nato member , might get the opportunity to lobby for a more central role for the united nations in postwar iraq in exchange for its assistance . sending soldiers to iraq after all ? a story in sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted unnamed sources in the government saying the overstretched german army might be able to send soldiers to iraq if it reduced its troop commitment in the balkans .
the paper reported washington , berlin and war opponent france are looking to find a " face-saving solution . " chancellor gerhard schröder told german television on friday that the government 's position had not changed . analysts expect iraq to be the topic a when fischer meets this week with counterpart secretary of state colin powell , security adviser condolleezza rice and vice president dick cheney . german , european diplomatic help in iran though needing help , washington also realizes the german army does n't have much room to maneouver . plus , the united states would like to see its ally extend its presence in afghanistan as part of the united nations security force outside of kabul .
more than 2,000 german soldiers are taking part in the afghanistan force .
in total , more than 8,000 german soldiers are in deployment on three different continents , according to the defense ministry . " they wo n't confront fischer directly with demands , " bob livingston of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington told deutsche welle .
" the germans would be overstretched and they know that in the pentagon . " the americans might also tap into germany and the european union 's working relationship with iran , with tensions between teheran and washington high because of iran 's nuclear program . " germany as a nuclear weapons-free country has of course a great interest in ensuring other countries also do n't have nuclear weapons , " said livingston .

the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma . in a legal development that evokes memories of the billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuits in the united states , a 55-year-old german man is suing cigarette manufacturer reemtsma , claiming the company 's products caused him to have a heart attack . plaintiff wolfgang heine says that chain smoking caused his heart failure , which ultimately led him to undergo two expensive bypass operations .
heine now wants reemtsma to pay , saying the company failed to inform him of the dangers of smoking in the 1980s .
according to the newsmagazine focus , which first report the case over the weekend , a court in the state of north-rhine westphalia has agreed to hear the € 400,000 -lrb- $ 451,400 -rrb- lawsuit .
the first proceedings are expected to begin in november . little impact expected so far , germany 's tobacco industry has been sheltered from lawsuits like those that have rocked tobacco companies in the u.s. that 's why tobacco companies here fear that if the plaintiff is awarded damages by the court , it could open the floodgates for tobacco lawsuits . but some say heine has little chance of succeeding with his suit .
a spokesman at public health insurance giant barmer told deutsche welle that he was " skeptical " about the case " fundamentally changing anything . "
he said medical files in the case would have to " without a doubt " trace heine 's illness to his smoking . together with other health insurance companies , barmer planned to launch a similar lawsuit toward the end of the 1990s , but then dropped it after the federal court of justice -lrb- bgh -rrb- threw out germany 's only other anti-tobacco case in may 2000 . at the time a smoker suffering from cancer sued two tobacco companies , but the plaintiff 's application for legal aid worth 100,000 deutsche marks was rejected on account of its low chances of success .
barmer then decided it was too risky to continue with its claim . tobacco litigation common in u.s. with close to 18 million smokers who spend an estimated € 21 billion yearly to support their habit , the stakes would be enormous if a wave of litigation were to strike . in the united states , this is already familiar territory for tobacco companies . the first lawsuit by a lung-cancer victim in 1954 in america proved to be the tip of an iceberg .
u.s. tobacco companies have since been hard hit by an avalanche of complaints by ill smokers hoping to recoup billions of dollars worth of medical bills .
there , plaintiffs allege that the tobacco companies target young people in order to hook them early and that they conduct research aimed at finding ways of reinforcing nicotine addiction . the disclosure of tobacco company secrets by dr. jeffrey wigand , a top u.s. tobacco scientist in 1993 , was turned into the gripping plot of the oscar-winning hollywood movie " the insider . "
his testimony led in part to a record $ 145 billion fine imposed on five u.s. tobacco companies - including philip morris , rj reynolds , lorillard tobacco , brown & williamson and liggett group - in july 2000 for misleading some 700,000 florida residents on the health risks of smoking . although a u.s. appeals court overturned the ruling in may this year - saying the plaintiffs should have been required to file individual lawsuits rather than a class action suit - the case remains a prominent example of the financial muscle involved in tobacco litigation in the states .

a government commission has been charged with the controversial task of tracking down and returning art stolen by the nazis to its rightful owners .
but critics are casting doubt on the commission 's chances for success . rather than give herself over to the nazis , the wife of wealthy jewish patron gustav kirstein killed herself the day before the gestapo came to knock down her door in 1939 . the nazis looted the kirstein home , taking more than 80 pieces of art that only turned up 60 years later in a leipzig art museum . embarrassed that it housed works stolen by the nazis in its collection , the museum 's directors returned the works to kirstein descendants in the united states. in 2000 .
" the city of leipzig is giving back what does n't belong to it , " said the city 's mayor at the time . but the incident was anything but isolated and a new commission that meets for the first time in monday has been created to avoid such embarrassments in the future .
the commission , made up of eight members including former german president richard von weizsäcker , is charged with tracking down remaining pieces of art stolen by the nazi regime from jewish families in the 1930s and 1940s . chances for resolution increased though not given any legal authority , the hope is that the commission will nevertheless be able to solve art custody disputes between museums and the descendants of the works ' original owners . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : christina weiss , 48 " with the possibility , in difficult cases , to call upon the commission … the chances of finding a fair and correct solution are increased , " said christina weiss -lrb- photo -rrb- , the state secretary for media and culture in gerhard schröder 's chancellery . others are less certain about the prospects for the commission 's work .
the return of stolen nazi art has been a controversial topic for museums , which in some cases fear losing large parts of their collection .
legal channels have failed to resolve numerous art ownership disputes in the past and many feel that a commission without any legal authority wo n't have much of an impact . skeptics say commission lacks teeth " i 'm skeptical of what sort of an effect such a commission can have , " said klaus-dieter lehmann , president of the foundation for prussian cultural heritage , in an interview with the weekly newspaper die zeit .
" the topic will be elevated to such a high level that the process will only take longer … the most the commission can do is to add to overall awareness of the problem . " lehmann 's foundation , which operates a handful of berlin 's largest museums , made headlines in 1999 when it decided to return works including a van gogh drawing and a self-portrait of the painter hans von marées to the descendants of a jewish collector . but such moves have proven the exception rather than the rule .
there are more than 46,000 pieces of art currently hanging in museums worldwide whose provenance is in dispute according to a database set up by the german federal and state governments .

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .

blair , once chummy with gerhard schröder is now often seen with italy 's right-wing , media mogul premier silvio berlusconi , also appears to have carved out an exceptionally close relationship with the now u.s. president , republican george w. bush , after the successful military campaign to remove the saddam hussein regime from power .
in germany , gerhard schröder is desperately reconciling running the trade union gauntlet to push through his center left reform package " agenda 2010 " , intended to revive the stagnant germany economy and keep the flagging social welfare state alive with the neue mitte philosophy .
blair , too , is begin to hear whispers of discontent from both the british electorate and uk trade unions as public services , which include the much-maligned national health service -lrb- nhs -rrb- continue on a downward slide .

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .
" we recognize that the new threats ... require effective action , in accordance with the un 's founding principals , " read the communiqué .
rise and fall of the third way it is the fifth such conference since the third way was called into action by blair and his close friend and ally , the then president of the united states bill clinton .
and when it began , the prospects looked good for modern socialism .

in the decade since the fall of the iron curtain , an unusual piece of real estate at the edge of germany has become the backdrop for an economic success story on the fringe of the european union . zittau - on the way to a german factory in the czech border town hrádek , holger knüpfer finishes a conversation on his mobile phone and presses the off button .
" that was saxony 's economics minister , " says knüpfer , the economic promoter of the neighboring german town of zittau .
" i 'm now waiting on a call from the czech minister . "
after 13 years on the job , knüpfer , who looks a lot younger than his 58 years , has earned a well-deserved reputation as the man who makes things happen at the intersection of the german , czech and polish borders once labeled the " black triangle . "
with europe looking to stretch its borders south and east next year , knüpfer is trying to maneouver the economically depressed region back onto the map . there already signs of progress . in recent years , dozens of new companies have set up shop in zittau , attracted by its concentration of highly qualified workers and its proximity to what economists predict will be a booming eastern european market .
saxon charm and old-fashioned hustle “ as soon as the people there start making more money as a result of eu membership , they are going to buy a new car , ” said david schaefer , the head of american engine part manufacturer cloyes , which delivers to companies like opel and skoda and opened in zittau in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david schaefer , managing director of cloyes europe , points the way to the future “ the market is going to grow in the east , but the infrastructure is still not there for small and mid-sized companies , " said schaefer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the infrastructure is here in germany , the education is here and there was a real desire to make us feel welcome here in zittau . ” so far , knüpfer has used his saxon charm and good old fashioned sales hustle to bring 27 companies to zittau since 1990 . when he started the job , he faced a city devastated by the fall of the wall .
the textile industry that once employed 5,000 workers , now only employed 600 .
businesses were closing everywhere , including an east german truck manufacturer that left more than 5,000 unemployed . “ we said at the beginning that we never wanted a big company again .
we needed to attract small companies in order to have an industrial presence here once again , " said knüpfer .
" this industrial presence is still too small , we know that .
but we can at least now say that zittau is once again an industrial center . ” brains in the west , hands in the east keeping the brains of the company in the west while eyeing up the market and drawing on a workforce in the east has attracted other investors to zittau as well . chemical coating company techno-coat came to zittau to draw on the brain pool of science graduates from the technical university liberec and the technical university wroclaw across the border in the czech republic and poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 14.07.2003 mr. fischer heads to washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : secretary of state colin powell and joschka fischer are friends even if they do n't always see eye to eye .
german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected in washington early this week .
topic number one is likely to be nato and germany 's role in postwar iraq .
dw-world takes a look at his expected agenda . this week , foreign minister joschka fischer becomes the fifth german cabinet member to travel to washington since the end of the u.s. military invasion of iraq .
following post-war visits by germany 's economic , finance , defense and interior ministers , fischer is heading to the beltway at a time when america could use a little international help in iraq .
since the official end of major fighting in may , 31 american gis have been killed in guerrilla or suicide attacks . earlier this week , the u.s. senate called for the bush administration to appeal to nato for military help in securing the peace in iraq .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .
that seems pretty far off the mark to me , " blix said .
" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
" in fact , i was the one who was skeptical and critical , and said that i did n't think that the evidence was so strong , and said so to the security council , " blix said . during his visit to britain , blix has conducted a number of interviews with the media and has reiterated on every occasion that , in his opinion , tony blair over-interpreted the intelligence britain had . speaking on the bbc ’ s current affairs program panorama on sunday night , blix said it was a " serious matter " when the basis of the case for war " sort of crumbles , or becomes shaky at least . " when pressed on the question of whether he believed the united states and britain were determined to go to war and read the intelligence they had compiled accordingly , blix said : " i think there was an element of that ... the main justification after all , which we were told , and the american people were told , and united nations were told , was weapons of mass destruction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an al samoud 2 missile , capable of delivering a wmd .
three months after the main conflict ended , no concrete evidence has been uncovered that iraq was in possession of operational biological , chemical and nuclear material in contravention of un resolution 1441 . mounting pressure the lack of proof and the alleged “ sexed up ” dossier that was used to convince the british parliament of the justification for war has ratcheted up the pressure on both blair ’ s government and the bush administration . blix admitted that the absence of solid evidence was disturbing but added that he expected the search for weapons of mass destruction to eventually show results .
" there is a lot of frenzy about some of the detail at the moment and i do n't feel comfortable with the fact that no more than was discovered early on of additional evidence of weapons of mass destruction has been uncovered yet , but i believe it will because i believe it is there . " the round of interviews with the former head of the united nations monitoring verification and inspection commission -lrb- unmovic -rrb- will not be welcomed by blair .
the prime minister is already facing sustained examination by a cross-party committee of members of parliament which continues to sift through testimonies and paperwork in an attempt to discover the true basis behind the government ’ s case for war . britains feel misled the ongoing inquiry is doing little to boost blair ’ s image at home .
an opinion poll published in the british daily tabloid the mirror on monday showed that the majority of britons thought blair had misled the country over iraq .
the survey found that 66 percent of those asked believed the prime minister misled them , either knowingly or unknowingly , over the facts before he sent british troops into action . only 29 percent of voters said blair did not mislead the country - only slightly more than the 27 percent who said he knowingly gave them false information .
the rest thought he did not mean to mislead them , but did .
however , almost half of the 1,012 adults questioned still said blair was justified in going to war . uranium storm awaits blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair .
things are likely to get worse for blair before they get better .
he travels to washington on thursday into the eye of another related storm - the row over whether saddam hussein was trying to buy uranium from niger .
the claim , used as evidence by both the u.s. and britain in their cases for military action against iraq , was later revealed by the cia as coming from forged documents .
despite national security advisor condoleezza rice defending the controversial claim , saying it was substantiated by several sources , cia chief george tenet has admitted his organisation was wrong to let president george w bush include the information in january ’ s state of the union address . the cia director has said that the claims did not satisfy the level of certainty required for presidential speeches . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british government exonerated of " sexing up " report a report released on monday by the british parliament dismisses claims a senior blair aide tampered with intelligence information in an iraq report .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .
that seems pretty far off the mark to me , " blix said .
" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
" in fact , i was the one who was skeptical and critical , and said that i did n't think that the evidence was so strong , and said so to the security council , " blix said . during his visit to britain , blix has conducted a number of interviews with the media and has reiterated on every occasion that , in his opinion , tony blair over-interpreted the intelligence britain had . speaking on the bbc ’ s current affairs program panorama on sunday night , blix said it was a " serious matter " when the basis of the case for war " sort of crumbles , or becomes shaky at least . " when pressed on the question of whether he believed the united states and britain were determined to go to war and read the intelligence they had compiled accordingly , blix said : " i think there was an element of that ... the main justification after all , which we were told , and the american people were told , and united nations were told , was weapons of mass destruction .

an opinion poll published in the british daily tabloid the mirror on monday showed that the majority of britons thought blair had misled the country over iraq .
the survey found that 66 percent of those asked believed the prime minister misled them , either knowingly or unknowingly , over the facts before he sent british troops into action . only 29 percent of voters said blair did not mislead the country - only slightly more than the 27 percent who said he knowingly gave them false information .

the claim , used as evidence by both the u.s. and britain in their cases for military action against iraq , was later revealed by the cia as coming from forged documents .
despite national security advisor condoleezza rice defending the controversial claim , saying it was substantiated by several sources , cia chief george tenet has admitted his organisation was wrong to let president george w bush include the information in january ’ s state of the union address . the cia director has said that the claims did not satisfy the level of certainty required for presidential speeches . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british government exonerated of " sexing up " report a report released on monday by the british parliament dismisses claims a senior blair aide tampered with intelligence information in an iraq report .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .
that seems pretty far off the mark to me , " blix said .
" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
" in fact , i was the one who was skeptical and critical , and said that i did n't think that the evidence was so strong , and said so to the security council , " blix said . during his visit to britain , blix has conducted a number of interviews with the media and has reiterated on every occasion that , in his opinion , tony blair over-interpreted the intelligence britain had . speaking on the bbc ’ s current affairs program panorama on sunday night , blix said it was a " serious matter " when the basis of the case for war " sort of crumbles , or becomes shaky at least . " when pressed on the question of whether he believed the united states and britain were determined to go to war and read the intelligence they had compiled accordingly , blix said : " i think there was an element of that ... the main justification after all , which we were told , and the american people were told , and united nations were told , was weapons of mass destruction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an al samoud 2 missile , capable of delivering a wmd .

the battle against tobacco giants , long raging in the u.s. legal system , may have arrived in germany as a court here for the first time admits a lawsuit by a chain smoker against cigarette-maker reemtsma . in a legal development that evokes memories of the billion dollar anti-tobacco lawsuits in the united states , a 55-year-old german man is suing cigarette manufacturer reemtsma , claiming the company 's products caused him to have a heart attack . plaintiff wolfgang heine says that chain smoking caused his heart failure , which ultimately led him to undergo two expensive bypass operations .
heine now wants reemtsma to pay , saying the company failed to inform him of the dangers of smoking in the 1980s .
according to the newsmagazine focus , which first report the case over the weekend , a court in the state of north-rhine westphalia has agreed to hear the € 400,000 -lrb- $ 451,400 -rrb- lawsuit .
the first proceedings are expected to begin in november . little impact expected so far , germany 's tobacco industry has been sheltered from lawsuits like those that have rocked tobacco companies in the u.s. that 's why tobacco companies here fear that if the plaintiff is awarded damages by the court , it could open the floodgates for tobacco lawsuits . but some say heine has little chance of succeeding with his suit .
a spokesman at public health insurance giant barmer told deutsche welle that he was " skeptical " about the case " fundamentally changing anything . "
he said medical files in the case would have to " without a doubt " trace heine 's illness to his smoking . together with other health insurance companies , barmer planned to launch a similar lawsuit toward the end of the 1990s , but then dropped it after the federal court of justice -lrb- bgh -rrb- threw out germany 's only other anti-tobacco case in may 2000 . at the time a smoker suffering from cancer sued two tobacco companies , but the plaintiff 's application for legal aid worth 100,000 deutsche marks was rejected on account of its low chances of success .
barmer then decided it was too risky to continue with its claim . tobacco litigation common in u.s. with close to 18 million smokers who spend an estimated € 21 billion yearly to support their habit , the stakes would be enormous if a wave of litigation were to strike . in the united states , this is already familiar territory for tobacco companies . the first lawsuit by a lung-cancer victim in 1954 in america proved to be the tip of an iceberg .
u.s. tobacco companies have since been hard hit by an avalanche of complaints by ill smokers hoping to recoup billions of dollars worth of medical bills .
there , plaintiffs allege that the tobacco companies target young people in order to hook them early and that they conduct research aimed at finding ways of reinforcing nicotine addiction . the disclosure of tobacco company secrets by dr. jeffrey wigand , a top u.s. tobacco scientist in 1993 , was turned into the gripping plot of the oscar-winning hollywood movie " the insider . "
his testimony led in part to a record $ 145 billion fine imposed on five u.s. tobacco companies - including philip morris , rj reynolds , lorillard tobacco , brown & williamson and liggett group - in july 2000 for misleading some 700,000 florida residents on the health risks of smoking . although a u.s. appeals court overturned the ruling in may this year - saying the plaintiffs should have been required to file individual lawsuits rather than a class action suit - the case remains a prominent example of the financial muscle involved in tobacco litigation in the states .

a government commission has been charged with the controversial task of tracking down and returning art stolen by the nazis to its rightful owners .
but critics are casting doubt on the commission 's chances for success . rather than give herself over to the nazis , the wife of wealthy jewish patron gustav kirstein killed herself the day before the gestapo came to knock down her door in 1939 . the nazis looted the kirstein home , taking more than 80 pieces of art that only turned up 60 years later in a leipzig art museum . embarrassed that it housed works stolen by the nazis in its collection , the museum 's directors returned the works to kirstein descendants in the united states. in 2000 .

gerhard schröder and tony blair are among center-left leaders plotting a new course for social democracy at a conference on progressive governance .
but have they got lost on their journey along the " third way ? " it was once considered the savior of the new left .
britain ’ s tony blair , germany ’ s gerhard schröder , and sweden ’ s göran perrson were all champions of the new road to progressive socialism .
now the " third way " is regarded as hackneyed and seems to be running out of steam . but center-left leaders , meeting for an international conference in london on monday and tuesday , are hoping it ’ s not too late to save social democracy .
they want to breathe new life into the third way - a philosophy of governance which cuts a path between capitalism and socialism , as put forth by london school of economics director and celebrated sociologist anthony giddens .
britain ’ s prime minister tony blair , who is hosting the two-day " progressive governance " conference , will be joined among others by german chancellor gerhard schröder , swedish prime minister göran perrson , polish president aleksander kwasniewski , canadian premier jean chrétien and the recently elected socialist president of brazil , luiz lula da silva .
in a communiqué released monday evening , the leaders pledged their commitment to a broad center-left agenda .
in social and economic policy , they called for changes in u.s. and european union agricultural policies , a reduction of carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the kyoto protocol and more investment in children .
addressing global security , the group , whose leaders were split on america 's military invasion of iraq , said they wanted to reaffirm the role of the united nations and commit to a mutilateralist foreign policy .
" we recognize that the new threats ... require effective action , in accordance with the un 's founding principals , " read the communiqué .
rise and fall of the third way it is the fifth such conference since the third way was called into action by blair and his close friend and ally , the then president of the united states bill clinton .
and when it began , the prospects looked good for modern socialism .
the third way had swept blair to power in 1997 on a wave of post-thatcher ' cool britannia . '
gerhard schröder was elected in the same year on the neue mitte -lrb- " new center " -rrb- ticket - the german version of the third way .
clinton 's democrat administration was actively practicing the word of giddens ' and eleven of the fifteen governments in the european union were social democratic .
six years on , things have moved on .
europe is trying to repair the cracks that appeared after the u.s. war against iraq split the union down the middle .
blair , once chummy with gerhard schröder is now often seen with italy 's right-wing , media mogul premier silvio berlusconi , also appears to have carved out an exceptionally close relationship with the now u.s. president , republican george w. bush , after the successful military campaign to remove the saddam hussein regime from power .
in germany , gerhard schröder is desperately reconciling running the trade union gauntlet to push through his center left reform package " agenda 2010 " , intended to revive the stagnant germany economy and keep the flagging social welfare state alive with the neue mitte philosophy .
blair , too , is begin to hear whispers of discontent from both the british electorate and uk trade unions as public services , which include the much-maligned national health service -lrb- nhs -rrb- continue on a downward slide .
a way forward speaking at the conference on sunday , blair told journalists : " we can make mistakes as progressives , as modern social democrats … it is important to realize that whilst we are reforming and changing we 've never got to give up on the basic values of solidarity , social justice and social democracy . "
whether he and his fellow modern day comrades can come up with concrete solutions to get the third way out of its current rut will be seen in the joint communiqué the conference is due to produce when it ends on monday evening .
but giddens - who will step down as lse director in october - does not believe his philosophy is defunct , saying he believes the third way is not dead and that the ideas it encapsulates are still relevant . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder pushes opposition onto defensive over reforms with the differences narrowing between the german government 's reform plans and those of the opposition , chancellor schröder ’ s speech before parliament thursday has left the christian democrats with a difficult choice .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .
that seems pretty far off the mark to me , " blix said .
" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
" in fact , i was the one who was skeptical and critical , and said that i did n't think that the evidence was so strong , and said so to the security council , " blix said . during his visit to britain , blix has conducted a number of interviews with the media and has reiterated on every occasion that , in his opinion , tony blair over-interpreted the intelligence britain had . speaking on the bbc ’ s current affairs program panorama on sunday night , blix said it was a " serious matter " when the basis of the case for war " sort of crumbles , or becomes shaky at least . " when pressed on the question of whether he believed the united states and britain were determined to go to war and read the intelligence they had compiled accordingly , blix said : " i think there was an element of that ... the main justification after all , which we were told , and the american people were told , and united nations were told , was weapons of mass destruction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an al samoud 2 missile , capable of delivering a wmd .
three months after the main conflict ended , no concrete evidence has been uncovered that iraq was in possession of operational biological , chemical and nuclear material in contravention of un resolution 1441 . mounting pressure the lack of proof and the alleged “ sexed up ” dossier that was used to convince the british parliament of the justification for war has ratcheted up the pressure on both blair ’ s government and the bush administration . blix admitted that the absence of solid evidence was disturbing but added that he expected the search for weapons of mass destruction to eventually show results .
" there is a lot of frenzy about some of the detail at the moment and i do n't feel comfortable with the fact that no more than was discovered early on of additional evidence of weapons of mass destruction has been uncovered yet , but i believe it will because i believe it is there . " the round of interviews with the former head of the united nations monitoring verification and inspection commission -lrb- unmovic -rrb- will not be welcomed by blair .
the prime minister is already facing sustained examination by a cross-party committee of members of parliament which continues to sift through testimonies and paperwork in an attempt to discover the true basis behind the government ’ s case for war . britains feel misled the ongoing inquiry is doing little to boost blair ’ s image at home .
an opinion poll published in the british daily tabloid the mirror on monday showed that the majority of britons thought blair had misled the country over iraq .
the survey found that 66 percent of those asked believed the prime minister misled them , either knowingly or unknowingly , over the facts before he sent british troops into action . only 29 percent of voters said blair did not mislead the country - only slightly more than the 27 percent who said he knowingly gave them false information .
the rest thought he did not mean to mislead them , but did .
however , almost half of the 1,012 adults questioned still said blair was justified in going to war . uranium storm awaits blair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair .
things are likely to get worse for blair before they get better .
he travels to washington on thursday into the eye of another related storm - the row over whether saddam hussein was trying to buy uranium from niger .
the claim , used as evidence by both the u.s. and britain in their cases for military action against iraq , was later revealed by the cia as coming from forged documents .
despite national security advisor condoleezza rice defending the controversial claim , saying it was substantiated by several sources , cia chief george tenet has admitted his organisation was wrong to let president george w bush include the information in january ’ s state of the union address . the cia director has said that the claims did not satisfy the level of certainty required for presidential speeches . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de british government exonerated of " sexing up " report a report released on monday by the british parliament dismisses claims a senior blair aide tampered with intelligence information in an iraq report .

saxon charm and old-fashioned hustle “ as soon as the people there start making more money as a result of eu membership , they are going to buy a new car , ” said david schaefer , the head of american engine part manufacturer cloyes , which delivers to companies like opel and skoda and opened in zittau in 2002 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david schaefer , managing director of cloyes europe , points the way to the future “ the market is going to grow in the east , but the infrastructure is still not there for small and mid-sized companies , " said schaefer -lrb- photo -rrb- .
" the infrastructure is here in germany , the education is here and there was a real desire to make us feel welcome here in zittau . ” so far , knüpfer has used his saxon charm and good old fashioned sales hustle to bring 27 companies to zittau since 1990 . when he started the job , he faced a city devastated by the fall of the wall .
the textile industry that once employed 5,000 workers , now only employed 600 .
businesses were closing everywhere , including an east german truck manufacturer that left more than 5,000 unemployed . “ we said at the beginning that we never wanted a big company again .
we needed to attract small companies in order to have an industrial presence here once again , " said knüpfer .
" this industrial presence is still too small , we know that .
but we can at least now say that zittau is once again an industrial center . ” brains in the west , hands in the east keeping the brains of the company in the west while eyeing up the market and drawing on a workforce in the east has attracted other investors to zittau as well . chemical coating company techno-coat came to zittau to draw on the brain pool of science graduates from the technical university liberec and the technical university wroclaw across the border in the czech republic and poland .
because their business is highly specialized , techno-coat can benefit from the research being done at the universities . knüpfer is already working on a network of cross-border contacts .
he wants to stretch the business park across the border from zittau in germany to include hrádek in the czech republic and bogatynia in poland . a tiny sliver of poland lies just across the river from zittau that is only about a mile wide and is flanked by the czech republic on its other side . next page : polish gas station , german employees 1/2 ahead send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

german foreign minister joschka fischer is expected in washington early this week .
topic number one is likely to be nato and germany 's role in postwar iraq .
dw-world takes a look at his expected agenda . this week , foreign minister joschka fischer becomes the fifth german cabinet member to travel to washington since the end of the u.s. military invasion of iraq .
following post-war visits by germany 's economic , finance , defense and interior ministers , fischer is heading to the beltway at a time when america could use a little international help in iraq .
since the official end of major fighting in may , 31 american gis have been killed in guerrilla or suicide attacks . earlier this week , the u.s. senate called for the bush administration to appeal to nato for military help in securing the peace in iraq .
germany , one of the most vocal war opponents and a nato member , might get the opportunity to lobby for a more central role for the united nations in postwar iraq in exchange for its assistance . sending soldiers to iraq after all ? a story in sunday 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung quoted unnamed sources in the government saying the overstretched german army might be able to send soldiers to iraq if it reduced its troop commitment in the balkans .
the paper reported washington , berlin and war opponent france are looking to find a " face-saving solution . " chancellor gerhard schröder told german television on friday that the government 's position had not changed . analysts expect iraq to be the topic a when fischer meets this week with counterpart secretary of state colin powell , security adviser condolleezza rice and vice president dick cheney . german , european diplomatic help in iran though needing help , washington also realizes the german army does n't have much room to maneouver . plus , the united states would like to see its ally extend its presence in afghanistan as part of the united nations security force outside of kabul .
more than 2,000 german soldiers are taking part in the afghanistan force .
in total , more than 8,000 german soldiers are in deployment on three different continents , according to the defense ministry . " they wo n't confront fischer directly with demands , " bob livingston of the institute for contemporary german studies in washington told deutsche welle .
" the germans would be overstretched and they know that in the pentagon . " the americans might also tap into germany and the european union 's working relationship with iran , with tensions between teheran and washington high because of iran 's nuclear program . " germany as a nuclear weapons-free country has of course a great interest in ensuring other countries also do n't have nuclear weapons , " said livingston .

“ i do n't know exactly how they calculated this figure of 45 minutes in the dossier of september last year .
that seems pretty far off the mark to me , " blix said .
" it seems to me highly unlikely that there were any means of delivering biological or chemical weapons within 45 minutes . ” blair was " strongly convinced " blix said prime minister blair had told him on several occasions he was " strongly convinced " of the existence of weapons of mass destruction .
" in fact , i was the one who was skeptical and critical , and said that i did n't think that the evidence was so strong , and said so to the security council , " blix said . during his visit to britain , blix has conducted a number of interviews with the media and has reiterated on every occasion that , in his opinion , tony blair over-interpreted the intelligence britain had . speaking on the bbc ’ s current affairs program panorama on sunday night , blix said it was a " serious matter " when the basis of the case for war " sort of crumbles , or becomes shaky at least . " when pressed on the question of whether he believed the united states and britain were determined to go to war and read the intelligence they had compiled accordingly , blix said : " i think there was an element of that ... the main justification after all , which we were told , and the american people were told , and united nations were told , was weapons of mass destruction . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an al samoud 2 missile , capable of delivering a wmd .
three months after the main conflict ended , no concrete evidence has been uncovered that iraq was in possession of operational biological , chemical and nuclear material in contravention of un resolution 1441 . mounting pressure the lack of proof and the alleged “ sexed up ” dossier that was used to convince the british parliament of the justification for war has ratcheted up the pressure on both blair ’ s government and the bush administration . blix admitted that the absence of solid evidence was disturbing but added that he expected the search for weapons of mass destruction to eventually show results .
" there is a lot of frenzy about some of the detail at the moment and i do n't feel comfortable with the fact that no more than was discovered early on of additional evidence of weapons of mass destruction has been uncovered yet , but i believe it will because i believe it is there .

an opinion poll published in the british daily tabloid the mirror on monday showed that the majority of britons thought blair had misled the country over iraq .
the survey found that 66 percent of those asked believed the prime minister misled them , either knowingly or unknowingly , over the facts before he sent british troops into action . only 29 percent of voters said blair did not mislead the country - only slightly more than the 27 percent who said he knowingly gave them false information .

the claim , used as evidence by both the u.s. and britain in their cases for military action against iraq , was later revealed by the cia as coming from forged documents .

an elderly chechen woman standing nearby says the two brothers artur , 5 , and timur , 3 , have n't seen their father , dzhabrail tashukhadjiev in nine months .
dzhabrail , is another victim of the fourth year of conflict in chechnya .
and his two sons , now forced to live in a cattle shed in neighbouring ingushetia , are just one family of over 80,000 refugees unable to return home .
the family comes from the kurchaloi district of chechnya , as did zulikhan elikhadzhieva , a 20-year-old woman russian police say blew herself up in a suicide attack in moscow last week leaving 14 dead .
that attack served as a reminder to ordinary russians and the world that the conflict in chechnya is far from over .
russian security officials even warn of a brigade of 36 " black widows " - chechen women whose families have been killed in the war - prepared to sacrifice themselves in fresh terrorist attacks .
russian authorities say the thousands of refugees in ingushetia will all be home in chechnya before presidential elections in the republic - scheduled for 5 october .
but the mood among the refugees is pessimistic .
in another stall of the cowshed , ibragim , 29 , has breakfast with his two children , eight-year-old aisha , and dzhokar , 6 , under a cardboard roof .
he says he ca n't return to chechnya because he fears arrest and unlawful detention from russian police .
a short drive away , thousands more refugees take shelter from a summer rain storm in tents erected four years ago in the muddy fields .
like other chechens , ibragim fears arrest by russian police abdul khamid , returning to his tent after evening prayers in the camp mosque , scoffs at any idea of the war in chechnya being over .
" if you spent the night here , you 'd hear the explosions in the distance at night .
they say there 's no war , but how many people die every night ? " he asks .
people in the camps at first express outrage at the suicide bombs , but then some chechens try to put things in context .
" we muslims say that if you take your own life , you 'll never see paradise .
i do n't think any woman could do this , especially a 20-year-old girl , " says camp shopkeeper yesita yusupova .
" but maybe if they 've got nothing to lose ? "
hardening opinion makka khanchukayeva from grozny says her brother was arrested by russian forces and her elderly father , unable to deal with the shock , died from a heart attack .
for her , it 's possible to imagine why some women might resort to the worst .
" when young women in the prime of life blow themselves up , it 's terrible .
but they 've been driven to desperation .
" i do n't understand them , but on the other hand , i do understand .
their psyche 's been disturbed because their husbands , sons , brothers , sisters have been rounded up , " she says .
so far there 's no evidence of a severe crackdown in the refugee camps .
but human rights organisations fear outrage at the terrorist acts could lead to more and more arbitrary arrests of young chechen men .
surkho , a young man who did n't want to be photographed , has experienced the anger of russian security officials at first hand .
smoking a cigarette in his family 's tent , he admits to having been part of the rebel band of warlord ruslan gelayev and has only recently been released after a month 's detention in chechnya .
he 's seen the reality of the chechen conflict and warns that some may indeed be ready to sacrifice themselves and kill more innocent people .
the camp was erected four years ago " nobody will go and blow themselves up for no reason , but nearly 50 per cent of the people here are orphans .
what can a young girl do if they killed everyone in her family ?
" she 's left on her own .
so of course there 'll be a lot more of them . "
with opinion in the refugee camps of ingushetia hardening , aid agencies warn as well of another winter of hardship approaching .
" the situation is probably worse in ingushetia than a few years ago , " explains jonathan campbell of the world food programme .
" we 'd like to see people going home , but obviously the conditions have to be right .
" whether the conditions will be right by the elections in october remains to be seen . "

an elderly chechen woman standing nearby says the two brothers artur , 5 , and timur , 3 , have n't seen their father , dzhabrail tashukhadjiev in nine months .
dzhabrail , is another victim of the fourth year of conflict in chechnya .
and his two sons , now forced to live in a cattle shed in neighbouring ingushetia , are just one family of over 80,000 refugees unable to return home .
the family comes from the kurchaloi district of chechnya , as did zulikhan elikhadzhieva , a 20-year-old woman russian police say blew herself up in a suicide attack in moscow last week leaving 14 dead .
that attack served as a reminder to ordinary russians and the world that the conflict in chechnya is far from over .
russian security officials even warn of a brigade of 36 " black widows " - chechen women whose families have been killed in the war - prepared to sacrifice themselves in fresh terrorist attacks .
russian authorities say the thousands of refugees in ingushetia will all be home in chechnya before presidential elections in the republic - scheduled for 5 october .
but the mood among the refugees is pessimistic .
in another stall of the cowshed , ibragim , 29 , has breakfast with his two children , eight-year-old aisha , and dzhokar , 6 , under a cardboard roof .
he says he ca n't return to chechnya because he fears arrest and unlawful detention from russian police .
a short drive away , thousands more refugees take shelter from a summer rain storm in tents erected four years ago in the muddy fields .
like other chechens , ibragim fears arrest by russian police abdul khamid , returning to his tent after evening prayers in the camp mosque , scoffs at any idea of the war in chechnya being over .
" if you spent the night here , you 'd hear the explosions in the distance at night .
they say there 's no war , but how many people die every night ? " he asks .
people in the camps at first express outrage at the suicide bombs , but then some chechens try to put things in context .
" we muslims say that if you take your own life , you 'll never see paradise .
i do n't think any woman could do this , especially a 20-year-old girl , " says camp shopkeeper yesita yusupova .
" but maybe if they 've got nothing to lose ? "
hardening opinion makka khanchukayeva from grozny says her brother was arrested by russian forces and her elderly father , unable to deal with the shock , died from a heart attack .
for her , it 's possible to imagine why some women might resort to the worst .
" when young women in the prime of life blow themselves up , it 's terrible .
but they 've been driven to desperation .
" i do n't understand them , but on the other hand , i do understand .
their psyche 's been disturbed because their husbands , sons , brothers , sisters have been rounded up , " she says .
so far there 's no evidence of a severe crackdown in the refugee camps .
but human rights organisations fear outrage at the terrorist acts could lead to more and more arbitrary arrests of young chechen men .
surkho , a young man who did n't want to be photographed , has experienced the anger of russian security officials at first hand .
smoking a cigarette in his family 's tent , he admits to having been part of the rebel band of warlord ruslan gelayev and has only recently been released after a month 's detention in chechnya .
he 's seen the reality of the chechen conflict and warns that some may indeed be ready to sacrifice themselves and kill more innocent people .
the camp was erected four years ago " nobody will go and blow themselves up for no reason , but nearly 50 per cent of the people here are orphans .
what can a young girl do if they killed everyone in her family ?
" she 's left on her own .
so of course there 'll be a lot more of them . "
with opinion in the refugee camps of ingushetia hardening , aid agencies warn as well of another winter of hardship approaching .
" the situation is probably worse in ingushetia than a few years ago , " explains jonathan campbell of the world food programme .
" we 'd like to see people going home , but obviously the conditions have to be right .
" whether the conditions will be right by the elections in october remains to be seen . "

cordiant 's board has agreed to a tie-up with rival advertising group wpp , but shareholders are voting on the issue on wednesday .
active value , a uk investment fund which owns 28 % of cordiant , is reported to be gathering support for a concerted attempt to block wpp .
french advertising group publicis has admitted meeting active value on saturday to discuss a possible tie-up .
contact denied but the french company , which last month dropped out of the running for cordiant , said it was still not interested in making a full bid for the company .
it said it remained interested in its options regarding cordiant 's media buying arm zenith optimedia in which it has a 75 % stake .
" uk active value made a proposal regarding cordiant and cordiant 's shareholding in zenith optimedia group , which publicis declined , " publicis said in a statement .
" publicis confirms that it has no intention of making an offer for the shares of cordiant and that it remains interested solely in the cordiant assets to which publicis is linked by shareholding , by a brand belonging to publicis or through clients which have selected publicis . "
in a separate twist , a source close to the situation told the reuters news agency that another cordiant shareholder nahed ojjeh , a wealthy paris-based chess patron , increased her stake in the firm late on friday .
mrs ojjeh picked up a large block of about 775,000 shares and raising her 9.89 % stake to more than 10 % .
publicis has denied any contact with mrs ojjeh , as have active value .
investigation cordiant has an option to sell its 25 % stake in zenith to publicis at £ 75m but a change of control at cordiant could trigger a sale at a much lower price , based on 25 % of the cordiant equity .
industry watchers think active value and mrs ojjeh are seeking to take control of the struggling ad firm to help publicis buy zenith at a knock-down price .
in return , active value and other shareholders could share the savings publicis makes from buying zenith on the cheap .
the takeover panel is investigating whether the parties have been acting in concert .
