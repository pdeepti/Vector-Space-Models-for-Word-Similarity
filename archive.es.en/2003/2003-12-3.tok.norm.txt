the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .

what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .

however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .

news of their plight caught international attention , triggering an outpouring of sympathy . the 644 people arrived by plane in hanover on december 3 , 1978 .
they were among the 2,500 vietnamese boat people who had been given the chance to go to west germany .
the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .
" we know what kind of suffering lies behind you , and we feel with you , " he said .
" you have come to a country where you can live freely , without being oppressed by anyone .
you don ’ t need to be afraid , but instead can start your new life with courage and optimism . " not one of the newly-arrived spoke german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ship " cap anamur " rescued more than 8,000 vietnamese refugees in the 1970s .
the mass-exodus of so-called " boat people " began in the aftermath of the vietnam war , when more than one million vietnamese ended up in so-called “ re-education camps . ”
seventy percent of those seeking asylum belonged to the chinese minority in vietnam .
their traditional dominance in private enterprise did not tally with the communist regime ’ s vision .
many of the chinese fled to southern china .
others saw the only refugee boots as the only alternative . mixed reception germany took in a total of 35,000 refugees from southeast asia in 1978 and the subsequent years . while the boat people were greeted with sympathy in many places , there was also a good deal of disgruntlement .
the boat people were the first group of immigrants to come from outside of europe , and many people were skeptical about whether they would fit in .
a conservative politician in early 1979 even suggested they should be sent back to southeast asia , where the united nations and the forerunner of today 's european union should lease a stretch of land for them to live on . others , however , showed their willingness to help .
two cologne companies donated 1,000 airflights to bring the refugees to germany .
and in many cities , german families agreed to accommodate the vietnamese in their homes . the boat people 's plight also led to the foundation of one of germany 's best known relief organizations , cap anamur .
the group , established by christel und rupert neudeck , rescued boat people from turbulent waters , gave them medical care and sensitized german society to their plight .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german art basks in the glow of success the yearning for kraut art rent-a-painting leipzig , the art world 's new mecca art comes to aldi culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.12.2003 german art strikes a trendy note in the u.s. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in vogue - the exhibition " german art now " in st louis .
german politicians may be grappling with a loss of image in the u.s. since the dispute over the iraq war , but artists aren ’ t complaining as german art enjoys a popularity boom with americans . whether in new york or st. louis , german art is hip , happening and in demand .
never mind the political tensions between the two countries ever since german chancellor schröder decided to oppose the u.s.-led war against iraq earlier this year .
a look at the art calendar shows that german artists , both old and contemporary , are fast becoming fashionable on the american art landscape .
the new york-based neue galerie devoted to early 20th century german and austrian art and design recently celebrated its two-year anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german art now the exhibition " german art now " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which focuses on the international impact of german art in the second half of the 20th century and currently showing at the st. louis art museum , has been a success so far .
" the exhibition in st. louis has been a huge popular success and was even well received far beyond the city ’ s borders , " andrea firmenich , head of the cultural forum of german pharmaceuticals and chemicals group altana , which provided financial backing for the " german art now " exhibition , told dw-world .
and that ’ s not all .
another exhibition on german art at the beginning of the 20th century is on show at the busch-reisinger museum of the harvard university , while the vassar college in new york state is displaying works by renowned german sculptor käthe kollwitz .
art immune to political considerations " i believe , that public interest in german art has in fact increased in recent times , " dorothea dietrich , guest professor for 20th century art at the duke university said .
" earlier it was mainly french art that enjoyed attention in the u.s. , but now german art is increasingly become more important , " she said .
dietrich opined that the political dispute over the iraq war hasn ’ t had a negative impact on german art in the u.s.
" rather there was a negative fallout with relation to france . "
even anne wagner , professor for art history at the university of california in berkely and presently fellow at the american academy in berlin , agrees that the discord between u.s. and german politicians hasn ’ t spilled over onto the art scene .
" in my opinion , the political problems over the war in iraq had no implications for the reception of german art in the u.s. perhaps , it ’ s that art lovers tend to be less nationalistic than other people or maybe they think that art is not a direct reflection of politics , " she mused .
wagner points towards widely-acclaimed east german contemporary artist gerhard richter as a case in point .
" a good example of that is the gerhard richter exhibition in the u.s. last year , which was a huge success .
and no one was less interested in richter ’ s achievements because of the strained relations between germany and the u.s. , " she emphasized .
andrea firmenich of the atlanta group stressed that art could act as a bridge in the communication process between nations and could provide thought-provoking impulses .
" artists still speak to one another long after politicians have nothing more to say . "

german politicians may be grappling with a loss of image in the u.s. since the dispute over the iraq war , but artists aren ’ t complaining as german art enjoys a popularity boom with americans . whether in new york or st. louis , german art is hip , happening and in demand .
never mind the political tensions between the two countries ever since german chancellor schröder decided to oppose the u.s.-led war against iraq earlier this year .
a look at the art calendar shows that german artists , both old and contemporary , are fast becoming fashionable on the american art landscape .
the new york-based neue galerie devoted to early 20th century german and austrian art and design recently celebrated its two-year anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german art now the exhibition " german art now " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which focuses on the international impact of german art in the second half of the 20th century and currently showing at the st. louis art museum , has been a success so far .
" the exhibition in st. louis has been a huge popular success and was even well received far beyond the city ’ s borders , " andrea firmenich , head of the cultural forum of german pharmaceuticals and chemicals group altana , which provided financial backing for the " german art now " exhibition , told dw-world .
and that ’ s not all .
another exhibition on german art at the beginning of the 20th century is on show at the busch-reisinger museum of the harvard university , while the vassar college in new york state is displaying works by renowned german sculptor käthe kollwitz .
art immune to political considerations " i believe , that public interest in german art has in fact increased in recent times , " dorothea dietrich , guest professor for 20th century art at the duke university said .
" earlier it was mainly french art that enjoyed attention in the u.s. , but now german art is increasingly become more important , " she said .
dietrich opined that the political dispute over the iraq war hasn ’ t had a negative impact on german art in the u.s.
" rather there was a negative fallout with relation to france . "
even anne wagner , professor for art history at the university of california in berkely and presently fellow at the american academy in berlin , agrees that the discord between u.s. and german politicians hasn ’ t spilled over onto the art scene .
" in my opinion , the political problems over the war in iraq had no implications for the reception of german art in the u.s. perhaps , it ’ s that art lovers tend to be less nationalistic than other people or maybe they think that art is not a direct reflection of politics , " she mused .
wagner points towards widely-acclaimed east german contemporary artist gerhard richter as a case in point .
" a good example of that is the gerhard richter exhibition in the u.s. last year , which was a huge success .
and no one was less interested in richter ’ s achievements because of the strained relations between germany and the u.s. , " she emphasized .
andrea firmenich of the atlanta group stressed that art could act as a bridge in the communication process between nations and could provide thought-provoking impulses .

andrea firmenich of the atlanta group stressed that art could act as a bridge in the communication process between nations and could provide thought-provoking impulses .
" artists still speak to one another long after politicians have nothing more to say . "
firmenich added " german and american artists have always maintained a vigorous exchange and that ’ s happening again . "
" now more than ever " there are indications that the current surge in popularity for german art in the u.s. may not be a short-lived one .
" the opening of the neue galerie in new york provided an important push to the popularity of german art , " art professor dietrich explained .
even the atlanta cultural forum plans to continue with its engagement in the u.s. , independent of the political climate between germany and the u.s. firmenich emphasized that " now more than ever " is the motto in the art world ever since the german-american fallout over the iraq war . michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .
should the nuclear power really be supplied with european weapons ? at least , german business ca n't complain about gerhard schröder 's engagement when it comes to china .
during his visit there , the chancellor has tirelessly endeavored to open new doors and promote economic cooperation between the two countries .
and , above all , he has done it very adroitly and presented himself to his chinese interlocutors as a charismatic pragmatist with a strategic vision .
china 's government leaders like such movers and shakers - especially when they have predominantly pleasant messages to relay . which is why it 's clear that german businessmen and women will be grateful for the chancellor 's engagement in china , as will the german population presumably too .
for given germany 's crippled economy , everything has been well received that promised economic success .
and the people 's republic of china , with its 1.3 billion citizens , is an ideal venue for high-flying fantasies about capturing markets . but schröder overshoots the target when he assures his chinese partners that he will work within the eu to lift the european weapon embargo against beijing .
china is a different country than it was in 1989 when the students protests were violently suppressed - the chancellor is right about that .
the country is continually modernizing , and people profit from freedoms that were unthinkable just ten years ago on a daily basis . no significant progress in civil rights however , a brief glance at reports from human rights organizations like amnesty international could have demonstrated to schröder that in the sensitive area of civil rights beijing has still not made any significant progress .

but why on earth would he want to supply them to beijing ?

german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .
should the nuclear power really be supplied with european weapons ? at least , german business ca n't complain about gerhard schröder 's engagement when it comes to china .
during his visit there , the chancellor has tirelessly endeavored to open new doors and promote economic cooperation between the two countries .
and , above all , he has done it very adroitly and presented himself to his chinese interlocutors as a charismatic pragmatist with a strategic vision .
china 's government leaders like such movers and shakers - especially when they have predominantly pleasant messages to relay . which is why it 's clear that german businessmen and women will be grateful for the chancellor 's engagement in china , as will the german population presumably too .
for given germany 's crippled economy , everything has been well received that promised economic success .
and the people 's republic of china , with its 1.3 billion citizens , is an ideal venue for high-flying fantasies about capturing markets . but schröder overshoots the target when he assures his chinese partners that he will work within the eu to lift the european weapon embargo against beijing .
china is a different country than it was in 1989 when the students protests were violently suppressed - the chancellor is right about that .
the country is continually modernizing , and people profit from freedoms that were unthinkable just ten years ago on a daily basis . no significant progress in civil rights however , a brief glance at reports from human rights organizations like amnesty international could have demonstrated to schröder that in the sensitive area of civil rights beijing has still not made any significant progress .
there is still no freedom of political expression in china .
time and again there are politically-motivated arrests , most recently of internet dissidents .
and the death penalty still exists .
last year alone more than 1,000 people were sentenced to death . european weapons against taiwan ? schröder 's push for the weapons embargo to be lifted is questionable in a further regard : the people 's republic continues to view taiwan as a renegade province and threatens to respond to a declaration of independence on the part of the island with the force of arms . it is a relief that schröder does not want to begin supplying arms to taiwan , as he assured the chinese .
but why on earth would he want to supply them to beijing ?
it is incomprehensible that of all things european weapons should have to underpin china 's militaristic threats against taiwan . as if in justification , schröder said that the germans too know what it 's like to live in a divided country .
he must have misunderstood something .
there is one essential difference to the german situation : taiwan is by far more democratic today than the chinese mainland .
nor is it unimportant that west germany never tried to impose reunification with the force of arms . rainer sollich send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for end to arms embargo against china german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .

german government officials oppose this . eu funding could start as early as january , as a moratorium expires at the end of the year .
without a consensus in the eu council of ministers , individual funding requests will have to be approved by a two-thirds majority of member states .
" the commission will try to treat this issue wisely , " philippe busquin , the eu commissioner for research , said after wednesday ’ s meeting .
the german government immediately criticized possible eu funding for stem cell research .
" we expect that the eu commission will not end the moratorium and simply return to business as usual , " a german official told ap .
should funding commence , german tax payers would indirectly fund research that ’ s outlawed in their own country .
germany pushed for a moratorium pending the establishment of ethical guidelines .
eu research funds total € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- , around € 40 million of which could go towards scientists working with stem cells .
restrictions on research in germany german law only allows work on imported embryonic stem cells that have been harvested before jan .
2002 .
the cut-off date is meant to prevent the production of new embryos solely for the purpose of stem cell research .
research on embryonic stem cells is also only allowed under german law if no alternative exists , such as research animal stem cells or stem cells taken from adults .
because stem cells can develop into many different types of cells , they are unlike most other cells .
this makes them a valuable source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
proponents see the research as a way to fight diseases like parkinson ’ s or alzheimer ’ s diseases in the future .
eu commission more liberal eu research commissioner philippe busquin had planned more liberal guidelines to fund stem cell research and has proposed a june 2002 cut-off-date for embryonic cells that can be used .
just two weeks ago , the european parliament had voted to fund research on embryonic stem cells no more than 14 days old or those which were left over from fertility treatments .
with support from austria , italy and portugal , germany managed to avoid a vote in favor of the commission ’ s proposal last week .

saying that germany firmly supports china ’ s opposition to taiwan 's independence , chancellor gerhard schröder sided with beijing on wednesday as china threatened to invade taiwan in case of a referendum on independence . on the last day of a three-day visit to china , german chancellor schröder said he shared the country 's communist leadership ’ s views on a united china .
“ i believe that china is one country and has to remain as such , ” the chancellor told students in southern china ’ s canton province .
just like china had always supported german reunification , “ it goes without saying that we will do the same , ” schröder said .
“ one china ” separated since 1949 the german government has no formal diplomatic relations with taiwan .
according to the german foreign office ’ s web site , germany advocates that “ all questions concerning the relationship between china and taiwan be resolved peacefully " and calls upon the two sides to conduct a constructive dialogue on taiwan ’ s status and to refrain from using military means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taiwanese citizens have their own passports , but their country is not recognized by most nations around the world .
like germany , most countries do not recognize the island as an independent country although taiwan has been separated from mainland china since the 1949 civil war .
beijing views taiwan as a runaway province and is working toward reunification .
taiwanese leaders have said they won ’ t agree to that until china has a democratically elected government . referendum plans anger beijing recently , relations between bejing and taipei have been strained after the taiwanese parliament adopted a new law calling for a referendum on independence should china deploy its military might against the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ship explodes during a taiwanese military excercises in october .
chinese rulers view this as a step toward a taiwanese declaration of independence .
deputy foreign minister zhou wenzhong said taiwanese plans for a referendum and a new constitution represented the “ biggest challenge so far ” for beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy and stability in the region . just days before chinese premier wen jiabao is due to visit washington , d.c. , zhou called on the u.s. to stop supplying taiwan with weapons .
while the u.s. doesn ’ t recognize taiwan , it functions as the island ’ s main arms supplier . schröder calls on china to end internet censorship the german chancellor ’ s visit to china coincided with the release of three dissidents , who had been jailed for criticizing the government in the internet . while the germans welcomed the move , schröder called upon beijing to end its internet censorship .
china could only reach its goal of becoming the world ’ s largest internet market within the next four years if foreign and national internet users had free access to information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internet cafe in china .
not all web sites can be viewed as many are censored by the government .
beijing has an estimated 30,000 censors scanning web sites and blocking access to pages with content unfavorable to the regime .
according to the organization “ reporters without borders , ” 43 so-called cyber dissidents still remain in chinese prisons . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : schröder makes a questionable push for china german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2003 german cannibal trial opens in complexity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dilemma is not whether meiwes is guilty or not but with what charge to apply in the case .
the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .
court will view video extracts the court in kassel will be shown extracts of the video meiwes made of the killing but only of dialogue between perpetrator and victim which highlights the agreement between them .
the court will also hear the testimony of a british respondent to a previous advert placed by meiwes who avoided a similar fate by changing his mind and leaving when he realized the cannibal ’ s intent was real . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

german politicians may be grappling with a loss of image in the u.s. since the dispute over the iraq war , but artists aren ’ t complaining as german art enjoys a popularity boom with americans . whether in new york or st. louis , german art is hip , happening and in demand .
never mind the political tensions between the two countries ever since german chancellor schröder decided to oppose the u.s.-led war against iraq earlier this year .
a look at the art calendar shows that german artists , both old and contemporary , are fast becoming fashionable on the american art landscape .
the new york-based neue galerie devoted to early 20th century german and austrian art and design recently celebrated its two-year anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german art now the exhibition " german art now " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which focuses on the international impact of german art in the second half of the 20th century and currently showing at the st. louis art museum , has been a success so far .
" the exhibition in st. louis has been a huge popular success and was even well received far beyond the city ’ s borders , " andrea firmenich , head of the cultural forum of german pharmaceuticals and chemicals group altana , which provided financial backing for the " german art now " exhibition , told dw-world .
and that ’ s not all .
another exhibition on german art at the beginning of the 20th century is on show at the busch-reisinger museum of the harvard university , while the vassar college in new york state is displaying works by renowned german sculptor käthe kollwitz .
art immune to political considerations " i believe , that public interest in german art has in fact increased in recent times , " dorothea dietrich , guest professor for 20th century art at the duke university said .
" earlier it was mainly french art that enjoyed attention in the u.s. , but now german art is increasingly become more important , " she said .
dietrich opined that the political dispute over the iraq war hasn ’ t had a negative impact on german art in the u.s.
" rather there was a negative fallout with relation to france . "
even anne wagner , professor for art history at the university of california in berkely and presently fellow at the american academy in berlin , agrees that the discord between u.s. and german politicians hasn ’ t spilled over onto the art scene .
" in my opinion , the political problems over the war in iraq had no implications for the reception of german art in the u.s. perhaps , it ’ s that art lovers tend to be less nationalistic than other people or maybe they think that art is not a direct reflection of politics , " she mused .
wagner points towards widely-acclaimed east german contemporary artist gerhard richter as a case in point .
" a good example of that is the gerhard richter exhibition in the u.s. last year , which was a huge success .
and no one was less interested in richter ’ s achievements because of the strained relations between germany and the u.s. , " she emphasized .
andrea firmenich of the atlanta group stressed that art could act as a bridge in the communication process between nations and could provide thought-provoking impulses .
" artists still speak to one another long after politicians have nothing more to say . "
firmenich added " german and american artists have always maintained a vigorous exchange and that ’ s happening again . "
" now more than ever " there are indications that the current surge in popularity for german art in the u.s. may not be a short-lived one .
" the opening of the neue galerie in new york provided an important push to the popularity of german art , " art professor dietrich explained .
even the atlanta cultural forum plans to continue with its engagement in the u.s. , independent of the political climate between germany and the u.s. firmenich emphasized that " now more than ever " is the motto in the art world ever since the german-american fallout over the iraq war . michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-tv europe live journal we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2003 -pipe- 16:00 utc german president pardons former raf terrorist german president johannes rau has pardoned a former member of the notorious and now disbanded terrorist outfit raf -lrb- red army faction -rrb- , his office confirmed on wednesday .
rolf clemens wagner , who has spent the last 24 years in jail for being involved in the murder of german employers ’ association president hanns martin schleyer among other crimes , is expected to walk free on december 10 .
59-year-old wagner was arrested in november 1979 in zurich after a bank robbery after he shot dead a women and injured several others during his escape .

following the cancellation of a planned magnetic railway route in north-rhine westphalia , transport experts say there 's not enough in-country demand to keep the technology from going to the chinese eventually .
the joint project between thyssenkrupp and siemens employed 600 people in germany at its high point .
now , the head of the factory said the majority of his employees will have to work reduced hours because of a lack of demand .

the reform proposals , presented by cdu leader angela merkel , include delinking the funding of health and nursing care services from germany ’ s high non-wage labor costs , simplifying the existing tax system and replacing the income-related health insurance contributions with flat-rate health premiums of around € 200 a month .
analysts point out that the successful conference also helped cement merkel ’ s position within the party after she tenaciously pushed through with what were originally seen as widely unpopular reforms .
however german finance minister hans eichel of the ruling social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- sharply criticized the cdu ’ s radical tax reforms on wednesday and said that chances of a cross-party compromise on an early implementation of key tax reforms now seemed slim .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2003 german cannibal trial opens in complexity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dilemma is not whether meiwes is guilty or not but with what charge to apply in the case .
the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .
court will view video extracts the court in kassel will be shown extracts of the video meiwes made of the killing but only of dialogue between perpetrator and victim which highlights the agreement between them .
the court will also hear the testimony of a british respondent to a previous advert placed by meiwes who avoided a similar fate by changing his mind and leaving when he realized the cannibal ’ s intent was real . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

the deed was allegedly recorded on video .

the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .

i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .
court will view video extracts the court in kassel will be shown extracts of the video meiwes made of the killing but only of dialogue between perpetrator and victim which highlights the agreement between them .
the court will also hear the testimony of a british respondent to a previous advert placed by meiwes who avoided a similar fate by changing his mind and leaving when he realized the cannibal ’ s intent was real . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

news of their plight caught international attention , triggering an outpouring of sympathy . the 644 people arrived by plane in hanover on december 3 , 1978 .
they were among the 2,500 vietnamese boat people who had been given the chance to go to west germany .
the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .
" we know what kind of suffering lies behind you , and we feel with you , " he said .
" you have come to a country where you can live freely , without being oppressed by anyone .
you don ’ t need to be afraid , but instead can start your new life with courage and optimism . " not one of the newly-arrived spoke german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ship " cap anamur " rescued more than 8,000 vietnamese refugees in the 1970s .
the mass-exodus of so-called " boat people " began in the aftermath of the vietnam war , when more than one million vietnamese ended up in so-called “ re-education camps . ”
seventy percent of those seeking asylum belonged to the chinese minority in vietnam .
their traditional dominance in private enterprise did not tally with the communist regime ’ s vision .
many of the chinese fled to southern china .
others saw the only refugee boots as the only alternative . mixed reception germany took in a total of 35,000 refugees from southeast asia in 1978 and the subsequent years . while the boat people were greeted with sympathy in many places , there was also a good deal of disgruntlement .
the boat people were the first group of immigrants to come from outside of europe , and many people were skeptical about whether they would fit in .
a conservative politician in early 1979 even suggested they should be sent back to southeast asia , where the united nations and the forerunner of today 's european union should lease a stretch of land for them to live on . others , however , showed their willingness to help .
two cologne companies donated 1,000 airflights to bring the refugees to germany .
and in many cities , german families agreed to accommodate the vietnamese in their homes . the boat people 's plight also led to the foundation of one of germany 's best known relief organizations , cap anamur .

news of their plight caught international attention , triggering an outpouring of sympathy . the 644 people arrived by plane in hanover on december 3 , 1978 .
they were among the 2,500 vietnamese boat people who had been given the chance to go to west germany .
the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .
" we know what kind of suffering lies behind you , and we feel with you , " he said .

the mass-exodus of so-called " boat people " began in the aftermath of the vietnam war , when more than one million vietnamese ended up in so-called “ re-education camps . ”
seventy percent of those seeking asylum belonged to the chinese minority in vietnam .
their traditional dominance in private enterprise did not tally with the communist regime ’ s vision .
many of the chinese fled to southern china .
others saw the only refugee boots as the only alternative . mixed reception germany took in a total of 35,000 refugees from southeast asia in 1978 and the subsequent years . while the boat people were greeted with sympathy in many places , there was also a good deal of disgruntlement .
the boat people were the first group of immigrants to come from outside of europe , and many people were skeptical about whether they would fit in .
a conservative politician in early 1979 even suggested they should be sent back to southeast asia , where the united nations and the forerunner of today 's european union should lease a stretch of land for them to live on . others , however , showed their willingness to help .
two cologne companies donated 1,000 airflights to bring the refugees to germany .

german government officials oppose this . eu funding could start as early as january , as a moratorium expires at the end of the year .
without a consensus in the eu council of ministers , individual funding requests will have to be approved by a two-thirds majority of member states .
" the commission will try to treat this issue wisely , " philippe busquin , the eu commissioner for research , said after wednesday ’ s meeting .
the german government immediately criticized possible eu funding for stem cell research .
" we expect that the eu commission will not end the moratorium and simply return to business as usual , " a german official told ap .
should funding commence , german tax payers would indirectly fund research that ’ s outlawed in their own country .
germany pushed for a moratorium pending the establishment of ethical guidelines .
eu research funds total € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- , around € 40 million of which could go towards scientists working with stem cells .
restrictions on research in germany german law only allows work on imported embryonic stem cells that have been harvested before jan .
2002 .
the cut-off date is meant to prevent the production of new embryos solely for the purpose of stem cell research .
research on embryonic stem cells is also only allowed under german law if no alternative exists , such as research animal stem cells or stem cells taken from adults .
because stem cells can develop into many different types of cells , they are unlike most other cells .
this makes them a valuable source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
proponents see the research as a way to fight diseases like parkinson ’ s or alzheimer ’ s diseases in the future .
eu commission more liberal eu research commissioner philippe busquin had planned more liberal guidelines to fund stem cell research and has proposed a june 2002 cut-off-date for embryonic cells that can be used .
just two weeks ago , the european parliament had voted to fund research on embryonic stem cells no more than 14 days old or those which were left over from fertility treatments .
with support from austria , italy and portugal , germany managed to avoid a vote in favor of the commission ’ s proposal last week .
will eu ministers continue discussions ?
german government officials said they expected negotiations on the issue to continue in 2004 , when ireland takes over the rotating eu presidency .
but busquin countered that the irish would not revive the topic .

german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .
should the nuclear power really be supplied with european weapons ? at least , german business ca n't complain about gerhard schröder 's engagement when it comes to china .
during his visit there , the chancellor has tirelessly endeavored to open new doors and promote economic cooperation between the two countries .
and , above all , he has done it very adroitly and presented himself to his chinese interlocutors as a charismatic pragmatist with a strategic vision .
china 's government leaders like such movers and shakers - especially when they have predominantly pleasant messages to relay . which is why it 's clear that german businessmen and women will be grateful for the chancellor 's engagement in china , as will the german population presumably too .
for given germany 's crippled economy , everything has been well received that promised economic success .
and the people 's republic of china , with its 1.3 billion citizens , is an ideal venue for high-flying fantasies about capturing markets . but schröder overshoots the target when he assures his chinese partners that he will work within the eu to lift the european weapon embargo against beijing .
china is a different country than it was in 1989 when the students protests were violently suppressed - the chancellor is right about that .
the country is continually modernizing , and people profit from freedoms that were unthinkable just ten years ago on a daily basis . no significant progress in civil rights however , a brief glance at reports from human rights organizations like amnesty international could have demonstrated to schröder that in the sensitive area of civil rights beijing has still not made any significant progress .
there is still no freedom of political expression in china .
time and again there are politically-motivated arrests , most recently of internet dissidents .
and the death penalty still exists .
last year alone more than 1,000 people were sentenced to death . european weapons against taiwan ? schröder 's push for the weapons embargo to be lifted is questionable in a further regard : the people 's republic continues to view taiwan as a renegade province and threatens to respond to a declaration of independence on the part of the island with the force of arms . it is a relief that schröder does not want to begin supplying arms to taiwan , as he assured the chinese .
but why on earth would he want to supply them to beijing ?
it is incomprehensible that of all things european weapons should have to underpin china 's militaristic threats against taiwan . as if in justification , schröder said that the germans too know what it 's like to live in a divided country .
he must have misunderstood something .
there is one essential difference to the german situation : taiwan is by far more democratic today than the chinese mainland .

german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .
should the nuclear power really be supplied with european weapons ? at least , german business ca n't complain about gerhard schröder 's engagement when it comes to china .
during his visit there , the chancellor has tirelessly endeavored to open new doors and promote economic cooperation between the two countries .
and , above all , he has done it very adroitly and presented himself to his chinese interlocutors as a charismatic pragmatist with a strategic vision .
china 's government leaders like such movers and shakers - especially when they have predominantly pleasant messages to relay . which is why it 's clear that german businessmen and women will be grateful for the chancellor 's engagement in china , as will the german population presumably too .

and the people 's republic of china , with its 1.3 billion citizens , is an ideal venue for high-flying fantasies about capturing markets . but schröder overshoots the target when he assures his chinese partners that he will work within the eu to lift the european weapon embargo against beijing .
china is a different country than it was in 1989 when the students protests were violently suppressed - the chancellor is right about that .
the country is continually modernizing , and people profit from freedoms that were unthinkable just ten years ago on a daily basis . no significant progress in civil rights however , a brief glance at reports from human rights organizations like amnesty international could have demonstrated to schröder that in the sensitive area of civil rights beijing has still not made any significant progress .
there is still no freedom of political expression in china .

but why on earth would he want to supply them to beijing ?
it is incomprehensible that of all things european weapons should have to underpin china 's militaristic threats against taiwan . as if in justification , schröder said that the germans too know what it 's like to live in a divided country .

china is a different country than it was in 1989 when the students protests were violently suppressed - the chancellor is right about that .
the country is continually modernizing , and people profit from freedoms that were unthinkable just ten years ago on a daily basis . no significant progress in civil rights however , a brief glance at reports from human rights organizations like amnesty international could have demonstrated to schröder that in the sensitive area of civil rights beijing has still not made any significant progress .
there is still no freedom of political expression in china .
time and again there are politically-motivated arrests , most recently of internet dissidents .
and the death penalty still exists .
last year alone more than 1,000 people were sentenced to death . european weapons against taiwan ? schröder 's push for the weapons embargo to be lifted is questionable in a further regard : the people 's republic continues to view taiwan as a renegade province and threatens to respond to a declaration of independence on the part of the island with the force of arms . it is a relief that schröder does not want to begin supplying arms to taiwan , as he assured the chinese .
but why on earth would he want to supply them to beijing ?
it is incomprehensible that of all things european weapons should have to underpin china 's militaristic threats against taiwan . as if in justification , schröder said that the germans too know what it 's like to live in a divided country .
he must have misunderstood something .
there is one essential difference to the german situation : taiwan is by far more democratic today than the chinese mainland .
nor is it unimportant that west germany never tried to impose reunification with the force of arms . rainer sollich send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for end to arms embargo against china german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .

" the exhibition in st. louis has been a huge popular success and was even well received far beyond the city ’ s borders , " andrea firmenich , head of the cultural forum of german pharmaceuticals and chemicals group altana , which provided financial backing for the " german art now " exhibition , told dw-world .

art immune to political considerations " i believe , that public interest in german art has in fact increased in recent times , " dorothea dietrich , guest professor for 20th century art at the duke university said .
" earlier it was mainly french art that enjoyed attention in the u.s. , but now german art is increasingly become more important , " she said .

wagner points towards widely-acclaimed east german contemporary artist gerhard richter as a case in point .
" a good example of that is the gerhard richter exhibition in the u.s. last year , which was a huge success .
and no one was less interested in richter ’ s achievements because of the strained relations between germany and the u.s. , " she emphasized .
andrea firmenich of the atlanta group stressed that art could act as a bridge in the communication process between nations and could provide thought-provoking impulses .
" artists still speak to one another long after politicians have nothing more to say . "

news of their plight caught international attention , triggering an outpouring of sympathy . the 644 people arrived by plane in hanover on december 3 , 1978 .
they were among the 2,500 vietnamese boat people who had been given the chance to go to west germany .
the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .
" we know what kind of suffering lies behind you , and we feel with you , " he said .
" you have come to a country where you can live freely , without being oppressed by anyone .

the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .
" we know what kind of suffering lies behind you , and we feel with you , " he said .
" you have come to a country where you can live freely , without being oppressed by anyone .
you don ’ t need to be afraid , but instead can start your new life with courage and optimism . " not one of the newly-arrived spoke german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ship " cap anamur " rescued more than 8,000 vietnamese refugees in the 1970s .
the mass-exodus of so-called " boat people " began in the aftermath of the vietnam war , when more than one million vietnamese ended up in so-called “ re-education camps . ”
seventy percent of those seeking asylum belonged to the chinese minority in vietnam .
their traditional dominance in private enterprise did not tally with the communist regime ’ s vision .
many of the chinese fled to southern china .
others saw the only refugee boots as the only alternative . mixed reception germany took in a total of 35,000 refugees from southeast asia in 1978 and the subsequent years . while the boat people were greeted with sympathy in many places , there was also a good deal of disgruntlement .
the boat people were the first group of immigrants to come from outside of europe , and many people were skeptical about whether they would fit in .
a conservative politician in early 1979 even suggested they should be sent back to southeast asia , where the united nations and the forerunner of today 's european union should lease a stretch of land for them to live on . others , however , showed their willingness to help .
two cologne companies donated 1,000 airflights to bring the refugees to germany .
and in many cities , german families agreed to accommodate the vietnamese in their homes . the boat people 's plight also led to the foundation of one of germany 's best known relief organizations , cap anamur .
the group , established by christel und rupert neudeck , rescued boat people from turbulent waters , gave them medical care and sensitized german society to their plight .
cap anamur has projects today in war and crisis regions throughout the world , including afghanistan , iraq and chechnya . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world users help afghanistan the dreadful state of affairs in afghanistan seems to have been forgotten , unlike the reconstruction of iraq , which is currently in the news .

" the exhibition in st. louis has been a huge popular success and was even well received far beyond the city ’ s borders , " andrea firmenich , head of the cultural forum of german pharmaceuticals and chemicals group altana , which provided financial backing for the " german art now " exhibition , told dw-world .
and that ’ s not all .
another exhibition on german art at the beginning of the 20th century is on show at the busch-reisinger museum of the harvard university , while the vassar college in new york state is displaying works by renowned german sculptor käthe kollwitz .
art immune to political considerations " i believe , that public interest in german art has in fact increased in recent times , " dorothea dietrich , guest professor for 20th century art at the duke university said .
" earlier it was mainly french art that enjoyed attention in the u.s. , but now german art is increasingly become more important , " she said .
dietrich opined that the political dispute over the iraq war hasn ’ t had a negative impact on german art in the u.s.
" rather there was a negative fallout with relation to france . "
even anne wagner , professor for art history at the university of california in berkely and presently fellow at the american academy in berlin , agrees that the discord between u.s. and german politicians hasn ’ t spilled over onto the art scene .
" in my opinion , the political problems over the war in iraq had no implications for the reception of german art in the u.s. perhaps , it ’ s that art lovers tend to be less nationalistic than other people or maybe they think that art is not a direct reflection of politics , " she mused .
wagner points towards widely-acclaimed east german contemporary artist gerhard richter as a case in point .
" a good example of that is the gerhard richter exhibition in the u.s. last year , which was a huge success .
and no one was less interested in richter ’ s achievements because of the strained relations between germany and the u.s. , " she emphasized .
andrea firmenich of the atlanta group stressed that art could act as a bridge in the communication process between nations and could provide thought-provoking impulses .
" artists still speak to one another long after politicians have nothing more to say . "
firmenich added " german and american artists have always maintained a vigorous exchange and that ’ s happening again . "
" now more than ever " there are indications that the current surge in popularity for german art in the u.s. may not be a short-lived one .
" the opening of the neue galerie in new york provided an important push to the popularity of german art , " art professor dietrich explained .

german politicians may be grappling with a loss of image in the u.s. since the dispute over the iraq war , but artists aren ’ t complaining as german art enjoys a popularity boom with americans . whether in new york or st. louis , german art is hip , happening and in demand .
never mind the political tensions between the two countries ever since german chancellor schröder decided to oppose the u.s.-led war against iraq earlier this year .
a look at the art calendar shows that german artists , both old and contemporary , are fast becoming fashionable on the american art landscape .
the new york-based neue galerie devoted to early 20th century german and austrian art and design recently celebrated its two-year anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german art now the exhibition " german art now " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which focuses on the international impact of german art in the second half of the 20th century and currently showing at the st. louis art museum , has been a success so far .
" the exhibition in st. louis has been a huge popular success and was even well received far beyond the city ’ s borders , " andrea firmenich , head of the cultural forum of german pharmaceuticals and chemicals group altana , which provided financial backing for the " german art now " exhibition , told dw-world .
and that ’ s not all .
another exhibition on german art at the beginning of the 20th century is on show at the busch-reisinger museum of the harvard university , while the vassar college in new york state is displaying works by renowned german sculptor käthe kollwitz .
art immune to political considerations " i believe , that public interest in german art has in fact increased in recent times , " dorothea dietrich , guest professor for 20th century art at the duke university said .
" earlier it was mainly french art that enjoyed attention in the u.s. , but now german art is increasingly become more important , " she said .
dietrich opined that the political dispute over the iraq war hasn ’ t had a negative impact on german art in the u.s.
" rather there was a negative fallout with relation to france . "
even anne wagner , professor for art history at the university of california in berkely and presently fellow at the american academy in berlin , agrees that the discord between u.s. and german politicians hasn ’ t spilled over onto the art scene .
" in my opinion , the political problems over the war in iraq had no implications for the reception of german art in the u.s. perhaps , it ’ s that art lovers tend to be less nationalistic than other people or maybe they think that art is not a direct reflection of politics , " she mused .
wagner points towards widely-acclaimed east german contemporary artist gerhard richter as a case in point .
" a good example of that is the gerhard richter exhibition in the u.s. last year , which was a huge success .
and no one was less interested in richter ’ s achievements because of the strained relations between germany and the u.s. , " she emphasized .
andrea firmenich of the atlanta group stressed that art could act as a bridge in the communication process between nations and could provide thought-provoking impulses .
" artists still speak to one another long after politicians have nothing more to say . "
firmenich added " german and american artists have always maintained a vigorous exchange and that ’ s happening again . "
" now more than ever " there are indications that the current surge in popularity for german art in the u.s. may not be a short-lived one .
" the opening of the neue galerie in new york provided an important push to the popularity of german art , " art professor dietrich explained .
even the atlanta cultural forum plans to continue with its engagement in the u.s. , independent of the political climate between germany and the u.s. firmenich emphasized that " now more than ever " is the motto in the art world ever since the german-american fallout over the iraq war . michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 dw-tv europe live quadriga we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

taiwanese leaders have said they won ’ t agree to that until china has a democratically elected government . referendum plans anger beijing recently , relations between bejing and taipei have been strained after the taiwanese parliament adopted a new law calling for a referendum on independence should china deploy its military might against the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ship explodes during a taiwanese military excercises in october .
chinese rulers view this as a step toward a taiwanese declaration of independence .

german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .
should the nuclear power really be supplied with european weapons ? at least , german business ca n't complain about gerhard schröder 's engagement when it comes to china .
during his visit there , the chancellor has tirelessly endeavored to open new doors and promote economic cooperation between the two countries .
and , above all , he has done it very adroitly and presented himself to his chinese interlocutors as a charismatic pragmatist with a strategic vision .
china 's government leaders like such movers and shakers - especially when they have predominantly pleasant messages to relay . which is why it 's clear that german businessmen and women will be grateful for the chancellor 's engagement in china , as will the german population presumably too .
for given germany 's crippled economy , everything has been well received that promised economic success .
and the people 's republic of china , with its 1.3 billion citizens , is an ideal venue for high-flying fantasies about capturing markets . but schröder overshoots the target when he assures his chinese partners that he will work within the eu to lift the european weapon embargo against beijing .
china is a different country than it was in 1989 when the students protests were violently suppressed - the chancellor is right about that .
the country is continually modernizing , and people profit from freedoms that were unthinkable just ten years ago on a daily basis . no significant progress in civil rights however , a brief glance at reports from human rights organizations like amnesty international could have demonstrated to schröder that in the sensitive area of civil rights beijing has still not made any significant progress .

but why on earth would he want to supply them to beijing ?

news of their plight caught international attention , triggering an outpouring of sympathy . the 644 people arrived by plane in hanover on december 3 , 1978 .
they were among the 2,500 vietnamese boat people who had been given the chance to go to west germany .
the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .
" we know what kind of suffering lies behind you , and we feel with you , " he said .
" you have come to a country where you can live freely , without being oppressed by anyone .
you don ’ t need to be afraid , but instead can start your new life with courage and optimism . " not one of the newly-arrived spoke german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ship " cap anamur " rescued more than 8,000 vietnamese refugees in the 1970s .
the mass-exodus of so-called " boat people " began in the aftermath of the vietnam war , when more than one million vietnamese ended up in so-called “ re-education camps . ”
seventy percent of those seeking asylum belonged to the chinese minority in vietnam .
their traditional dominance in private enterprise did not tally with the communist regime ’ s vision .
many of the chinese fled to southern china .
others saw the only refugee boots as the only alternative . mixed reception germany took in a total of 35,000 refugees from southeast asia in 1978 and the subsequent years . while the boat people were greeted with sympathy in many places , there was also a good deal of disgruntlement .
the boat people were the first group of immigrants to come from outside of europe , and many people were skeptical about whether they would fit in .
a conservative politician in early 1979 even suggested they should be sent back to southeast asia , where the united nations and the forerunner of today 's european union should lease a stretch of land for them to live on . others , however , showed their willingness to help .

news of their plight caught international attention , triggering an outpouring of sympathy . the 644 people arrived by plane in hanover on december 3 , 1978 .
they were among the 2,500 vietnamese boat people who had been given the chance to go to west germany .
the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .
" we know what kind of suffering lies behind you , and we feel with you , " he said .
" you have come to a country where you can live freely , without being oppressed by anyone .
you don ’ t need to be afraid , but instead can start your new life with courage and optimism . " not one of the newly-arrived spoke german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ship " cap anamur " rescued more than 8,000 vietnamese refugees in the 1970s .
the mass-exodus of so-called " boat people " began in the aftermath of the vietnam war , when more than one million vietnamese ended up in so-called “ re-education camps . ”
seventy percent of those seeking asylum belonged to the chinese minority in vietnam .
their traditional dominance in private enterprise did not tally with the communist regime ’ s vision .
many of the chinese fled to southern china .
others saw the only refugee boots as the only alternative . mixed reception germany took in a total of 35,000 refugees from southeast asia in 1978 and the subsequent years . while the boat people were greeted with sympathy in many places , there was also a good deal of disgruntlement .
the boat people were the first group of immigrants to come from outside of europe , and many people were skeptical about whether they would fit in .
a conservative politician in early 1979 even suggested they should be sent back to southeast asia , where the united nations and the forerunner of today 's european union should lease a stretch of land for them to live on . others , however , showed their willingness to help .
two cologne companies donated 1,000 airflights to bring the refugees to germany .
and in many cities , german families agreed to accommodate the vietnamese in their homes . the boat people 's plight also led to the foundation of one of germany 's best known relief organizations , cap anamur .

german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .
should the nuclear power really be supplied with european weapons ? at least , german business ca n't complain about gerhard schröder 's engagement when it comes to china .
during his visit there , the chancellor has tirelessly endeavored to open new doors and promote economic cooperation between the two countries .
and , above all , he has done it very adroitly and presented himself to his chinese interlocutors as a charismatic pragmatist with a strategic vision .
china 's government leaders like such movers and shakers - especially when they have predominantly pleasant messages to relay . which is why it 's clear that german businessmen and women will be grateful for the chancellor 's engagement in china , as will the german population presumably too .
for given germany 's crippled economy , everything has been well received that promised economic success .
and the people 's republic of china , with its 1.3 billion citizens , is an ideal venue for high-flying fantasies about capturing markets . but schröder overshoots the target when he assures his chinese partners that he will work within the eu to lift the european weapon embargo against beijing .
china is a different country than it was in 1989 when the students protests were violently suppressed - the chancellor is right about that .
the country is continually modernizing , and people profit from freedoms that were unthinkable just ten years ago on a daily basis . no significant progress in civil rights however , a brief glance at reports from human rights organizations like amnesty international could have demonstrated to schröder that in the sensitive area of civil rights beijing has still not made any significant progress .

but why on earth would he want to supply them to beijing ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : german art basks in the glow of success the yearning for kraut art rent-a-painting leipzig , the art world 's new mecca art comes to aldi culture & lifestyle -pipe- 03.12.2003 german art strikes a trendy note in the u.s. großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in vogue - the exhibition " german art now " in st louis .
german politicians may be grappling with a loss of image in the u.s. since the dispute over the iraq war , but artists aren ’ t complaining as german art enjoys a popularity boom with americans . whether in new york or st. louis , german art is hip , happening and in demand .
never mind the political tensions between the two countries ever since german chancellor schröder decided to oppose the u.s.-led war against iraq earlier this year .
a look at the art calendar shows that german artists , both old and contemporary , are fast becoming fashionable on the american art landscape .
the new york-based neue galerie devoted to early 20th century german and austrian art and design recently celebrated its two-year anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german art now the exhibition " german art now " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which focuses on the international impact of german art in the second half of the 20th century and currently showing at the st. louis art museum , has been a success so far .
" the exhibition in st. louis has been a huge popular success and was even well received far beyond the city ’ s borders , " andrea firmenich , head of the cultural forum of german pharmaceuticals and chemicals group altana , which provided financial backing for the " german art now " exhibition , told dw-world .
and that ’ s not all .
another exhibition on german art at the beginning of the 20th century is on show at the busch-reisinger museum of the harvard university , while the vassar college in new york state is displaying works by renowned german sculptor käthe kollwitz .
art immune to political considerations " i believe , that public interest in german art has in fact increased in recent times , " dorothea dietrich , guest professor for 20th century art at the duke university said .
" earlier it was mainly french art that enjoyed attention in the u.s. , but now german art is increasingly become more important , " she said .
dietrich opined that the political dispute over the iraq war hasn ’ t had a negative impact on german art in the u.s.
" rather there was a negative fallout with relation to france . "
even anne wagner , professor for art history at the university of california in berkely and presently fellow at the american academy in berlin , agrees that the discord between u.s. and german politicians hasn ’ t spilled over onto the art scene .
" in my opinion , the political problems over the war in iraq had no implications for the reception of german art in the u.s. perhaps , it ’ s that art lovers tend to be less nationalistic than other people or maybe they think that art is not a direct reflection of politics , " she mused .
wagner points towards widely-acclaimed east german contemporary artist gerhard richter as a case in point .
" a good example of that is the gerhard richter exhibition in the u.s. last year , which was a huge success .
and no one was less interested in richter ’ s achievements because of the strained relations between germany and the u.s. , " she emphasized .
andrea firmenich of the atlanta group stressed that art could act as a bridge in the communication process between nations and could provide thought-provoking impulses .
" artists still speak to one another long after politicians have nothing more to say . "
firmenich added " german and american artists have always maintained a vigorous exchange and that ’ s happening again . "

german politicians may be grappling with a loss of image in the u.s. since the dispute over the iraq war , but artists aren ’ t complaining as german art enjoys a popularity boom with americans . whether in new york or st. louis , german art is hip , happening and in demand .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german art now the exhibition " german art now " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which focuses on the international impact of german art in the second half of the 20th century and currently showing at the st. louis art museum , has been a success so far .
" the exhibition in st. louis has been a huge popular success and was even well received far beyond the city ’ s borders , " andrea firmenich , head of the cultural forum of german pharmaceuticals and chemicals group altana , which provided financial backing for the " german art now " exhibition , told dw-world .

another exhibition on german art at the beginning of the 20th century is on show at the busch-reisinger museum of the harvard university , while the vassar college in new york state is displaying works by renowned german sculptor käthe kollwitz .
art immune to political considerations " i believe , that public interest in german art has in fact increased in recent times , " dorothea dietrich , guest professor for 20th century art at the duke university said .
" earlier it was mainly french art that enjoyed attention in the u.s. , but now german art is increasingly become more important , " she said .

wagner points towards widely-acclaimed east german contemporary artist gerhard richter as a case in point .
" a good example of that is the gerhard richter exhibition in the u.s. last year , which was a huge success .
and no one was less interested in richter ’ s achievements because of the strained relations between germany and the u.s. , " she emphasized .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2003 german cannibal trial opens in complexity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dilemma is not whether meiwes is guilty or not but with what charge to apply in the case .
the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .
court will view video extracts the court in kassel will be shown extracts of the video meiwes made of the killing but only of dialogue between perpetrator and victim which highlights the agreement between them .
the court will also hear the testimony of a british respondent to a previous advert placed by meiwes who avoided a similar fate by changing his mind and leaving when he realized the cannibal ’ s intent was real . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2003 german cannibal trial opens in complexity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dilemma is not whether meiwes is guilty or not but with what charge to apply in the case .
the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .
court will view video extracts the court in kassel will be shown extracts of the video meiwes made of the killing but only of dialogue between perpetrator and victim which highlights the agreement between them .

news of their plight caught international attention , triggering an outpouring of sympathy . the 644 people arrived by plane in hanover on december 3 , 1978 .
they were among the 2,500 vietnamese boat people who had been given the chance to go to west germany .
the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .
" we know what kind of suffering lies behind you , and we feel with you , " he said .
" you have come to a country where you can live freely , without being oppressed by anyone .
you don ’ t need to be afraid , but instead can start your new life with courage and optimism . " not one of the newly-arrived spoke german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ship " cap anamur " rescued more than 8,000 vietnamese refugees in the 1970s .
the mass-exodus of so-called " boat people " began in the aftermath of the vietnam war , when more than one million vietnamese ended up in so-called “ re-education camps . ”
seventy percent of those seeking asylum belonged to the chinese minority in vietnam .
their traditional dominance in private enterprise did not tally with the communist regime ’ s vision .
many of the chinese fled to southern china .
others saw the only refugee boots as the only alternative . mixed reception germany took in a total of 35,000 refugees from southeast asia in 1978 and the subsequent years . while the boat people were greeted with sympathy in many places , there was also a good deal of disgruntlement .
the boat people were the first group of immigrants to come from outside of europe , and many people were skeptical about whether they would fit in .
a conservative politician in early 1979 even suggested they should be sent back to southeast asia , where the united nations and the forerunner of today 's european union should lease a stretch of land for them to live on . others , however , showed their willingness to help .
two cologne companies donated 1,000 airflights to bring the refugees to germany .
and in many cities , german families agreed to accommodate the vietnamese in their homes . the boat people 's plight also led to the foundation of one of germany 's best known relief organizations , cap anamur .
the group , established by christel und rupert neudeck , rescued boat people from turbulent waters , gave them medical care and sensitized german society to their plight .

german government officials oppose this . eu funding could start as early as january , as a moratorium expires at the end of the year .
without a consensus in the eu council of ministers , individual funding requests will have to be approved by a two-thirds majority of member states .
" the commission will try to treat this issue wisely , " philippe busquin , the eu commissioner for research , said after wednesday ’ s meeting .
the german government immediately criticized possible eu funding for stem cell research .
" we expect that the eu commission will not end the moratorium and simply return to business as usual , " a german official told ap .
should funding commence , german tax payers would indirectly fund research that ’ s outlawed in their own country .
germany pushed for a moratorium pending the establishment of ethical guidelines .
eu research funds total € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- , around € 40 million of which could go towards scientists working with stem cells .
restrictions on research in germany german law only allows work on imported embryonic stem cells that have been harvested before jan .
2002 .
the cut-off date is meant to prevent the production of new embryos solely for the purpose of stem cell research .
research on embryonic stem cells is also only allowed under german law if no alternative exists , such as research animal stem cells or stem cells taken from adults .
because stem cells can develop into many different types of cells , they are unlike most other cells .
this makes them a valuable source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
proponents see the research as a way to fight diseases like parkinson ’ s or alzheimer ’ s diseases in the future .
eu commission more liberal eu research commissioner philippe busquin had planned more liberal guidelines to fund stem cell research and has proposed a june 2002 cut-off-date for embryonic cells that can be used .
just two weeks ago , the european parliament had voted to fund research on embryonic stem cells no more than 14 days old or those which were left over from fertility treatments .
with support from austria , italy and portugal , germany managed to avoid a vote in favor of the commission ’ s proposal last week .
will eu ministers continue discussions ?
german government officials said they expected negotiations on the issue to continue in 2004 , when ireland takes over the rotating eu presidency .
but busquin countered that the irish would not revive the topic .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2003 german cannibal trial opens in complexity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dilemma is not whether meiwes is guilty or not but with what charge to apply in the case .
the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .
court will view video extracts the court in kassel will be shown extracts of the video meiwes made of the killing but only of dialogue between perpetrator and victim which highlights the agreement between them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2003 german cannibal trial opens in complexity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dilemma is not whether meiwes is guilty or not but with what charge to apply in the case .
the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .
court will view video extracts the court in kassel will be shown extracts of the video meiwes made of the killing but only of dialogue between perpetrator and victim which highlights the agreement between them .
the court will also hear the testimony of a british respondent to a previous advert placed by meiwes who avoided a similar fate by changing his mind and leaving when he realized the cannibal ’ s intent was real . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

news of their plight caught international attention , triggering an outpouring of sympathy . the 644 people arrived by plane in hanover on december 3 , 1978 .
they were among the 2,500 vietnamese boat people who had been given the chance to go to west germany .
the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .
" we know what kind of suffering lies behind you , and we feel with you , " he said .
" you have come to a country where you can live freely , without being oppressed by anyone .
you don ’ t need to be afraid , but instead can start your new life with courage and optimism . " not one of the newly-arrived spoke german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ship " cap anamur " rescued more than 8,000 vietnamese refugees in the 1970s .
the mass-exodus of so-called " boat people " began in the aftermath of the vietnam war , when more than one million vietnamese ended up in so-called “ re-education camps . ”
seventy percent of those seeking asylum belonged to the chinese minority in vietnam .
their traditional dominance in private enterprise did not tally with the communist regime ’ s vision .
many of the chinese fled to southern china .
others saw the only refugee boots as the only alternative . mixed reception germany took in a total of 35,000 refugees from southeast asia in 1978 and the subsequent years . while the boat people were greeted with sympathy in many places , there was also a good deal of disgruntlement .
the boat people were the first group of immigrants to come from outside of europe , and many people were skeptical about whether they would fit in .
a conservative politician in early 1979 even suggested they should be sent back to southeast asia , where the united nations and the forerunner of today 's european union should lease a stretch of land for them to live on . others , however , showed their willingness to help .
two cologne companies donated 1,000 airflights to bring the refugees to germany .
and in many cities , german families agreed to accommodate the vietnamese in their homes . the boat people 's plight also led to the foundation of one of germany 's best known relief organizations , cap anamur .
the group , established by christel und rupert neudeck , rescued boat people from turbulent waters , gave them medical care and sensitized german society to their plight .

saying that germany firmly supports china ’ s opposition to taiwan 's independence , chancellor gerhard schröder sided with beijing on wednesday as china threatened to invade taiwan in case of a referendum on independence . on the last day of a three-day visit to china , german chancellor schröder said he shared the country 's communist leadership ’ s views on a united china .
“ i believe that china is one country and has to remain as such , ” the chancellor told students in southern china ’ s canton province .
just like china had always supported german reunification , “ it goes without saying that we will do the same , ” schröder said .
“ one china ” separated since 1949 the german government has no formal diplomatic relations with taiwan .
according to the german foreign office ’ s web site , germany advocates that “ all questions concerning the relationship between china and taiwan be resolved peacefully " and calls upon the two sides to conduct a constructive dialogue on taiwan ’ s status and to refrain from using military means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taiwanese citizens have their own passports , but their country is not recognized by most nations around the world .
like germany , most countries do not recognize the island as an independent country although taiwan has been separated from mainland china since the 1949 civil war .
beijing views taiwan as a runaway province and is working toward reunification .
taiwanese leaders have said they won ’ t agree to that until china has a democratically elected government . referendum plans anger beijing recently , relations between bejing and taipei have been strained after the taiwanese parliament adopted a new law calling for a referendum on independence should china deploy its military might against the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ship explodes during a taiwanese military excercises in october .
chinese rulers view this as a step toward a taiwanese declaration of independence .
deputy foreign minister zhou wenzhong said taiwanese plans for a referendum and a new constitution represented the “ biggest challenge so far ” for beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy and stability in the region . just days before chinese premier wen jiabao is due to visit washington , d.c. , zhou called on the u.s. to stop supplying taiwan with weapons .
while the u.s. doesn ’ t recognize taiwan , it functions as the island ’ s main arms supplier . schröder calls on china to end internet censorship the german chancellor ’ s visit to china coincided with the release of three dissidents , who had been jailed for criticizing the government in the internet . while the germans welcomed the move , schröder called upon beijing to end its internet censorship .
china could only reach its goal of becoming the world ’ s largest internet market within the next four years if foreign and national internet users had free access to information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internet cafe in china .
not all web sites can be viewed as many are censored by the government .

german government officials oppose this . eu funding could start as early as january , as a moratorium expires at the end of the year .
without a consensus in the eu council of ministers , individual funding requests will have to be approved by a two-thirds majority of member states .
" the commission will try to treat this issue wisely , " philippe busquin , the eu commissioner for research , said after wednesday ’ s meeting .
the german government immediately criticized possible eu funding for stem cell research .
" we expect that the eu commission will not end the moratorium and simply return to business as usual , " a german official told ap .
should funding commence , german tax payers would indirectly fund research that ’ s outlawed in their own country .
germany pushed for a moratorium pending the establishment of ethical guidelines .
eu research funds total € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- , around € 40 million of which could go towards scientists working with stem cells .
restrictions on research in germany german law only allows work on imported embryonic stem cells that have been harvested before jan .
2002 .
the cut-off date is meant to prevent the production of new embryos solely for the purpose of stem cell research .
research on embryonic stem cells is also only allowed under german law if no alternative exists , such as research animal stem cells or stem cells taken from adults .
because stem cells can develop into many different types of cells , they are unlike most other cells .
this makes them a valuable source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
proponents see the research as a way to fight diseases like parkinson ’ s or alzheimer ’ s diseases in the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2003 german cannibal trial opens in complexity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dilemma is not whether meiwes is guilty or not but with what charge to apply in the case .
the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .
court will view video extracts the court in kassel will be shown extracts of the video meiwes made of the killing but only of dialogue between perpetrator and victim which highlights the agreement between them .
the court will also hear the testimony of a british respondent to a previous advert placed by meiwes who avoided a similar fate by changing his mind and leaving when he realized the cannibal ’ s intent was real . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .

saying that germany firmly supports china ’ s opposition to taiwan 's independence , chancellor gerhard schröder sided with beijing on wednesday as china threatened to invade taiwan in case of a referendum on independence . on the last day of a three-day visit to china , german chancellor schröder said he shared the country 's communist leadership ’ s views on a united china .
“ i believe that china is one country and has to remain as such , ” the chancellor told students in southern china ’ s canton province .
just like china had always supported german reunification , “ it goes without saying that we will do the same , ” schröder said .
“ one china ” separated since 1949 the german government has no formal diplomatic relations with taiwan .
according to the german foreign office ’ s web site , germany advocates that “ all questions concerning the relationship between china and taiwan be resolved peacefully " and calls upon the two sides to conduct a constructive dialogue on taiwan ’ s status and to refrain from using military means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taiwanese citizens have their own passports , but their country is not recognized by most nations around the world .
like germany , most countries do not recognize the island as an independent country although taiwan has been separated from mainland china since the 1949 civil war .
beijing views taiwan as a runaway province and is working toward reunification .
taiwanese leaders have said they won ’ t agree to that until china has a democratically elected government . referendum plans anger beijing recently , relations between bejing and taipei have been strained after the taiwanese parliament adopted a new law calling for a referendum on independence should china deploy its military might against the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ship explodes during a taiwanese military excercises in october .
chinese rulers view this as a step toward a taiwanese declaration of independence .
deputy foreign minister zhou wenzhong said taiwanese plans for a referendum and a new constitution represented the “ biggest challenge so far ” for beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy and stability in the region . just days before chinese premier wen jiabao is due to visit washington , d.c. , zhou called on the u.s. to stop supplying taiwan with weapons .
while the u.s. doesn ’ t recognize taiwan , it functions as the island ’ s main arms supplier . schröder calls on china to end internet censorship the german chancellor ’ s visit to china coincided with the release of three dissidents , who had been jailed for criticizing the government in the internet . while the germans welcomed the move , schröder called upon beijing to end its internet censorship .
china could only reach its goal of becoming the world ’ s largest internet market within the next four years if foreign and national internet users had free access to information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internet cafe in china .
not all web sites can be viewed as many are censored by the government .
beijing has an estimated 30,000 censors scanning web sites and blocking access to pages with content unfavorable to the regime .

news of their plight caught international attention , triggering an outpouring of sympathy . the 644 people arrived by plane in hanover on december 3 , 1978 .
they were among the 2,500 vietnamese boat people who had been given the chance to go to west germany .
the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .
" we know what kind of suffering lies behind you , and we feel with you , " he said .
" you have come to a country where you can live freely , without being oppressed by anyone .
you don ’ t need to be afraid , but instead can start your new life with courage and optimism . " not one of the newly-arrived spoke german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ship " cap anamur " rescued more than 8,000 vietnamese refugees in the 1970s .
the mass-exodus of so-called " boat people " began in the aftermath of the vietnam war , when more than one million vietnamese ended up in so-called “ re-education camps . ”
seventy percent of those seeking asylum belonged to the chinese minority in vietnam .

but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .
" we know what kind of suffering lies behind you , and we feel with you , " he said .
" you have come to a country where you can live freely , without being oppressed by anyone .
you don ’ t need to be afraid , but instead can start your new life with courage and optimism . " not one of the newly-arrived spoke german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ship " cap anamur " rescued more than 8,000 vietnamese refugees in the 1970s .
the mass-exodus of so-called " boat people " began in the aftermath of the vietnam war , when more than one million vietnamese ended up in so-called “ re-education camps . ”
seventy percent of those seeking asylum belonged to the chinese minority in vietnam .
their traditional dominance in private enterprise did not tally with the communist regime ’ s vision .
many of the chinese fled to southern china .
others saw the only refugee boots as the only alternative . mixed reception germany took in a total of 35,000 refugees from southeast asia in 1978 and the subsequent years . while the boat people were greeted with sympathy in many places , there was also a good deal of disgruntlement .
the boat people were the first group of immigrants to come from outside of europe , and many people were skeptical about whether they would fit in .
a conservative politician in early 1979 even suggested they should be sent back to southeast asia , where the united nations and the forerunner of today 's european union should lease a stretch of land for them to live on . others , however , showed their willingness to help .
two cologne companies donated 1,000 airflights to bring the refugees to germany .
and in many cities , german families agreed to accommodate the vietnamese in their homes . the boat people 's plight also led to the foundation of one of germany 's best known relief organizations , cap anamur .
the group , established by christel und rupert neudeck , rescued boat people from turbulent waters , gave them medical care and sensitized german society to their plight .

saying that germany firmly supports china ’ s opposition to taiwan 's independence , chancellor gerhard schröder sided with beijing on wednesday as china threatened to invade taiwan in case of a referendum on independence . on the last day of a three-day visit to china , german chancellor schröder said he shared the country 's communist leadership ’ s views on a united china .
“ i believe that china is one country and has to remain as such , ” the chancellor told students in southern china ’ s canton province .
just like china had always supported german reunification , “ it goes without saying that we will do the same , ” schröder said .
“ one china ” separated since 1949 the german government has no formal diplomatic relations with taiwan .
according to the german foreign office ’ s web site , germany advocates that “ all questions concerning the relationship between china and taiwan be resolved peacefully " and calls upon the two sides to conduct a constructive dialogue on taiwan ’ s status and to refrain from using military means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taiwanese citizens have their own passports , but their country is not recognized by most nations around the world .
like germany , most countries do not recognize the island as an independent country although taiwan has been separated from mainland china since the 1949 civil war .
beijing views taiwan as a runaway province and is working toward reunification .
taiwanese leaders have said they won ’ t agree to that until china has a democratically elected government . referendum plans anger beijing recently , relations between bejing and taipei have been strained after the taiwanese parliament adopted a new law calling for a referendum on independence should china deploy its military might against the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ship explodes during a taiwanese military excercises in october .

while the u.s. doesn ’ t recognize taiwan , it functions as the island ’ s main arms supplier . schröder calls on china to end internet censorship the german chancellor ’ s visit to china coincided with the release of three dissidents , who had been jailed for criticizing the government in the internet . while the germans welcomed the move , schröder called upon beijing to end its internet censorship .
china could only reach its goal of becoming the world ’ s largest internet market within the next four years if foreign and national internet users had free access to information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internet cafe in china .
not all web sites can be viewed as many are censored by the government .
beijing has an estimated 30,000 censors scanning web sites and blocking access to pages with content unfavorable to the regime .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german art now the exhibition " german art now " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which focuses on the international impact of german art in the second half of the 20th century and currently showing at the st. louis art museum , has been a success so far .
" the exhibition in st. louis has been a huge popular success and was even well received far beyond the city ’ s borders , " andrea firmenich , head of the cultural forum of german pharmaceuticals and chemicals group altana , which provided financial backing for the " german art now " exhibition , told dw-world .
and that ’ s not all .
another exhibition on german art at the beginning of the 20th century is on show at the busch-reisinger museum of the harvard university , while the vassar college in new york state is displaying works by renowned german sculptor käthe kollwitz .
art immune to political considerations " i believe , that public interest in german art has in fact increased in recent times , " dorothea dietrich , guest professor for 20th century art at the duke university said .
" earlier it was mainly french art that enjoyed attention in the u.s. , but now german art is increasingly become more important , " she said .
dietrich opined that the political dispute over the iraq war hasn ’ t had a negative impact on german art in the u.s.
" rather there was a negative fallout with relation to france . "
even anne wagner , professor for art history at the university of california in berkely and presently fellow at the american academy in berlin , agrees that the discord between u.s. and german politicians hasn ’ t spilled over onto the art scene .
" in my opinion , the political problems over the war in iraq had no implications for the reception of german art in the u.s. perhaps , it ’ s that art lovers tend to be less nationalistic than other people or maybe they think that art is not a direct reflection of politics , " she mused .
wagner points towards widely-acclaimed east german contemporary artist gerhard richter as a case in point .
" a good example of that is the gerhard richter exhibition in the u.s. last year , which was a huge success .
and no one was less interested in richter ’ s achievements because of the strained relations between germany and the u.s. , " she emphasized .
andrea firmenich of the atlanta group stressed that art could act as a bridge in the communication process between nations and could provide thought-provoking impulses .
" artists still speak to one another long after politicians have nothing more to say . "
firmenich added " german and american artists have always maintained a vigorous exchange and that ’ s happening again . "
" now more than ever " there are indications that the current surge in popularity for german art in the u.s. may not be a short-lived one .
" the opening of the neue galerie in new york provided an important push to the popularity of german art , " art professor dietrich explained .
even the atlanta cultural forum plans to continue with its engagement in the u.s. , independent of the political climate between germany and the u.s. firmenich emphasized that " now more than ever " is the motto in the art world ever since the german-american fallout over the iraq war . michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

news of their plight caught international attention , triggering an outpouring of sympathy . the 644 people arrived by plane in hanover on december 3 , 1978 .
they were among the 2,500 vietnamese boat people who had been given the chance to go to west germany .
the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .
" we know what kind of suffering lies behind you , and we feel with you , " he said .
" you have come to a country where you can live freely , without being oppressed by anyone .
you don ’ t need to be afraid , but instead can start your new life with courage and optimism . " not one of the newly-arrived spoke german . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ship " cap anamur " rescued more than 8,000 vietnamese refugees in the 1970s .
the mass-exodus of so-called " boat people " began in the aftermath of the vietnam war , when more than one million vietnamese ended up in so-called “ re-education camps . ”
seventy percent of those seeking asylum belonged to the chinese minority in vietnam .
their traditional dominance in private enterprise did not tally with the communist regime ’ s vision .
many of the chinese fled to southern china .
others saw the only refugee boots as the only alternative . mixed reception germany took in a total of 35,000 refugees from southeast asia in 1978 and the subsequent years . while the boat people were greeted with sympathy in many places , there was also a good deal of disgruntlement .
the boat people were the first group of immigrants to come from outside of europe , and many people were skeptical about whether they would fit in .
a conservative politician in early 1979 even suggested they should be sent back to southeast asia , where the united nations and the forerunner of today 's european union should lease a stretch of land for them to live on . others , however , showed their willingness to help .
two cologne companies donated 1,000 airflights to bring the refugees to germany .
and in many cities , german families agreed to accommodate the vietnamese in their homes . the boat people 's plight also led to the foundation of one of germany 's best known relief organizations , cap anamur .
the group , established by christel und rupert neudeck , rescued boat people from turbulent waters , gave them medical care and sensitized german society to their plight .

german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .
should the nuclear power really be supplied with european weapons ? at least , german business ca n't complain about gerhard schröder 's engagement when it comes to china .
during his visit there , the chancellor has tirelessly endeavored to open new doors and promote economic cooperation between the two countries .
and , above all , he has done it very adroitly and presented himself to his chinese interlocutors as a charismatic pragmatist with a strategic vision .

china is a different country than it was in 1989 when the students protests were violently suppressed - the chancellor is right about that .
the country is continually modernizing , and people profit from freedoms that were unthinkable just ten years ago on a daily basis . no significant progress in civil rights however , a brief glance at reports from human rights organizations like amnesty international could have demonstrated to schröder that in the sensitive area of civil rights beijing has still not made any significant progress .

but why on earth would he want to supply them to beijing ?

saying that germany firmly supports china ’ s opposition to taiwan 's independence , chancellor gerhard schröder sided with beijing on wednesday as china threatened to invade taiwan in case of a referendum on independence . on the last day of a three-day visit to china , german chancellor schröder said he shared the country 's communist leadership ’ s views on a united china .
“ i believe that china is one country and has to remain as such , ” the chancellor told students in southern china ’ s canton province .
just like china had always supported german reunification , “ it goes without saying that we will do the same , ” schröder said .
“ one china ” separated since 1949 the german government has no formal diplomatic relations with taiwan .
according to the german foreign office ’ s web site , germany advocates that “ all questions concerning the relationship between china and taiwan be resolved peacefully " and calls upon the two sides to conduct a constructive dialogue on taiwan ’ s status and to refrain from using military means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taiwanese citizens have their own passports , but their country is not recognized by most nations around the world .
like germany , most countries do not recognize the island as an independent country although taiwan has been separated from mainland china since the 1949 civil war .
beijing views taiwan as a runaway province and is working toward reunification .
taiwanese leaders have said they won ’ t agree to that until china has a democratically elected government . referendum plans anger beijing recently , relations between bejing and taipei have been strained after the taiwanese parliament adopted a new law calling for a referendum on independence should china deploy its military might against the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ship explodes during a taiwanese military excercises in october .
chinese rulers view this as a step toward a taiwanese declaration of independence .
deputy foreign minister zhou wenzhong said taiwanese plans for a referendum and a new constitution represented the “ biggest challenge so far ” for beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy and stability in the region . just days before chinese premier wen jiabao is due to visit washington , d.c. , zhou called on the u.s. to stop supplying taiwan with weapons .
while the u.s. doesn ’ t recognize taiwan , it functions as the island ’ s main arms supplier . schröder calls on china to end internet censorship the german chancellor ’ s visit to china coincided with the release of three dissidents , who had been jailed for criticizing the government in the internet . while the germans welcomed the move , schröder called upon beijing to end its internet censorship .
china could only reach its goal of becoming the world ’ s largest internet market within the next four years if foreign and national internet users had free access to information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internet cafe in china .
not all web sites can be viewed as many are censored by the government .
beijing has an estimated 30,000 censors scanning web sites and blocking access to pages with content unfavorable to the regime .
according to the organization “ reporters without borders , ” 43 so-called cyber dissidents still remain in chinese prisons . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : schröder makes a questionable push for china german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .

news of their plight caught international attention , triggering an outpouring of sympathy . the 644 people arrived by plane in hanover on december 3 , 1978 .
they were among the 2,500 vietnamese boat people who had been given the chance to go to west germany .
the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .
in an outpour of sympathy , west germany and some other western countries said they would take in the refugees . welcome to hanover shortly thereafter , the plane of vietnamese was greeted by ernst albrecht , the premier of lower saxony , in hanover .

the boat people were the first group of immigrants to come from outside of europe , and many people were skeptical about whether they would fit in .
a conservative politician in early 1979 even suggested they should be sent back to southeast asia , where the united nations and the forerunner of today 's european union should lease a stretch of land for them to live on . others , however , showed their willingness to help .
two cologne companies donated 1,000 airflights to bring the refugees to germany .

news of their plight caught international attention , triggering an outpouring of sympathy . the 644 people arrived by plane in hanover on december 3 , 1978 .
they were among the 2,500 vietnamese boat people who had been given the chance to go to west germany .
the 208 families had drawn the winning lots - and made up the largest group of refugees to ever come to germany from such a remote region . today the image of emaciated immigrants packed into a hardly seaworthy vessel has become an all too common sight in europe .
but 25 years ago the plight of the first boat people captured the attention of germany and motivated people here to undertake previously unheard of action to help the refugees . the boat people had braved a two-month-odyssey on an overcrowded craft in the south china sea to escape from communist rule at home .
but their boat , the hai hong , was unable to dock because no country in southeast asia wanted the survivors .
the neighboring countries were already harboring some 60,000 vietnamese refugees in camps and more were not welcome . the tide turned when television coverage of the living conditions on board the hai hong was broadcast throughout the world .

" the exhibition in st. louis has been a huge popular success and was even well received far beyond the city ’ s borders , " andrea firmenich , head of the cultural forum of german pharmaceuticals and chemicals group altana , which provided financial backing for the " german art now " exhibition , told dw-world .

another exhibition on german art at the beginning of the 20th century is on show at the busch-reisinger museum of the harvard university , while the vassar college in new york state is displaying works by renowned german sculptor käthe kollwitz .
art immune to political considerations " i believe , that public interest in german art has in fact increased in recent times , " dorothea dietrich , guest professor for 20th century art at the duke university said .
" earlier it was mainly french art that enjoyed attention in the u.s. , but now german art is increasingly become more important , " she said .

wagner points towards widely-acclaimed east german contemporary artist gerhard richter as a case in point .
" a good example of that is the gerhard richter exhibition in the u.s. last year , which was a huge success .
and no one was less interested in richter ’ s achievements because of the strained relations between germany and the u.s. , " she emphasized .
andrea firmenich of the atlanta group stressed that art could act as a bridge in the communication process between nations and could provide thought-provoking impulses .

a look at the art calendar shows that german artists , both old and contemporary , are fast becoming fashionable on the american art landscape .
the new york-based neue galerie devoted to early 20th century german and austrian art and design recently celebrated its two-year anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german art now the exhibition " german art now " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which focuses on the international impact of german art in the second half of the 20th century and currently showing at the st. louis art museum , has been a success so far .
" the exhibition in st. louis has been a huge popular success and was even well received far beyond the city ’ s borders , " andrea firmenich , head of the cultural forum of german pharmaceuticals and chemicals group altana , which provided financial backing for the " german art now " exhibition , told dw-world .
and that ’ s not all .
another exhibition on german art at the beginning of the 20th century is on show at the busch-reisinger museum of the harvard university , while the vassar college in new york state is displaying works by renowned german sculptor käthe kollwitz .
art immune to political considerations " i believe , that public interest in german art has in fact increased in recent times , " dorothea dietrich , guest professor for 20th century art at the duke university said .
" earlier it was mainly french art that enjoyed attention in the u.s. , but now german art is increasingly become more important , " she said .
dietrich opined that the political dispute over the iraq war hasn ’ t had a negative impact on german art in the u.s.
" rather there was a negative fallout with relation to france . "
even anne wagner , professor for art history at the university of california in berkely and presently fellow at the american academy in berlin , agrees that the discord between u.s. and german politicians hasn ’ t spilled over onto the art scene .
" in my opinion , the political problems over the war in iraq had no implications for the reception of german art in the u.s. perhaps , it ’ s that art lovers tend to be less nationalistic than other people or maybe they think that art is not a direct reflection of politics , " she mused .
wagner points towards widely-acclaimed east german contemporary artist gerhard richter as a case in point .
" a good example of that is the gerhard richter exhibition in the u.s. last year , which was a huge success .
and no one was less interested in richter ’ s achievements because of the strained relations between germany and the u.s. , " she emphasized .
andrea firmenich of the atlanta group stressed that art could act as a bridge in the communication process between nations and could provide thought-provoking impulses .
" artists still speak to one another long after politicians have nothing more to say . "
firmenich added " german and american artists have always maintained a vigorous exchange and that ’ s happening again . "
" now more than ever " there are indications that the current surge in popularity for german art in the u.s. may not be a short-lived one .
" the opening of the neue galerie in new york provided an important push to the popularity of german art , " art professor dietrich explained .
even the atlanta cultural forum plans to continue with its engagement in the u.s. , independent of the political climate between germany and the u.s. firmenich emphasized that " now more than ever " is the motto in the art world ever since the german-american fallout over the iraq war . michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 dw-tv europe live drive it !

german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .
should the nuclear power really be supplied with european weapons ? at least , german business ca n't complain about gerhard schröder 's engagement when it comes to china .
during his visit there , the chancellor has tirelessly endeavored to open new doors and promote economic cooperation between the two countries .
and , above all , he has done it very adroitly and presented himself to his chinese interlocutors as a charismatic pragmatist with a strategic vision .
china 's government leaders like such movers and shakers - especially when they have predominantly pleasant messages to relay . which is why it 's clear that german businessmen and women will be grateful for the chancellor 's engagement in china , as will the german population presumably too .
for given germany 's crippled economy , everything has been well received that promised economic success .
and the people 's republic of china , with its 1.3 billion citizens , is an ideal venue for high-flying fantasies about capturing markets . but schröder overshoots the target when he assures his chinese partners that he will work within the eu to lift the european weapon embargo against beijing .
china is a different country than it was in 1989 when the students protests were violently suppressed - the chancellor is right about that .
the country is continually modernizing , and people profit from freedoms that were unthinkable just ten years ago on a daily basis . no significant progress in civil rights however , a brief glance at reports from human rights organizations like amnesty international could have demonstrated to schröder that in the sensitive area of civil rights beijing has still not made any significant progress .
there is still no freedom of political expression in china .
time and again there are politically-motivated arrests , most recently of internet dissidents .
and the death penalty still exists .
last year alone more than 1,000 people were sentenced to death . european weapons against taiwan ? schröder 's push for the weapons embargo to be lifted is questionable in a further regard : the people 's republic continues to view taiwan as a renegade province and threatens to respond to a declaration of independence on the part of the island with the force of arms . it is a relief that schröder does not want to begin supplying arms to taiwan , as he assured the chinese .
but why on earth would he want to supply them to beijing ?
it is incomprehensible that of all things european weapons should have to underpin china 's militaristic threats against taiwan . as if in justification , schröder said that the germans too know what it 's like to live in a divided country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2003 german cannibal trial opens in complexity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dilemma is not whether meiwes is guilty or not but with what charge to apply in the case .
the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .
court will view video extracts the court in kassel will be shown extracts of the video meiwes made of the killing but only of dialogue between perpetrator and victim which highlights the agreement between them .
the court will also hear the testimony of a british respondent to a previous advert placed by meiwes who avoided a similar fate by changing his mind and leaving when he realized the cannibal ’ s intent was real . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .
court will view video extracts the court in kassel will be shown extracts of the video meiwes made of the killing but only of dialogue between perpetrator and victim which highlights the agreement between them .
the court will also hear the testimony of a british respondent to a previous advert placed by meiwes who avoided a similar fate by changing his mind and leaving when he realized the cannibal ’ s intent was real . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 03.12.2003 opinion : schröder makes a questionable push for china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german weapons and plutonium could be headed for china , if chancellor schröder has his way .
german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .
should the nuclear power really be supplied with european weapons ? at least , german business ca n't complain about gerhard schröder 's engagement when it comes to china .
during his visit there , the chancellor has tirelessly endeavored to open new doors and promote economic cooperation between the two countries .
and , above all , he has done it very adroitly and presented himself to his chinese interlocutors as a charismatic pragmatist with a strategic vision .
china 's government leaders like such movers and shakers - especially when they have predominantly pleasant messages to relay . which is why it 's clear that german businessmen and women will be grateful for the chancellor 's engagement in china , as will the german population presumably too .
for given germany 's crippled economy , everything has been well received that promised economic success .
and the people 's republic of china , with its 1.3 billion citizens , is an ideal venue for high-flying fantasies about capturing markets . but schröder overshoots the target when he assures his chinese partners that he will work within the eu to lift the european weapon embargo against beijing .
china is a different country than it was in 1989 when the students protests were violently suppressed - the chancellor is right about that .
the country is continually modernizing , and people profit from freedoms that were unthinkable just ten years ago on a daily basis . no significant progress in civil rights however , a brief glance at reports from human rights organizations like amnesty international could have demonstrated to schröder that in the sensitive area of civil rights beijing has still not made any significant progress .
there is still no freedom of political expression in china .
time and again there are politically-motivated arrests , most recently of internet dissidents .
and the death penalty still exists .
last year alone more than 1,000 people were sentenced to death . european weapons against taiwan ? schröder 's push for the weapons embargo to be lifted is questionable in a further regard : the people 's republic continues to view taiwan as a renegade province and threatens to respond to a declaration of independence on the part of the island with the force of arms . it is a relief that schröder does not want to begin supplying arms to taiwan , as he assured the chinese .
but why on earth would he want to supply them to beijing ?
it is incomprehensible that of all things european weapons should have to underpin china 's militaristic threats against taiwan . as if in justification , schröder said that the germans too know what it 's like to live in a divided country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2003 german cannibal trial opens in complexity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dilemma is not whether meiwes is guilty or not but with what charge to apply in the case .
the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .
court will view video extracts the court in kassel will be shown extracts of the video meiwes made of the killing but only of dialogue between perpetrator and victim which highlights the agreement between them .
the court will also hear the testimony of a british respondent to a previous advert placed by meiwes who avoided a similar fate by changing his mind and leaving when he realized the cannibal ’ s intent was real . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2003 german cannibal trial opens in complexity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dilemma is not whether meiwes is guilty or not but with what charge to apply in the case .
the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .

saying that germany firmly supports china ’ s opposition to taiwan 's independence , chancellor gerhard schröder sided with beijing on wednesday as china threatened to invade taiwan in case of a referendum on independence . on the last day of a three-day visit to china , german chancellor schröder said he shared the country 's communist leadership ’ s views on a united china .
“ i believe that china is one country and has to remain as such , ” the chancellor told students in southern china ’ s canton province .
just like china had always supported german reunification , “ it goes without saying that we will do the same , ” schröder said .
“ one china ” separated since 1949 the german government has no formal diplomatic relations with taiwan .
according to the german foreign office ’ s web site , germany advocates that “ all questions concerning the relationship between china and taiwan be resolved peacefully " and calls upon the two sides to conduct a constructive dialogue on taiwan ’ s status and to refrain from using military means . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : taiwanese citizens have their own passports , but their country is not recognized by most nations around the world .
like germany , most countries do not recognize the island as an independent country although taiwan has been separated from mainland china since the 1949 civil war .
beijing views taiwan as a runaway province and is working toward reunification .
taiwanese leaders have said they won ’ t agree to that until china has a democratically elected government . referendum plans anger beijing recently , relations between bejing and taipei have been strained after the taiwanese parliament adopted a new law calling for a referendum on independence should china deploy its military might against the island . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a ship explodes during a taiwanese military excercises in october .
chinese rulers view this as a step toward a taiwanese declaration of independence .
deputy foreign minister zhou wenzhong said taiwanese plans for a referendum and a new constitution represented the “ biggest challenge so far ” for beijing ’ s “ one china ” policy and stability in the region . just days before chinese premier wen jiabao is due to visit washington , d.c. , zhou called on the u.s. to stop supplying taiwan with weapons .
while the u.s. doesn ’ t recognize taiwan , it functions as the island ’ s main arms supplier . schröder calls on china to end internet censorship the german chancellor ’ s visit to china coincided with the release of three dissidents , who had been jailed for criticizing the government in the internet . while the germans welcomed the move , schröder called upon beijing to end its internet censorship .
china could only reach its goal of becoming the world ’ s largest internet market within the next four years if foreign and national internet users had free access to information . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an internet cafe in china .
not all web sites can be viewed as many are censored by the government .
beijing has an estimated 30,000 censors scanning web sites and blocking access to pages with content unfavorable to the regime .

german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .
should the nuclear power really be supplied with european weapons ? at least , german business ca n't complain about gerhard schröder 's engagement when it comes to china .
during his visit there , the chancellor has tirelessly endeavored to open new doors and promote economic cooperation between the two countries .
and , above all , he has done it very adroitly and presented himself to his chinese interlocutors as a charismatic pragmatist with a strategic vision .
china 's government leaders like such movers and shakers - especially when they have predominantly pleasant messages to relay . which is why it 's clear that german businessmen and women will be grateful for the chancellor 's engagement in china , as will the german population presumably too .
for given germany 's crippled economy , everything has been well received that promised economic success .
and the people 's republic of china , with its 1.3 billion citizens , is an ideal venue for high-flying fantasies about capturing markets . but schröder overshoots the target when he assures his chinese partners that he will work within the eu to lift the european weapon embargo against beijing .
china is a different country than it was in 1989 when the students protests were violently suppressed - the chancellor is right about that .
the country is continually modernizing , and people profit from freedoms that were unthinkable just ten years ago on a daily basis . no significant progress in civil rights however , a brief glance at reports from human rights organizations like amnesty international could have demonstrated to schröder that in the sensitive area of civil rights beijing has still not made any significant progress .
there is still no freedom of political expression in china .
time and again there are politically-motivated arrests , most recently of internet dissidents .
and the death penalty still exists .
last year alone more than 1,000 people were sentenced to death . european weapons against taiwan ? schröder 's push for the weapons embargo to be lifted is questionable in a further regard : the people 's republic continues to view taiwan as a renegade province and threatens to respond to a declaration of independence on the part of the island with the force of arms . it is a relief that schröder does not want to begin supplying arms to taiwan , as he assured the chinese .
but why on earth would he want to supply them to beijing ?
it is incomprehensible that of all things european weapons should have to underpin china 's militaristic threats against taiwan . as if in justification , schröder said that the germans too know what it 's like to live in a divided country .
he must have misunderstood something .
there is one essential difference to the german situation : taiwan is by far more democratic today than the chinese mainland .
nor is it unimportant that west germany never tried to impose reunification with the force of arms . rainer sollich send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for end to arms embargo against china german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 03.12.2003 german cannibal trial opens in complexity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dilemma is not whether meiwes is guilty or not but with what charge to apply in the case .
the trial of armin meiwes , the cannibal who killed and ate a willing victim , began in the german town of kassel on wednesday with experts keenly watching the complex case which many believe could make legal history . the case of the german cannibal that alternately captivated and repulsed the world entered the trial stage on wednesday as proceedings began in a court in the german town of kassel . armin meiwes , the computer technician who killed and ate a willing victim he met over the internet , stands accused of " murder for sexual satisfaction , " a charge brought against him because cannibalism is not technically illegal under german law .
it is a trial so perplexing it could make legal history .
when the macabre case first came to the attention of the public , it was not only the fact that meiwes had killed and eaten almost half of victim bernd-jurgen brandes over a number of months at his home in rotenburg that disgusted and shocked the world .
willingness to die bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bernd jürgen brandes .
what really chilled the bones was the revelation that brandes had apparently volunteered himself to this fate by answering an ad meiwes had placed on a web site for cannibalism enthusiasts .
the fact that brandes applied for the position of the " well-built man , 18-30 years old , for slaughter " is the crux of the legal dilemma facing the court .
after admitting to killing brandes - " i admit what i 've done .
i accept that i am guilty and i regret my actions " - and with visual evidence to the fact available in the disturbing form of the footage filmed by the defendant at the time , the question is not whether meiwes will be convicted or not but on what charge .
if brandes willingly offered himself to meiwes for slaughter , as the video evidence of the whole incident suggests , then the problem , according to legal experts , is that a murder charge carrying a possible life sentence will be difficult to apply .
the alternative is for meiwes to be tried for manslaughter , a charge which carries a term of 15 years or considerably less , after which meiwes would be free .
illegal euthanasia in such an unprecedented case , both prosecution and defense teams are offering specifically refined charges to fit the bizarre crime .
the defendant ’ s lawyer insists that meiwes should be convicted of " killing on request , " a form of illegal euthanasia which carries a sentence of six months to five years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : meiwes ' house in the town of rotenburg an der fulda where brandes died .
however , while prosecutors acknowledge brandes said he wanted to die , they add that the victim may have been incapable of rational thought .
as meiwes passed a psychiatric examination which found that he was not insane , they believe that his actions took advantage of the state of mind of brandes and are therefore pushing for a charge of murder motivated by sexual urges to be applied .
they will also push for a life sentence on the basis that meiwes is simply too dangerous to ever be released .
complex proceedings professor arthur kreuzer of the institute for criminology at giessen university believes that the complexity of the trial may lead to the proceedings becoming a benchmark case .
“ this is killing undertaken for both killer and victim and can not be regarded as the worst case of premeditated killing , ” kreuzer told reuters .
" but i do n't think it is a killing on request either because it was not an altruistic , but an egoistic deed . "
kreuzer said the case may go as high as the federal constitutional court and that prosecutors may be forced to consult new medical experts to assess meiwes ' mental state despite the fact that the initial tests showed his mental state to be intact .
court will view video extracts the court in kassel will be shown extracts of the video meiwes made of the killing but only of dialogue between perpetrator and victim which highlights the agreement between them .
the court will also hear the testimony of a british respondent to a previous advert placed by meiwes who avoided a similar fate by changing his mind and leaving when he realized the cannibal ’ s intent was real . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german cannibal victim 's will found the apparent willing victim in the german cannibal murder left a will that indicates that he was fully aware of the fate that awaited him , according to investigators .

german government officials oppose this . eu funding could start as early as january , as a moratorium expires at the end of the year .
without a consensus in the eu council of ministers , individual funding requests will have to be approved by a two-thirds majority of member states .
" the commission will try to treat this issue wisely , " philippe busquin , the eu commissioner for research , said after wednesday ’ s meeting .
the german government immediately criticized possible eu funding for stem cell research .
" we expect that the eu commission will not end the moratorium and simply return to business as usual , " a german official told ap .
should funding commence , german tax payers would indirectly fund research that ’ s outlawed in their own country .
germany pushed for a moratorium pending the establishment of ethical guidelines .
eu research funds total € 2.2 billion -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- , around € 40 million of which could go towards scientists working with stem cells .
restrictions on research in germany german law only allows work on imported embryonic stem cells that have been harvested before jan .
2002 .
the cut-off date is meant to prevent the production of new embryos solely for the purpose of stem cell research .
research on embryonic stem cells is also only allowed under german law if no alternative exists , such as research animal stem cells or stem cells taken from adults .
because stem cells can develop into many different types of cells , they are unlike most other cells .
this makes them a valuable source of hard-to-get cells for transplants .
proponents see the research as a way to fight diseases like parkinson ’ s or alzheimer ’ s diseases in the future .
eu commission more liberal eu research commissioner philippe busquin had planned more liberal guidelines to fund stem cell research and has proposed a june 2002 cut-off-date for embryonic cells that can be used .
just two weeks ago , the european parliament had voted to fund research on embryonic stem cells no more than 14 days old or those which were left over from fertility treatments .
with support from austria , italy and portugal , germany managed to avoid a vote in favor of the commission ’ s proposal last week .
will eu ministers continue discussions ?
german government officials said they expected negotiations on the issue to continue in 2004 , when ireland takes over the rotating eu presidency .
but busquin countered that the irish would not revive the topic .

german chancellor gerhard schröder spoke out in favor of lifting the european weapon embargo against china during his visit to beijing .
should the nuclear power really be supplied with european weapons ? at least , german business ca n't complain about gerhard schröder 's engagement when it comes to china .
during his visit there , the chancellor has tirelessly endeavored to open new doors and promote economic cooperation between the two countries .
and , above all , he has done it very adroitly and presented himself to his chinese interlocutors as a charismatic pragmatist with a strategic vision .
china 's government leaders like such movers and shakers - especially when they have predominantly pleasant messages to relay . which is why it 's clear that german businessmen and women will be grateful for the chancellor 's engagement in china , as will the german population presumably too .
for given germany 's crippled economy , everything has been well received that promised economic success .
and the people 's republic of china , with its 1.3 billion citizens , is an ideal venue for high-flying fantasies about capturing markets . but schröder overshoots the target when he assures his chinese partners that he will work within the eu to lift the european weapon embargo against beijing .
china is a different country than it was in 1989 when the students protests were violently suppressed - the chancellor is right about that .
the country is continually modernizing , and people profit from freedoms that were unthinkable just ten years ago on a daily basis . no significant progress in civil rights however , a brief glance at reports from human rights organizations like amnesty international could have demonstrated to schröder that in the sensitive area of civil rights beijing has still not made any significant progress .
there is still no freedom of political expression in china .
time and again there are politically-motivated arrests , most recently of internet dissidents .
and the death penalty still exists .
last year alone more than 1,000 people were sentenced to death . european weapons against taiwan ? schröder 's push for the weapons embargo to be lifted is questionable in a further regard : the people 's republic continues to view taiwan as a renegade province and threatens to respond to a declaration of independence on the part of the island with the force of arms . it is a relief that schröder does not want to begin supplying arms to taiwan , as he assured the chinese .
but why on earth would he want to supply them to beijing ?
it is incomprehensible that of all things european weapons should have to underpin china 's militaristic threats against taiwan . as if in justification , schröder said that the germans too know what it 's like to live in a divided country .
he must have misunderstood something .
there is one essential difference to the german situation : taiwan is by far more democratic today than the chinese mainland .
nor is it unimportant that west germany never tried to impose reunification with the force of arms . rainer sollich send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de schröder calls for end to arms embargo against china german chancellor gerhard schröder has called for lifting the eu ’ s arms embargo against china .

german politicians may be grappling with a loss of image in the u.s. since the dispute over the iraq war , but artists aren ’ t complaining as german art enjoys a popularity boom with americans . whether in new york or st. louis , german art is hip , happening and in demand .
never mind the political tensions between the two countries ever since german chancellor schröder decided to oppose the u.s.-led war against iraq earlier this year .
a look at the art calendar shows that german artists , both old and contemporary , are fast becoming fashionable on the american art landscape .
the new york-based neue galerie devoted to early 20th century german and austrian art and design recently celebrated its two-year anniversary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german art now the exhibition " german art now " -lrb- photo -rrb- , which focuses on the international impact of german art in the second half of the 20th century and currently showing at the st. louis art museum , has been a success so far .
" the exhibition in st. louis has been a huge popular success and was even well received far beyond the city ’ s borders , " andrea firmenich , head of the cultural forum of german pharmaceuticals and chemicals group altana , which provided financial backing for the " german art now " exhibition , told dw-world .
and that ’ s not all .
another exhibition on german art at the beginning of the 20th century is on show at the busch-reisinger museum of the harvard university , while the vassar college in new york state is displaying works by renowned german sculptor käthe kollwitz .
art immune to political considerations " i believe , that public interest in german art has in fact increased in recent times , " dorothea dietrich , guest professor for 20th century art at the duke university said .
" earlier it was mainly french art that enjoyed attention in the u.s. , but now german art is increasingly become more important , " she said .
dietrich opined that the political dispute over the iraq war hasn ’ t had a negative impact on german art in the u.s.
" rather there was a negative fallout with relation to france . "
even anne wagner , professor for art history at the university of california in berkely and presently fellow at the american academy in berlin , agrees that the discord between u.s. and german politicians hasn ’ t spilled over onto the art scene .
" in my opinion , the political problems over the war in iraq had no implications for the reception of german art in the u.s. perhaps , it ’ s that art lovers tend to be less nationalistic than other people or maybe they think that art is not a direct reflection of politics , " she mused .
wagner points towards widely-acclaimed east german contemporary artist gerhard richter as a case in point .
" a good example of that is the gerhard richter exhibition in the u.s. last year , which was a huge success .
and no one was less interested in richter ’ s achievements because of the strained relations between germany and the u.s. , " she emphasized .
andrea firmenich of the atlanta group stressed that art could act as a bridge in the communication process between nations and could provide thought-provoking impulses .
" artists still speak to one another long after politicians have nothing more to say . "
firmenich added " german and american artists have always maintained a vigorous exchange and that ’ s happening again . "
" now more than ever " there are indications that the current surge in popularity for german art in the u.s. may not be a short-lived one .
" the opening of the neue galerie in new york provided an important push to the popularity of german art , " art professor dietrich explained .
even the atlanta cultural forum plans to continue with its engagement in the u.s. , independent of the political climate between germany and the u.s. firmenich emphasized that " now more than ever " is the motto in the art world ever since the german-american fallout over the iraq war . michael knigge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic picture of the day dw-tv europe live journal - nachrichten mit tagesthema we 're sorry , due to legal issues this content can not be transmitted as live stream .

samad - not his real name - became hiv positive in the united states , but has since returned home , where he presents workshops on aids awareness .
he established the lankan plus support group last year .
" my motive in this is for them to be able to survive like me , because i 've come a long way , and they can also do it , " samad told bbc world service 's outlook programme .
" i 've had a straightforward , normal life .
in the beginning , they always said aids means death , and a lot of people just gave up hope .
" that 's the worst thing that could happen . "
tv campaign samad found out he was hiv positive after a medical test shortly before he was due to begin what he described as his " dream job " - a chef on the world 's biggest cruise liner .
" all i thought was - ' i 'm going to die ' .
for me it was like a death sentence , " he recalled .
my mouth gets me a long way , because i 've broken the boundaries of speaking out " after a couple of months , i thought , ' no - i 'm not going to let this get me down . '
" and then i learned to live . "
samad 's most recent project has been to an attempt to air a 30-second tv programme on stigma and discrimination over aids .
sri lanka 's national station is prohibited from airing it , but samad has now been able to persuade a private network to show it .
meanwhile he continues to run lankan plus - which started off with 17 members , but deaths this year have reduced that number to 13 .
samad told outlook that due to distance the members were not able to meet very often , but kept in touch through mail .
" lanka plus was registered only last year .
it 's fairly new , and the first time in sri lanka that positive people have got together and tried to organise something , " he said .
" actually this is the extension of a undp project , which started last year .
it 's all over asia and the pacific . "
but he conceded that the energies he was devoting to these projects took their toll .
" there 's a thing called burnout , where enough is enough , " he said .
" any human being needs a distraction , something else to hold on to ... this is a very emotional and heavy subject to involved with , because you are talking about human lives here . "
responsibility samad said his main focus away from his battle with aids was a drag act he performs at various private functions .
but even can be difficult , he added , because he was openly gay in a country where homosexuality is banned .
some gay groups in sri lanka are helping the government in its aids awareness programme " if i do have the chance of going abroad , where they have broadway musicals , but all done in drag , i would like to be one of the cast .
" even just back-up dancing i would love - it 's one of my dreams . "
samad stated that because of sri lanka 's attitude towards homosexuals , he found it very difficult to be himself in his own country , and was often tempted to leave .
" there are lot of cultural restraints - homosexuals are -lsb- viewed as -rsb- very bad people , with bad morals , " he argued .
" it 's not an easy life if you 're looking to have a normal life .
one of my dreams would be to have my partner with me until my last breathing time .
" i ca n't really find that here in sri lanka . "
but he added that despite these restraints , he felt a duty towards the other members of lankan plus , and this kept him in the country .
" i 've got my responsibility towards my positive members , and the positive people here in sri lanka , because i 'm in a position where i can really empower them to take over , and build up that system , " he said .
" maybe in four or five years , once it 's stable , i might move on and leave the reins for somebody else to take the torch on . "

the nhs chief executive , sir nigel crisp , revealed a rise in day case surgery and a fall in hospital waiting times in his six-month progress report .
he said many more patients were being treated without being admitted to hospital .
but critics say the extra millions being pumped into the nhs by the government are not having an impact .
we are relying on short term , stopgap solutions tim yeo , shadow health and education secretary the audit commission , in a report earlier this year said government targets were leading to " quick fix " solutions which would not improve patient care in the long term .
and a report from the centre for policy studies this week criticises the government for increasing the numbers of managers in the nhs .
it says the number of senior managers employed by the health service increased by 48 % between 1995 and 2001 , but the number of nurses employed only increased by just under 8 % .
criticisms the nhs report , launched on wednesday , claims that the nhs has been consistently improving over the last three years .
figures for the numbers of people being seen in hospital have in the past shown only modest rises .
but the government says increasing numbers of patients are being treated in the community .
it says outpatient procedures increased by 15 % between april and september .
key statistics day case surgery - up 14.9 % inpatient waits -lrb- 6 months -rrb- - down 28.5 % outpatient waits -lrb- 13 weeks -rrb- - down 38 % there has also been a decrease in the number of patients waiting more than six months for inpatient operations .
in the past year , the number waiting has fallen by 28.5 % to 177 , 867 in contrast to a fall of 5.9 % between september 2000 and september 2002 .
health secretary john reid said progress was being made : " the number waiting longer than six months has fallen by almost 30 % in the last year alone , and the fall is even faster in the number of people waiting 13 weeks for an outpatient appointment , which has reduced by 38 % in the last year alone .
" these are important findings .
the nhs is far from perfect , but these figures show clearly why those who work in it deserve our thanks . "
sir nigel crisp told the bbc : " many more people are getting treated without having to be admitted to hospital .
there is much more activity in gp surgeries and outpatient clinics . "
some doctors have expressed concerns that the targets set out by the government may be skewing clinical priorities .
but sir nigel said : " all decisions about patient care should be based on clinical need . "
gill morgan , chief executive of the nhs confederation , said : " this report challenges recent misleading claims about the state of the nhs .
it confirms what our members are telling us about an nhs that has made impressive progress by treating more patients more quickly and more conveniently . "
concerns but shadow secretary state for health and education , tim yeo mp said : " nhs staff are doing the best they can .
however , although improvements are occurring , they are minor given the amount of money poured into the nhs .
" despite the headline figures , the reality beneath the surface is that nursing and gp recruitment is as difficult as ever .
" as a nation we are relying on short term , stopgap solutions in a bid for good headlines not long term solutions leading to sustainable recruitment . "
and liberal democrat health spokesman paul burstow said : " the nhs report does not reflect the pain and frustration felt by many patients in britain today .
" nor does it take account of the fact that many people going to hospital catch other illnesses due to lack of cleanliness in some wards . "
" all the report shows is that what gets measured gets done .
" getting the nhs to judge its own success is like getting school children to mark their own exam papers . "
gordon brown has promised nhs spending will rise from £ 65.4bn in 2002 to £ 87.2bn in 2006 .

the nhs chief executive , sir nigel crisp , revealed a rise in day case surgery and a fall in hospital waiting times in his six-month progress report .
he said many more patients were being treated without being admitted to hospital .
but critics say the extra millions being pumped into the nhs by the government are not having an impact .
we are relying on short term , stopgap solutions tim yeo , shadow health and education secretary the audit commission , in a report earlier this year said government targets were leading to " quick fix " solutions which would not improve patient care in the long term .
and a report from the centre for policy studies this week criticises the government for increasing the numbers of managers in the nhs .
it says the number of senior managers employed by the health service increased by 48 % between 1995 and 2001 , but the number of nurses employed only increased by just under 8 % .
criticisms the nhs report , launched on wednesday , claims that the nhs has been consistently improving over the last three years .
figures for the numbers of people being seen in hospital have in the past shown only modest rises .
but the government says increasing numbers of patients are being treated in the community .
it says outpatient procedures increased by 15 % between april and september .
key statistics day case surgery - up 14.9 % inpatient waits -lrb- 6 months -rrb- - down 28.5 % outpatient waits -lrb- 13 weeks -rrb- - down 38 % there has also been a decrease in the number of patients waiting more than six months for inpatient operations .
in the past year , the number waiting has fallen by 28.5 % to 177 , 867 in contrast to a fall of 5.9 % between september 2000 and september 2002 .
health secretary john reid said progress was being made : " the number waiting longer than six months has fallen by almost 30 % in the last year alone , and the fall is even faster in the number of people waiting 13 weeks for an outpatient appointment , which has reduced by 38 % in the last year alone .
" these are important findings .
the nhs is far from perfect , but these figures show clearly why those who work in it deserve our thanks . "
sir nigel crisp told the bbc : " many more people are getting treated without having to be admitted to hospital .
there is much more activity in gp surgeries and outpatient clinics . "
some doctors have expressed concerns that the targets set out by the government may be skewing clinical priorities .
but sir nigel said : " all decisions about patient care should be based on clinical need . "
gill morgan , chief executive of the nhs confederation , said : " this report challenges recent misleading claims about the state of the nhs .
it confirms what our members are telling us about an nhs that has made impressive progress by treating more patients more quickly and more conveniently . "
concerns but shadow secretary state for health and education , tim yeo mp said : " nhs staff are doing the best they can .
however , although improvements are occurring , they are minor given the amount of money poured into the nhs .
" despite the headline figures , the reality beneath the surface is that nursing and gp recruitment is as difficult as ever .
" as a nation we are relying on short term , stopgap solutions in a bid for good headlines not long term solutions leading to sustainable recruitment . "
and liberal democrat health spokesman paul burstow said : " the nhs report does not reflect the pain and frustration felt by many patients in britain today .
" nor does it take account of the fact that many people going to hospital catch other illnesses due to lack of cleanliness in some wards . "
" all the report shows is that what gets measured gets done .
" getting the nhs to judge its own success is like getting school children to mark their own exam papers . "

prosecutors allege that the bank used illegal front companies to take over executive life in 1991 .
the announcement of an investigation follows a failure of the french and us governments to agree a settlement .
a successful prosecution could result in credit lyonnais losing its valuable us banking licence , as well as possible sanctions against individuals .
at the centre of the case is french tycoon francois pinault , who allegedly looked after executive life 's assets in order to disguise credit lyonnais ' involvement .
talks collapse the purchase of executive life , prosecutors say , was structured in such a way as illegally to avoid restrictions on foreign ownership of us insurers .
credit lyonnais allegedly passed on the insurer 's assets , mainly in the form of junk bonds , to artemis , a firm owned by mr pinault , a close friend of president jacques chirac .
officials on both sides of the atlantic have been struggling to avoid a criminal case for years .
a deal had been reached which would have broadly indemnified credit lyonnais and cdr , a french state agency that manages some of the bank 's assets .
but talks broke down when the french government rejected washington 's insistence that mr pinault receive only limited legal protection .
last ditch according to media reports , us prosecutors wanted mr pinault to put up a surety of $ 185m , and allow his $ 250m stake in artemis - now renamed aurora - to be frozen .
the financial commitment was seen as a necessary guarantee of good faith ahead of any possible civil legal action .
french finance minister francis mer insisted that the affair could still be resolved through negotiation .
most observers believe that a settlement of some sort will eventually preclude outright criminal penalties .
credit crunch but if the investigation drags on for much longer , the consequences for credit lyonnais could be all the more severe .
the bank , which is now privatised after nearly going bankrupt and being bailed out by the state in the mid-1990s , is believed vulnerable to having its us banking licence withdrawn .
the executive life affair is the most unrelenting in a series of scandals that haunt credit lyonnais , mainly resulting from its activities in the 1980s and 1990s .
under state ownership , it enjoyed close links with french government officials , and questions are now being asked about the ethics of many of its decisions at the time - in particular its lavish lending policy .

mr thaksin told a rally in bangkok that thousands of " bad people " had been arrested during the 10-month campaign .
he brushed off criticism from human rights groups that have accused police of murdering hundreds of suspected dealers .
police have blamed most of the deaths on inter-gang violence .
police say they have arrested about 90,000 people on drugs-related charges since the campaign started in february and have seized more than 40 million methamphetamine pills and assets worth 1.8bn baht -lrb- $ 45m -rrb- from suspected dealers .
" some of the bad guys have died , and some of them are serving prison terms .
i am ready to confront them in every way , " mr thaksin said at a ceremony on wednesday .
according to official statements , 2,245 drugs suspects were killed between 1 february and 30 april alone .
' investigations needed ' police say only a few dozen of the victims have been killed by police , and those have been shot in self-defence .
but london-based rights group amnesty international criticised the thai government in a report last month for failing to initiate " independent , impartial , effective and prompt investigations " into the killings .
charun ditha-appichai of the national human rights committee said he welcomed the government 's commitment to stamping out drugs , but said it had caught few major traffickers .

hundreds of carcasses have already been washed up on south west beaches so far this year .
but the peak season for dolphins and porpoises washing up on the south west coast is approaching , with at least six found dead in devon last week .
they drown after being caught in fishermen 's nets , and a cross-party select committee of mps is investigating how to stop that .
pair trawling the committee will hear on wednesday from devon campaigner linda hingley , of brixham seawatch , which monitors dolphin deaths .
she wants a ban on pair trawling until measures are introduced which stop dolphins being caught .
pair trawling involves two boats dragging a huge net between them .
fisheries minister and exeter mp ben bradshaw will also present his proposals for tackling the problem to the committee .
escape hatches he is suggesting escape hatches in nets , but ms hingley says his plans will not work .
she said : " people do n't realise that these trawl nets are so big you could park seven jumbo jets inside them .
" the biggest problem with them is the dolphins swim into these trawls while feeding on fish already in them and they do n't realise they are caught . "
the cornwall wildlife trust launched a hotline last month so people could contact them if they found a dolphin washed up on a beach .
they hope the hotline will allow experts to identify the cause of death quickly and speed up measures to reduce the number of fatalities .
